For humans? No. But a water strider can. Have you heard of surface tension? A water strider, because of how light and spread out it's mass is, can stand on water because of the attraction between the water particles or surface tension. Attraction between particles of the same substance is called cohesive forces. Please note that this may not be accurate because I learned it a long time ago, but I hope this helps?
Yes in dreams.
Yes it's called puddles
you can walk on water if you walk really fast
When it is frozen, yes.
In your dreams, you can!
Yes, your penis is a very good size. It is much bigger than the average of 5 to 6 inches being 7 inches. And your girth of 5.3 inches is much bigger than the average of 4 inches. You indeed do have a very good penis size.
Good. healthy-relationship-dating.com/average...
You're large, and I was identical to you at 14-1/2. I was also 5'11, and I grew to age 20, ending at 8" with 6.5" girth, and 6'2. You likely are not done with puberty yet.
Yes your larger than average for an adult. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches so your very good.
that is a great size. Look me up when you are 18
That's a very good size, bigger than a lot of guys
Very large, 2 inches above average length and bigger in girth as well.
I know a man that has a 9 inch Dick he was from Norway
Love it.I attempted Prolargentsize, supposing it most likely wouldn't help any. However , I got genuine great results!
Larger side of average similar to me
Don't submerge any body parts into ice water, you could get frostbite within minutes, but I doubt you could take the pain to even get close to that point. Just use a regular ice pack or wrap ice cubes in a towel. And just use for at least 10 minutes a few times day, but if you have just had an injury or whatever use it for as long you want (maximum would be until the ice cubes melt). If you can you should take an anti-inflammatory drug, follow instructions.
Ice your foot about 20 minutes at a time. But a cold pack is probably better than putting your whole foot in an ice bath.
What's it swollen from? A sprain? Ice does help a sprain,but you need to alternate it with room temperature. Congestive heart failure can caused swollen ankles, in which case ice will do nothing.
15 in 15 out. Repeatedly.
Heck yeah i would. I would swap with my twin sister but only if it was just for one day. Because she would try to keep it. she's always wanted to be a boy and jealous that I have a weiner. And I've always wondered what it would be like to have a vagina like her. She's probably more boy than I am, and I'm probably more girl and she is. So it would be cool to be able to swap.
No. It doesn't seem like it as easy to get off for women.
Maybe. It would be interesting to see what it feels like to have sex from their perspective.
for just one day of course i would and with my luck i would end up on a day when i have my period
or one day? Hell yeah...for more than that..hell no
No.
I like what Lorraine said continue being alive. You should seek help from a therapist. If you don't have the money, try a free mental health clinic.
Definitely not. They should get help, and receive support. Have you been raped and/or stalked? If so, please talk to someone, and get help. I'm so sorry that you had to suffer one of the most horrific things on the planet. I hope everything gets better. Take care xx.
I think everyone is their own unique little snowflake and what is good for one person isn't going to be good for another. So yes some should and no some shouldn't.
No because if you kill yourself you are letting the rapist win. You should contact your therapist and tell him/her what's going on. You should also take legal action if you have proof.
This is what is called a loaded question. A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt).
No, you shouldn't. You should seek help from a therapist. If you don't have the money, try a free mental health clinic.
NO... But whoever is it about- should immediately get the professional help of a psychologist or psychiatrist thereof-in real life-in the area...
why not talk to someone first like a family member or a doctor
There should be suicide booths for whiny, attention whores who want to die.
no
Yes, very possible specially if it was unprotected sex or the condom broke? & if therequired was light bleeding pinkish/brownish it might have been implantation bleeding. Do some research on it only you can know what it was like. Goodluck!:)
that's the ONLY time you could get pregnant - get a test
Could be.
yes you could be
day of ovulation (not intentionally
No, there is nothing wrong with eating salad for lunch every day. In fact, some experts recommend salad with either meat or fish on a daily basis. Add some fruit, and you'll be just fine.
Salad is one of the things you SHOULD be eating everyday. As long as it's not iceberg lettuce, but a green that actually gives you some major benefit- like Kale, Spinach, or mixed greens.
not if it is a variety of salads with a variety of ingredients with a range of different food groups. do have pasta or bread or something occasionally, too, to keep balanced.
Insufficient carbohydrate. Include cold boiled potatoes to improve it. Coleslaw would also add vitamins and minerals.
No. Excellent.
If you have a light flow you should be fine with a panty liner. If your flow is heavier you can try two but they're likely to fall off. I am not sure of the reasoning behind not using tampons but if it is an option for the future I would highly recommend starting to use them so getting your period doesn't prohibit you from living your life! Either way, if you're flow is heavy I would recommend staying out of the water and keeping a pad on.
water Does Not stop your Flow- your period Will Come out- it is not sanitary if your flow is med-heavy
That would be against the health codes. It is against the law to do that.
Please don't. Would you be accommodating to sharing the water slide with me and my diarrhea?
Errr!!!
yes nothing should happen
Rumor? Not a rumor, it's factual truth. Women tend to take better care of their health than men do. Men tend to overlook warning signs and tough it out when they're having health issues rather than getting treatment. Man also tend to work in more physically risky jobs then do women. Men also take more risks in life when do women. All of these things statistically shorten the lifespan of the average male. It's just reality.
It's true. Life expectancy in the west is mid 80s with women 2-3 years more than men.
It's due to many factors, such as a possibly better immune system in females, to females being more willing to seek treatment, to males being more risky. The last part doesn't come as a surprise. I like to think that we males are "coded" to act as if we were more expendable.
"Women may live longer than men because of their stronger immune systems, say researchers. They believe females are born with an inner strength which works more effectively and for longer than it does in males
Not a myth, it's statistically true
idk
I'm 16 and have this for near my labia, it's very small not even the size of my pinky nail, it's flat, painless, and doesn't itch. I'm a virgin. I thought it was melanoma, but I don't have the other symptoms (pain, itching, lump, bleeding) I do have A LITTLE discharge here and there. I'm still scared its cancer even though the possibility is slim to none, since I am young, and healthy. if it isn't cancer/ melanoma... what is it ??? I'm scared
It is something totally harmless. next time you are in to see your doctor, ask her about it she can see it.
You'll find through the years that these things do happen to women of all ages. My advise to keep it clean or abstain. Cold sores and such could possibly give herpes, so be careful and safe okay Take Care. First time I was 19 and called my mother at work screaming hysterical. I understand.
Sounds like a mole or naevus. Commonly referred to as birthmarks
Yes. You can get cancer of the uterus if you are female but overies is not a real word so it can't be diseased.
Uterine cancer begins in the uterus. Ovarian cancer begins in the ovaries. Cancer of the fallopian tubes is also referred to as ovarian cancer, as is a couple of others that begin in that general area and spread to the ovaries. Most gynecological cancers have similar treatment plans that include surgery and chemotherapy. Some of them may also include radiation, but not as a standard of care.
As pointed out, they are different. They can spread, my uterine cancer did spread to an ovary, but it's still uterine cancer.
Uterine cancer is on the uterus, ovarian cancer in on the ovaries. They are two totally different diseases.
It's 2 different organs...
Nope, it's called being a teenager and motivation :)
That would make you even more lazy as you don't even want to own your own problem you want someone to do it for you.
If you have insurance and wish to improve, go. Or get someone to take you
no you shouldn't and when you get hungry enough you'll go and make it
No, just wait it out, eventually you'll starve to death.
No, speaking as a medical professional to bring up that kind of law suit you would have to prove gross negligence not a simple misdiagnoses which is common. My own mother went into one ER and was diagnosed with body aches after 4 days of testing and she was then release with pain pills. Two days later we went into an ER in a different hospital and she was diagnosed with Stage 4 Burikit's Lymphoma. She died 6 months later. We didn't sue anyone. It happened and nothing we do now will change it.
Unlikely. The ER s a bad place to go for a complete diagnosis. Their job is to treat those needing urgent care and make patients comfortable enough to follow up wwith their regular doctor as soon as possible.
Probably not great. Why would he go to a hospital with non-urgent complaints. If he went to an ER, then the only thing they do is rule out and treat emergent conditions. It's up to the patient to follow up with their regular physician.
1. Prudent to find a cure on top priority. 2. Survival is next to nothing.
Nope, not grounds for a lawsuit.
Whatever
It's suit and no.
Try not to worry as its better for your immune system. I am sure you had a shower when you got home and threw your clothes in the washing machine. I know I would have done! Also take some vitamin C and eat well. Apart from that no sense worrying about what hasn't happened. Get well soon.
My God -- you're completely paranoid. Seek therapy for THAT! Otherwise, stay in your room, pull the covers over your head, and don't ever come out! If you come out, you might CATCH something!
You want to stay healthy then stay away from doctor's/clinics offices. You want to be weak and have someone take care of you go to doctor's/clinics offices. You can't have it both ways.
Geeze oh Petes!!!! How do you make it through a day? You encounter germy people every day. Maybe you should live in a bubble.
Either you will or you won't
Your bf is responsible for his own diet. Rice and sugary pop raise blood sugars quickly, but if he accounted for the carbs he was consuming and took the proper amount of insulin, then he is managing his diabetes. [NINE !! months, and you forgot? - Let him handle his own life.] p s PERMISSIBLE - and, yes.
There are recipe books for diabetics.
He's the diabetic ding dong ask HIM and HE should be southbound HIMSELF
NOTHING with sugar in it. COok Low Carb. Avoid rice, potatoes, pasta, bread, and anything with flour in it.
Vitamin D has nothing to do with blood sugar.
Being honest the directions say to take 1 pill whenever you want. Well for me this wasn't exactly the case. I tried Prolargent 5x5 Extreme and it worked okay. Then I decided to try 2 the next time. 2 worked excellent for me! I would say to try 2 pills if one doesn't work.
These work great and they make a BIG difference. Me and my wife have a great sex life but why not make it better with the Prolargent 5x5 Extreme enhancement pills? They provided me with a size increase and a lot more stamina. Great for guys that suffer from erectile dysfunction as well. I'm very happy with my purchase and would definitely consider ordering more.
There are various pills and powders I tried that claims harder and last longing activity. But i can assure that there is no other product on this planet that works as good as ProlargentSize and it keeps me energetic other than arousing me.
Like = usually go together. < M
I had oral surgery last Thursday, and to preempt infection my surgeon prescribed me cephalaxin (an antibiotic). Unfortunately, antibiotics can cause stomach upset, especially in people with gastrointestinal problems (which I do have). I keep getting painful abdominal cramps that make me need to use the bathroom. I've discontinued the antibiotic's use yesterday after talking to my doctor. I know I'm not the infectious sort of unwell, but I'm concerned that my cramps might interfere with my work. Because I am new to my job - which is only my second job ever - I am worried that I will be written up or somehow punished for calling in sick. What should I do?
if you can't function properly, then you shouldn't be there. I'm assuming you have taken the past few days off already, give a call and explain there were some other issue that came up and that you won't be able to preform. They should understand. It also depends on the potion and such that you are in but basically, if you can't do the job, it's a waste to be there.
Just call in sick and get a doctors note if you have to.
yes, you should, you can't be expected to work feeling the way you do. Take the day to go to your doctor asap and tell him/her about the problems. Hopefully a change of medication!!
Yes.
That'll be pretty stupid plus ➕ that'll hurt something fierce - besides you'll probably feint if you don't receive prompt medical 😷 attention plus ➕ it'll be difficult to re attach the finger - my friend had his arm 🙋 chopped off 📴 and almost died and had to have his arm 🙋 using microsurgery using a surgeon and he was even stabbed and I assure you I don't think it was a laughing 😂 matter it was more towards sad 😔
Sadly, I don't think it would make a difference to your perception of reality but you might lose a ton of blood
Yes. In any case, heaven is not going to fall because of this misadventure.
No, but it will get you put in a hospital in a padded room until your shrink can get your medication regulated
Yea, it's fun!
Yeah, during the period of intense pain, but then you're back to normal, whatever that is.
So I'm starting a new school tomorrow, I'm in Year 9 and it's a middle of the year transfer. I don't have severe acne or anything like that but a couple of days ago, 6 unready to pop pimples popped up on my face, I haven't been to school since because I was transferring schools anyway but school's starting tomorrow and 3 of them are really red and visible even from a distance. I really don't want to go to school with huge red pimples and make a bad impression that "the new girl has acne". What can I do? The pimples aren't ready to pop yet, they're big and red and I don't have any concealer :(
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I really like this Arganrain oil because it comes with everything you need for a healthy skin. My acne scars cleared up completely. I recommend you use it for acne problems.
Sorry but there is not much you can do to treat them in just one day. Just don't pick at them or put any moisturiser them as that would make them worse. Concealer (oil free) is all you can use to hide them I'm afraid
Do you have statistics about this topic? Because if not Id like to know, what is considered a large amount? To be honest I think at some point in almost everyone's life that they go through some sort of depression or anxiety. Mental illness is common for a lot of people, whether it be contributed from environmental factors or it is hereditary.
That's like asking why brilliant people are more likely to be atheists. If there is any actual correlation, it likely would have to do with high intelligence and how it can come at the price of including depression, bipolar, ADD, or similar conditions. Einstein, an atheist, had Asperger's Syndrome, a mild form of autism. I have both bipolar disorder and a validly tested IQ in the 'mega genius category'. I have been both religious and irreligious. I was a locally ordained minister in my early twenties, but am now an atheist.
Because you think Conservapedia is a good source of information.
"large amount of atheists" is all that is needed to point out your mental deficiency.
it's just a correlation, not causation
conservapedia. ha Ha HA! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
well... i dont know anyone who said "well... now that i have a sixpack i dont think it was worth it, better go back to cake"
No. It's worth the effort to get a stronger core, but caring about how they look is tantamount to stupid. Some get them without work and some can do crunches until they're blue in the face and still have a layer of fat.
Developing a strong core is beneficial for any type of physical activity. It also helps with sustaining a healthier posture...among other things.
I am afraid of cigarette and it's lifelong consequences but my friends insist that I am afraid of my parents and that I am ascardy cat. I wanna prove them wrong but I don't wanna succumb to peer pressure. I have never been so good at controlling myself, I am afraid if I give it a shot I will never be able to quit again.
No it takes stupidity. Smoking isn't just extremely harmful too your health it's also the most unattractive thing I can imagine, it colours your teeth/fingers a nasty yellow, gives you a disgusting cough over the years and that's not even mentioning the amount of money you will be wasting on them for the rest of your life once you get addicted.
You need new friends. I started at 11 years of age, I am now 43. I have quit smoking, but the damage is done, I am slowly dying of COPD. Not being able to breath really sucks, DON'T DO IT!!!!
No it takes guts to overcome the peer pressure and be a better person than your friends
Yes
I wouldn't know, smoking is discusting and really bad for you, about 89% of my family smokes, it's horrible
Yes it does - I always remember being offered a cigarette when I was 15 years old - we were standing at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday and my mate got his packet out during the service and offered them round. One lad said no though but he had one puff of mine.
Feeling low to due to not liking how you look is normal you just need to gain some confidence I'm sure you are a nice and kind person do a great job it's just you don't feel good about yourself so maybe talking to a doctor about prescribing a medication for your acne would be helpful ...Your CV won't say you quit unless you put it on there or you tell the next interviewer you don't need too just say "I had an apprenticeship ,I'm just figuring out what I enjoy doing " I love the Opportunity you are offering .
Everything will get better. You don't need to list your apprenticeship on your CV. Just get another job. If your acne is really a big problem, try going to a different doctor or a specialist. But, considering working with a therapist, who will really help you figure out ways to live a better, happier, more fulfilling life, and be patient. The psychologist Viktor Frankl said that we don't know our destiny until we face the unique challenges that life puts us through. The challenges you are facing now are yours. Face them, solve them as best you can, and you will come out a happier, stronger, better person. Hang in there!
If your acne is affecting your life this much, you need to get help for it. You don't have to live with acne. See your doctor and ask to be referred to a dermatologist.
well, it sounds to me that the best thing for you to do-is getting examined in real life-in your area- by a dermatologist- as there are medical solutions= prescription drugs meant and able to treat acne and make you feel much better... let your Family Doctor there know exactly what you're going through- including your depression - as you depicted it to us here- and let him/her responsibly decide what is to be done...
My granddaughter had bad acne and we bought her Proactiv and it worked. Have you tried it? You can buy it online for about $20.00. It requires 3 applications which you will receive with instructions, but she followed them and her acne went away. May the Lord bless you hereafter with clear skin. Do not fear or be depressed, fear has torment. Pray and turn your troubles over to the Lord and let Him help you through them. It is God who gives us favor with people. He can open doors that you never thought could be opened for you.
I still throw spilt salt over my shoulder to keep the Devil off my back, I guess its just a family tradition thats been going around in my family through many generations so I guess I'm just accustomed to doing it naturally
No, none at all. None of them, if you read about them, even make a world of sense, and are just laughable.
No. Atheist.
no
No.
How about therapy? Or.. here's something totally novel... what about medication! You think? Cause you patting her on the back and saying "It's ok honey, I love you" hasn't worked so far. That's not known to be very effective.... What she needs to do is go see a doctor... a REAL doctor. for a real diagnosis and real treatment. If she doesn't then you can plan on another year just like the last one.... and another, and another, and another....
I feel bad for this girl, but it is an unfair burden on you. Contact her parents/family and explain the difficulties she is having. She needs professional help really bad. You can't keep up this 'babysitting' or your education and life will suffer.
Exhausted after only a year? Just imagine how you will feel after years and years of what you have described without sings of improvement? You need to decide now what you are willing to put yourself through or not and whether it's worth it.
I was prescribed very weak glasses with 0.5 and 0.25 farsighted measurements and 0.75 and 0.5 astigmatism correction. Will wearing the glasses often make the farsightedness worse. I didn't even know i was farsighted, but i suffered frequent headaches and eye fatigue which is why i got the glasses. I am 18 years old which is quite young. Will the glasses make the farsightedness worse to the point where I will start to notice it? I believe my visual acuity without them is quite good at 20/30 in one and 20/25 in the other. I got the glasses mainly for eye fatigue and headaches. Will they make it worse?
You probably are not far sighted. As I understand it, your prescription looks something like this: +0.25 -0.75 x 90. The same prescription could also be written -0.50 +0.75 x 180. The above prescriptions are exactly the same, yet one has a number in the sphere column that would imply myopia and the other hyperopia. In fact the person has neither.
No it will not make it worse, the astigmatism sis worse then the farsightedness. Wearing the glasses keeps you from straining and lets you see CLEARLY, this is the BIG bonus.
yes it does. eat carrots and practice squinting. I stopped using my glasses for one year while at military school and when I came back my optometrist told me my vision had improved and gave me a weaker prescription.
Unfortunately you're not alone there are so many people who have a life like that, I'm over 30 and have the same problems, shy, don't like to talk with anybody not in person or on the phone I don't like myself but is better to ignore those things and keep just living a normal life, but you'r not the only one if that helps since is our personality kind of, it doesn't get better with time.
You are a carbon copy of me. You are born to live your life how you want to and make choices that pleases you. Let the phone ring on, don't go out etc if that is what you want. It doesn't mean you don't have a life - far from it.
Go to counselling
All your problems are interconnected and once you solve one of them all of them will go away
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
No, no reason it would. You burn at most 100 calories masturbating and ejaculating semen. All the fat guys you see your age probably do it as much if not more than you, and you can see how it affects them- it doesn't.
Masturbation has no effect on your weight smart one. SMH
No. You need to begin with a fitness program.
No. If it did, there wouldn't be any fat men.
nope
no it doesn't
man ! i have the same situation
Before it gets further deteriorated, please take some or the other drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. Consult a professionally qualified doctor forthwith and take further necessary action as per the doctors good words of advice.
You should let your parents know, if they don't already. Also, consult your family doctor! Good luck! Don't worry about it too much! :)
Thats completely normal, after you ejaculate, theres still semen inside which will only be flushed by peeing, others guys can stop their ejaculation from squirting so the semen goes back to the urine reservoir. Urethra.
Most guys do that, guys generally will have residual semen in their urethra after ejaculating plus most guys will continue to leak out semen or precum for as much as an hour after ejaculation.
That's not unheard of. If you for some reason are not able to ejaculate all of the semen out of your urethra as would be normal, it will get flushed out when you urinate.
well, there will be semen left in your urethra after ejaculating - perfectly normal
garret is correct
actually its 24 not 30....... but still you have to start getting better right now, dont say you shouldnt worry, but if you wait until 24 you will be having a hard time..... do yourself a favor and start exercising and eat less then when you become 24 you will be having a good shape.. dont listen to those people saying you should eat, they are trying to make you feel good about eating.... you can eat but make sure you exercise because thats very important.... dont be like me, i ate a lot when i was 15 and now i am 20 i am very big size i cant even get up from my bed.... i cant move anywhere.
Falsefalse
no it's not true.you should care about your weight after 15 of age
Very wrong you are storing fat in your arteries.
Not true.
haha no.
Your penis is perfectly fine. A lot of guys have a curve in their penis and this is completely normal and nothing to worry about. It will not cause you any problems. Also, your penis at 7 inches is a lor bigger than average and a wonderful size. Your penis is fine.
Yes your normal, 7 is a good size. And a curve erect penis is normal, some guys including have upward erect penis, some erect penis are pointing to the left or right. When i was young it was also curving and downward but i correct it when i was circumcized when i was 15. Be proud of yourself dude, coz im proud of mine and im proud of you.
Curvature affects about one in four boys. There's N-curve, S-curve and J-curve aka banana. They don't actually impact on sexual performance, despite what you may think to the contrary (a vagina is also curved). Size has nothing to do with anything.
What help do you require. That seems perfectly adequate for ANYTHING you can think of. Yes , bigger penes often do curve, should not affect sex. < M
Increasing the muscles under your breasts isn't going to give you a noticeable increase in breast size, your pec muscles just don't contribute much to your cup size. There is some evidence, however, that keeping your pec muscles strong can help reduce the amount your breasts sag as you get older.
No it's not true, breasts are made up of fat and tissue and size cannot be increased with exercise or by massaging them, you can increase the muscle in the chest around your breasts and that can make them look more pert but it wont make them bigger.
Yes, depending on the body structure it' some times help. although massaging is also effective. Augmentation is also good to increase breast size. Enhance Clinics is good for this.
Breast size is determined by genetics. Other than that, the only 2 ways that you increase their size is through gaining weight or surgery. Doing exercises such as bench presses & flyes will make your breasts "perkier", but they won't get bigger.
Bottom hair can be quite sexy and it is natural to have some there.
Hair is there normally and a normal guy should have no problem with a hairy butt on a guy he is servicing.
Guys just don't look around.
nice and macho
yuck yuck yuck
Arthritis, underactive thyroid, type 2 diabetic and teeth are not very good.
External hemmaroods.
Mr E suffers from an interference in his brain.
if you get tired of being sick, see an hio method chiropractor.
gum in general is good for you, because it stimulate your salivary glands to secrete more saliva, saliva is good for your teeth because it helps neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria after your eat and also it provides minerals that are important it tooth repair. sugar in the gum gets rid of all the benefits obtained from gum therefore sugar free gum is better for your teeth
Extra
Sugar isn't good for your teeth. It isn't like you are chewing and swallowing.
Don't doubt yourself asking which one. Believe in yourself and realize you can have both.
I am currently in therapy. However, my therapist found out that I have a hard time opening up to people and therefore doesn't know how to help me and decreased the time that I see her I honestly don't have any interests right now. My depression caused me to lose motivation and I just don't do anything. I do love my horses and being outside though.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
You could do what I am doing by finding out who you are really by enjoying the smallest of things in life and you hold on to those things that make you happy inside.
Yeah, what do you enjoy doing? What's your passion? What are you good at?
Yes, go to therapy for the depression. No one can define you, but therapy can remove obstacles for defining yourself.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
I was diagnosed with chlamydia 2 weeks ago and placed on antibiotics medication for 1 week. I took my tablets as told and didn't engage in any sexual intercourse. However, as soon I finished my treatment, I had unprotected sex the very next day with a new partner. If my new partner is clean, can she test positive for the STD even if I'm cured since it takes up to 6 weeks for the dead bacteria to leave your body ??
No single course of treatment is guaranteed to completely cure an STI. You need to get the all clear from a doctor before resuming sex as otherwise you could pass the disease on to a partner - in which case you could be held legally liable for GBH if they caught it. Having one contracted a sexually transmitted infection, you are an absolute idiot to have further unprotected sex, however clean your partner appears to be.
Well might wait and get the all clear first from the doctor.
better to check doctor and verify it has gone
I am a 16 year old girl and I am 5'6 and I really want to grow tall. My sisters are so tall and elegant and the there is tiny me. I guess it's kind of funny since I am the youngest lol. However, I really want to be taller more than anything. Please tell me there's a way. I want to be ideally be 5'9 or 5'10
5ft 6 is already slightly over average height. You stop growing 2-3 years after your first period. No way can you grow 3-4 inches, sorry.
Can't. Total imagination
Nothing. You've stopped. Nothing you can do. Don't believe anyone who says you can still grow or buy fraudulent snake oil.
You are still very young and you are probably not done growing considering your sisters are taller than you.
You can't.
Drink water and eat small amounts of fruit spread out every 30-60mins and take a nap. Works for me!
Bring an apple. Have that. It makes me hungry as well. The only way I benefit is noit to eat afterwards.
Also drinking water doesn't help me at all plus just makes me have to wake up to use the restroom a ton
Work out in the evenings.So then you get tired and just go to bed.:/
Okay, so I have all the signs of a first period coming soon (if I don't already have it), including discharge. I've been getting discharge for quite a while now and today while I was at a friend's house, I used the bathroom and noticed a faint reddish-orangish stain on my underwear. It was very faint and I don't know if it was my first period or not. I am very scared; please help!!!!!
What are you scared of? Periods are 100% normal, if anything you should be annoyed, haha. Just check yourself ever so often, and if you have been having 'signs' then it probably is it. Talk to an older woman that you are close to about it, and welcome to one of the most annoying parts about being a girl, haha.
Could be a bladder infection so see a doctor.
i got my period yesterday and that stuff happend to me your gonna get it ahhhh
You're on the blob,its not the end of the fùcking world.
Yes
Dr Travis Stork mentions a flourless wrap in his diet cookbook. I haven't seen it. I use a romaine lettuce leaf. I don't care for the taste of whole wheat.
Whole wheat contains fibre and does not give you such a sharp rise in blood sugar . So yes , they have an upside . Eat them and get used to them .
yes
Better then the cardboard kind.....
Yes, it is extremely normal to get an erection. They happen at all sorts of times, places, and moments.
It is quite normal to get erection for teenagers any time . Even with a slight sexual feeling you will get boners. Enjoy. Regards.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme works good and I like how long it last.The results are great I can preform for hours and go multiple time without breaking a sweat or feeling tired it really get the job done this stuff is great.
Yes of course it is. A natural one when you aren't even turned on is also normal.
Quite normal. Animal characteristic for most mammals and even birds and many insects. Even some fish have penises.
yes it is normal
Yes.
Is it normal to get hungry? healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
yes, especially if you are between 12 and 25....raging hormones.
perfectly normal, i'd worry if you did'nt.
Well if you are thinking concussion, probably 48-72 hours, but that depends on how hard you hit your head and the object you hit it off of. I would consult a doctor or health professional and get it checked just to be on the safe side, better safe than sorry!! Good luck and all the best!
37 years 33 1/2 minutes and 18 seconds.
Need to stay awake for at least 4-6 hours and be observed by someone. If severe injury or you were unconscious, go to an ER.
a concussion never goes away and can stick with you the rest of your life
If you have a concussion, it can be months.
nothing to worry about ,this is natural for the first time .the pain will go away in few hours and it is not bad pain. The same goes for the female. You should use some lube as u had dry penis and also u partner did not use lube. so next time use plenty of lube and it will be all fine.
Paraphimosis is the name of this condition. Get penis flaccid = use icebag or cold water. Using baby oil (or similar) squeeze glans with finger/thumb and wriggle foreskin forward to normal position. Use a lube next time. < M
Your foreskin needs to be fully retracted for proper sexual pleasure. However, it is usual for it to return to covering the glans as your erection subsides. If you cannot easily get it back to covering your glans then you may be suffering from paraphimosis. In that case you need to see a doctor quickly as paraphimosis ca cut off the blood supply to the glans. In the long term you may need to be circumcised to relieve the underlying phimosis and permanently prevent future bouts of paraphimosis.
Go to a doctor ASAP.
tuck it up where it was before, you jerk!
I'm about 6 inches and a quarter when erect! So maybe you guys could give me your size when and when not erect, I'm just looking to see if I'm an okay size! Also another question, when my girlfriend gives me a blow*** I only last about 2 minutes, so is there any practice I can do alone to be able to last longer? Thanks so much
That's average size for the average male. And since boys reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16, you know you're there.
I was the about the same size at sixteen, pretty normal size dick, you could actually jack off more an try the edging method to help control when you bust a load
Adult size is reached around 15. Average adult size is 5.16 inches. So well hung. As to lasting longer, ejaculate a couple hours before she services you and that should make it last longer.
They have also helped me stay playing with the girls for a longer period. I have understood from my previous experiences that if a guy finishes off quickly, the girl never gets satisfied and still needs something more. Prolargentsize has helped me end that desire and completely exhaust a girl to her end.
You do no need to see a doctor for missing a few hours sleep. LMAO "I've never been the addictive type." You are 13 yrs old and talk like a 9 year old. I highly doubt you have any real insight into addiction. Give your Mom a break and suck it up like all the other people in the world do. I sleep every other night. New parents hardly ever sleep. Doctor's are lucky to get sleep. Some people work 2, 3 jobs. So many people get 4 hours a night and still function without being whiny. Toughen up kid.
Melatonin is a non-addicting sleep aid that is generally produced in the brain, yet melatonin can also be reduced by exposure to light (such as from electronics; 'blue light' filters or amber/safety glasses help prevent this). Melatonin is important also because it is a very potent antioxidant. Melatonin is a derivative of serotonin, which relies on vitamin D, thus insufficient levels &or exposure to sunlight may impair its synthesis. Supplementation should consider dosage, w/ the lower dosages (500mcg-1mg) being preferable unless more is required.
i have the same problem i go to be at like 8 in the morning! my dad thinks its cause electronics but its hard for someone else to understand. Try to talk to your mom about the situation. also there are things you can do such as breathing certain ways changing the temperature of the room and etc. Try doing the 4-7-8 trick. Breath in for 4 seconds hold that breath 7 seconds and let out for 8 seconds. Its currently 3:30 and im up doing school, smh.
Unless over the counter pills your aunt is doing anything legal. Your activity, caffeine (chocolate intake) vitamins, all makes a huge difference. You need to see a physician.
go lay in bed without computer phone or tv. just lay and close eyes
i sleep everyday
You're not stupid. I think only mean angry people are stupid. Anyway, although it's a short question, you managed not to make any spelling errors, therefore you're spelling is okay. So that's a start.
Because 1) You are insulting yourself and focusing on the negatives and 2) You are not changing it, if you don't want to be stupid read more and learn instead of complaining, because complaining wont change anything.
You aren't stupid karl. Its just that you don't listen when people try to teach you things so you don't learn new information. You're actually just ignorant.
Yeah.
That is a really good question, could it be genetics or did you do it all by yourself?
No, you're just different.
you're pretty awesome!
Put a hose up there and turn the water on. It'll start expanding like a balloon. Guess what happens when he leaves the hose in for too long........
Internet is full of guys masturbating, he just needs to explore the seedy world of the internet for ideas.
enlist a partner, male or female / your choice
You are such a lame troll... SMH
I found death record of my great grandmother and everything matches. Her full name, birth date, birth place, and death age is basically close. Now what doesn't match is her last name was Garcia Torres and I know her mother's name was Garcia Nieves and on the death record the father is Garcia and her mother is Torres....so could that mean the names are mix up? And also my great grandmother died in her early 40s and on the record it shows mid 40s (46). So do I take this record or no? She's the only person with this name that died in her country and was in the 40s and had a mother name Maria
It's a high possibility. Sometimes they go by a different name. Maybe their "legal name" is one they adopted a long time ago over what is true? Ask your parents. It sounds interesting : )
No, it means that americans don;t understand how surnames work in Mexico... they (we) always mess them up... even on official records.
Without a link and a name, no one can tell.
If, as is most common, the showers are in an open area so all can see one another then it is very bad manners to masturbate there - and may even get you expelled from the gym. However, if you have a private shower stall you can do so if you wish, just as you might at home.
Would never use a Gym or Pubic shower... Or use changing rooms. But if I did I would... sometimes I masturbate in the shower... but not often.
I don't remember since I haven't masturbated in 4 or 5 years lol
No, never had the urge. At my Y I used to go to, the changing rooms and showers were all open so no privacy to do that.
No. But I have in a Movie theater Bathroom stall. Just couldn't help myself.
If I knew other guys were in there doing it id do it lol
i think at one time we have all did it
So last night around 830 I got this headache on my left side of my head and behind my left eye. I took painkillers then went to sleep but in the middle of the night I got up because the headache was still there and I still have it kinda and when I move my left eye it hurts like last night and I'm also feeling kinda tired. So I just wanted to know is this a regular headache or aneurism and also what should I do about it? 19 male healthy no health issues
First off stop self diagnosing on the internet! My dad is a trauma surgeon, but also helps in urgent care and he said that he gets at least 10 people a day who are convinced that they have like deadly cancer when it's only the flu. Moral of the story- chill out it is probably just a migraine. Give it 3 days, drink a ton of water and if it's not gone go to the doctor. But when you go don't walk in their and announce you have a brain aneurysm- no offense but they may look at you like an idiot. I'm not saying that you 100% don't have one, but also don't psych yourself out! Feel better!!
I suffer from migraines and cluster headaches . I was told to take a muscle relaxer when I feel like the headache is on one side of my head , eye and neck . It has helped . Hope that helps .
If that was an aneurysm, you'd already be dead. You have a headache. Take advil or aleve along with a dose of caffeine (coffee, tea, or soda).
Did you start taking any sort of anti-depressants/anti-anxiety meds? If so they do hinder your want for food . Just eat little bits everyday.
Go to the doctor
As a woman, in my opinion, sex is more enjoyable for the woman than the man. Men enjoy sex, sure, but we love it more. A woman who doesn't enjoy sex has a partner who doesn't know how to please her or simply doesn't care. And assuming her partner is male, he isn't much of a man if he doesn't care about her pleasure.
let me guess, this is Nicole again right? women are capable of multiple orgasms. we have no refractory period like men. men orgasm and they are done. we can orgasm limitless times also as far as it serving no purpose (aside from the pleasure) when a woman orgasms her contractions cause the cervix to scoop up sperm, so yes it does matter
What in the world makes you think that intercourse is not pleasurable or orgasm-making for a female? If you think that "Anonymous", we know one thing for sure -- you're not a female.
Well its pleasurable for the man and thats all that really matters. Womens orgasms serve no purpose but mens orgasms make babies.
ehhh that is not even possible! like who said that if he had some type of infection and he kissed you in the lips hen your more likely to be sick. but no he kissed you in the cheeks so your perfectly fine don't need to worry about it.
not necessary but most of the infections spread when you come in contact with subject under 1 meter.. and it depends how your immune system is... you may get sick but well even if u get sick itll be worth caz u got the kiss ;)
Maybe, maybe not. Depends on the type of illness and how it's transmitted.
Not likely. It is possible but you should be fine
TECHNICALLY you can ask them not to? However, is that a good Idea? Absolutely not. A huge number of things can be effected by Weight; Medication dosage, Blood chemistry, normal ranges, etc etc. Without a weight, accurate calculations are next to impossible.
You can ask but you are short changing yourself if you avoid addressing your weight. Also if the doctor needs to prescribe any meds, they need to know your weight to help determine the dose.
The reality is that they do this to help with discussing possible medical issues that could arise from being overweight or underweight. A Dr. needs to make a record of your weight for medical reasons suck it up.
Are you really that vain? It's not like the doctor is going to judge you. If your weight is unhealthy, he'll tell you. That is not judgment however. That is the doctor's job.
Forget it. The doctor needs to know.

What's a tity bone?
Yeh i broke mine
no since there is no such thing you can not break what doesn't exist
your breasts don't have bones. the bones under the breast are your ribs, but i think you'd know if you broke a rib.
No such thing stupid troll
Im 13 years old I have asked a question similar to this but I think I was miss understood. Anyway I'm not talking about stop precumming for good I'm just talking about in the morning. Everyday I st in the shower and when I get out I have this erg to pee. And when I pee clear slinmy stuff comes out (precum) I just want to know how to stop precuming in the morning I wake up at 6:20 every morning and it's very annoying seeing precum come out of my penis every time I get out the shower
Must be getting aroused in the shower and some guys just produce a lot more precum than other guys. If you are not ejaculating when you go to bed, try that and see if that helps reduce the precum.
That is normal. I do that all the time, when changing my underpants, I see precum stains. No need to worry man thats normal stuff:-)
Puberty. Normal
You're 13. Hormones are going crazy. Your penis is going to act without conscious effort for a year or two or three. That includes unwanted sexual arousal. There isn't anything that you can do to prevent it, but it will go away on its own over time.
Its because of puberty and at this stage you have little control of your body. Some guys produce alot more of precvm and some doesnt. You had been arroused while your asleep and you cant control having it for now.
Well for guys you either do pre or you don't. You really can't control it other than masturbating and not getting excited again.
It takes some time to control your orgasm, but it takes a couple or alot of practice since ejaculation is unstoppable... Youll see result one's you manage to stop your orgasm and last longer.
Well it takes some time edging before you really get the hang of it. In time however you will be able to control your orgasm and last longer at masturbation and sex.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme did exactly what I needed it for and will definitely recommend it to friends.
An addiction to playing video games is purely psychological. One gets past it the same way one gets past other psychological addictions like marijuana and social media: One either stops on their own free will or one gets psychological help, like a support group or therapy. To 'kick' gaming, it is rather easy in comparison to using THC, but very similar. What one does is create an absence of such stimuli. Unplug. Get outside. Join a sports team or other group activity. Retire the mouse for two weeks and see what happens.
You have a choice...either PULL the PLUG completely...or allow someone ELSE to control the use. Computers are useful for other things...you can't get away from them. If you have a router with administrative options...you could tell someone to TURN OFF THE ACCESS to the internet for certain periods of time. You need to TELL someone ELSE around you ... not a bunch of strangers.
why stop doing what you love doing and look into getting a job as a game tester
Once you enter, you can't go back. However,if you really want to stop, sell all your devices on ebay
One of my friends is having a really hard time improve his muscle growth and is considering taking Six Star Booster but only half a pill in the morning and night instead of 2 like recommended, should he be fine? He is only going to take it for about a month to get started and eventually get off of it if he decides to do it.
At age 16 it will do absolutely nothing. A 16 your boy is already at the peak of his testosterone production. All a testosterone booster does is help release what is called "free testosterone" which is stored in the body and never used. This only applies to aging men who are no longer young and virile. For a teenage boy it won't do anything at all. Remember... a testosterone booster is NOT testosterone! It is simply a blend of herbs and vitamins that help men who are getting up in age free up the testosterone in their body already produces.
Doubt it will do anything, no over the counter testosterone boosters have been proven to have any effect on testosterone production.
Probably nothing. It is a complex of herbs and chemicals of very questionable value for muscle growth. The term anticatabolic means it is supposed to prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue. He would be much better off using simple whey protein. Most of the muscle building products are for dedicated body builders and most of those offer very little improvement over a readily available protein powder. Note that these products come with labels like super this, ultra that or mega muscle builder. It is pure marketing for profit. Taking a protein supplement before and after a workout will be the most effective. That and exercising right using progressive resistance. The most important factor is to dedicate yourself to regular workouts.
Who would want to handle a black woman?
If she is willing to be my bodyguard and get all those darn animals out of my sexy trees so I can have privacy with them..then yes, I can.
I married one so ....I can handle her just fine.
i dont like black monkeys
Sounds like she would be the one doing the "handling". If you know what I mean...........
Is that code for fat?
Brief it out? Interesting saying. It depends on so much, he should really get an informed guesstimate. That means an oncologist. There are NO guarantees.
Caught early cancer is treatable, but it will ALWAYS come back eventually. It might take 20 years but it will come back.
I'm sorry to hear that but we are not doctors, just ordinary people. I'm sure his doctor would've told him what might happen.
Has it been confirmed by his doctor as they are the best ones to explain the outcome
Female sex organ. It can bring a man great pleasure, although the person attached to it often brings great misery. Unfortunately, when it comes to vagina, you have to take the bad with the good. As my father once said. "If they didn't have a wet hole between their legs there'd be a bounty out on all of them."
It's the place you come out of as a bay bay and spend the rest of your life trying to get back in as a man, lol.
It's that hole between a woman's legs that leads to the womb
It is derived from a Latin word for sheath or scabbard. -- Regards, John Popelish
well it is not a political. it refers to part of the female body https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina
It's part of the female genitals.
The question means you are a fool.
Regina means queen in Latin.
It means you are in the wrong section.
I lived in Ireland for awhile. According to them, you haven't had too much beer unless you can no longer hold on the the grass to keep from falling off the face of the earth.
More then 2.
More than one time a day is way too much.
Oxymoron
I do not know how much is too much. Despite many years of empirical research I have not been able to establish this. :-)
Any beer is too much, awful tasting stuff...
When you suddenly realize you're dancing over in the corner by yourself and your friends are acting like they don'know.you too much
Drinking more beer than your liver can process. It takes one hour for your liver to process one drink.
Slight or a good buzz is okay. Losing ones ability to manage his tongue and manners is not.
Bend over so that your head is in between your legs and kiss you butt goodbye. Your butt's not going anywhere, but it'll be a proxy for your brain. Youll be figuretively kissing your brain goodbye. Mountains of evidence and you chose to be an idiot. Go figure.
I probably wouldn't do it again? Partaking in meth can have serious consequences.
You should stop and go to the hospital before you become totally addicted to it. Trust me, meth will only ruin your life and nothing more.
please go and seek help, get rid of any u still may have, coming from an addict it is never as good as the first time and it will have serious consequences on your physical and especially your mental health, if you don't want to seek help for yourself do it for your family addiction isn't a single person disease it affect massively those around you
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
Solid Coconut oil. Rub it on and wash it off with a gentle facial cleanser. I suggest Purpose. It can be bought anywhere.

I am 14 years old and here is my problem : I dont know why but my tongue is white and at the very back of it i see very very small bumps whiter.i want to go to the doctor but parents say its nothing but im worried . I havent had sexual things or kissed anyone i wash my mouth and tongue but still remains there . Please help if you know anything about this or if you have had this too . Please be serious and sure on the answer. Thank you!
It could be a yeast infection. I would have a Dentist look at it. I'm serious and sure on my answer.
I'm in the dental field. I can tell you with confidence that the bumps of different sizes are taste buds. There's many different kinds on your tongue to taste different things. As for the white, depending on the thickness, it could be candida which is yeast (if it's thick). If it's thin it's likely to be plaque, which is dental bacteria. It builds up on teeth too. Purchase a tongue scraper or make sure to brush your tongue with your toothbrush. Also rinsing with a mouth rinse twice a day. Remember to change your toothbrush or head on a power brush every three months.
Yes
Don't worry this is normal
It could be thrush. Look that up online & compare pics to you. It is not a good thing as it is very contagious. You need to see a better doc & mention the word thrush to him/her.
Sounds like thrush. http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/d...
No it is normal
The average penis size for a 14 year old is 4 to 5 inches.
There is no average for your age as you are growing. The average penis size for adults is 4-6 inches. You will be growing until your 21 years old, so you have 7 years of growing to do.
The average erect penis size for 14 year old is around 4 inches.
About 4-5 inches. You're still growing, and your penis is too. It's not that big yet.
According to a study: 4.5inches (11.5cm) is the average for a 14 year old
Depends on how they have developed- most guys are in the 4-6 inch range, but then most guys reach full adult size by age 15. Average for adult males is 5.16 inches.
4 inches
1 inch
I think somwhere around 4 or 5 inches, if you are concerned dont be, you got years left to grow.
When erect, maybe about 5-6 inches. I'm not sure though.
Bench press is the best upper body compound movement. So the push up for body weight.
Push ups work out most of your upper body. Everywhere from shoulders, biceps, forearms, and pectorals.
Push ups, pull ups, lifting up a big, heavy rock over your head and side to side, etc. Get creative!
jogging
Complete retraction is not an automatic thing. You need give it a little help by pulingl it back. It will be pushed back during sex, so no problem.
Shouldn't have problems- though might be sensitive. If you can't slide it back fully when erect might try gradually stretching it somewhat.
see the doctor for some cream to help you out
your one problem is in your mind. your penis behaves very well
Thank you for sharing your story with us.
I'm 13, and its been 3 months since I've hhad my period. Since I was 11, I've been having it irregularly and its been 2years so it should be regular by now. My friends point out that they never see me eat, and I realized I only eat once a day. (a large snack, like 2 cinnamon rolls, three cans of sprite, popcorn and cookies.) Or else I skip breakfast, lunch and dinner. My mom is bringing to the doctor, and I'm afraid he's going to diagnosis me with ednos or something. I don't want land in the hospital because I heard about how it fucks up your life, so how do cam I fool the doctor?
Doctors can be easily fooled. When doctor asks you question, just lie. Most doctors typically just ignore what the patients say and rely on the tests, but there is no reliable tests to detect ednos. Having said that, I think you are fooling yourself. You should have your ednos treated properly before it becomes a much bigger problem later in your life.
Oh, for heaven's sakes -- you're not going to end up in the hospital! Even if you did, that doesn't sound so bad - I think it sounds rather restful. Nothing to do but lie there in bed and watch TV and have people bring you your meals and wait on you hand and foot. Sounds great! Just go to the doctor and tell him the same crap you just told us. smh...
Just be honest with your doctor, most likely it wont **** up your life.
Think of the happiest, most well balanced person (food-wise) that you know. Act like them.
I don't believe you.
"Im 5'8 130 pound male, 26 years old. am i too skinny?" You are at what is considered the bottom end of the healthy range. However actual bone structure also plays an important role in what is a healthy weight for the height. Someone who has a wide wrist, will be able to carry more weight better than someone with a narrow wrist will.
The ideal weight for your height and age is 148-153 lbs
For your height and age that does sound on the thinner side. Try googling a BMI calculator and it will tell you if you're underweight.
yaeh you way less then me to. and im 5 foot 3
Yes you weigh much less than me and I'm 5'0
guys like it. For most women, it is a painful experience.
Rubbing the prostate gland just adds to the pleasure of anal sex. It is still very pleasurable without it.
Actually the G spot can be indirectly stimulated during anal sex if the angle is right. .
Try lipotrim. It's developed by the Howard Research Foundtion - three milkshakes (if you are a woman) and two larger ones if you are a man. They are complete meal replacements. You struggle for the first week, go into ketosis and then manage well.
Work out everyday. Drink lots of water. Don't over eat/eat unhealthy meals.
1- Exercise daily, I don't recommend swimming because it builds to muscle and makes you heavier. 2-Stop eating bread, it is what puts the most weight on you. 3- Don't starve yourself, that doesn't help, just have the right mindset that you have to lose weight. Hope I helped
Eat these foods only... beef, hamburger (no bun), pork, hot dogs (no bun), chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, butter, nuts, green salad with a little dressing. Pick one day a week, the same day and eat other foods in moderation. When you get discouraged, ask your self "what do I hate worse, being fat or no carbs".
Get sick.

at least
not if its on your boyfriend
Usually a 10 minute break if you work 6 hours; lunch and a break or two if you work 8 or more. There is no law in the U.S. that says you get one (unless you are a union worker); but most employers do provide them.
Yes. At least 1 15 minute break for less than 5 hours or after 5 hours a half hour break.
They should get a 15 minute break, but some places have different rules. You usually have to work for 6 hours to get a 30 minute break.
In the UK it is a 20 minute break after 6 hours.
That depends on where you are. Some places one 15 minute, some places none.
2 15 min brakes is what I have
Many positions require it and won't take no for an answer. Just stick your hand in running water while you're trying to urinate.
Can you practice at home, until you get it right? There are times the doctor NEEDS to have this checked for various SERIOUS reasons.
Maybe they will give you a container that you can use at home and bring it in.
Get dirty yellow braces and when you smile tell people you are 93 years old. Get orange jumpsuit color braces and tell people you bit someone and your teeth are now in jail. Get brown braces with X's painted on each one and tell them you built a rail line to transport food from one end of your mouth to the other. Get them red and tell people your teeth are blossoming now. Get green and say your teeth are progressive and environmentally conscious. Make them multi colored and join the the all lives matter movement.
Navy Blue-> Works on males, females, makes teeth look whiter. Silver-> Less noticeable, doesn't fade colour. Red-> Sands out and is a nice colour. Hope this helps you! :)
Silver, it's the most discreet. Red makes your mouth look like it's bleeding and blue makes you look like you have something organic growing in your face. white goes yellow over time so silver looks the most natural.
poop colored!
Tell a parent or a teacher. People have committed suicide because of cyber bullying. Just 'avoiding the website' doesn't always help. That's the same as telling a kid at school who is being bullied to just avoid the area the kids go to. What is said has been said.
inasmuch as it's ''just '' about cyber bullying - you may- first- close your relevant account on the web- to begin with... inasmuch as bullying occurs in school also or in real life- some responsible adult there: school manager or counsellor or so - have to immediately be aware of what you're going through... as your parents/ closest available family- as well( have to be aware) informing the police may have to be considered as needed - and the bullying has to firmly be stopped once and for all...
change you accounts on every website and join funny accounts and pages and live your life. They are trying to hurt you by words. Words won't do **** if you interpret them the right way.
You don't go to those websites.

Most people I have seen who are fat go about it by eating less I have noticed and they seem to starve themselves of junk food and healthy food alike. But what if they ate just a lot more healthy food in general. What if instead of starving themselves. Gorged themselves in large healthy meals, and then after they have gorged themselves in a nutritional and high calorie meal did a ton of sprints, sit ups and push ups. Would this work more efficiently then if they ate less and did marathons?
Yes. Starving yourself will never help lose fat. When you starve yourself, your body goes into survival mode and actually burns fat as a last resort. In addition, starving yourself has many negative health effects such as vitamin deficiencies. Changing your diet to healthy food and exercising will always help you lose weight, even if it's a big portion. However, if you are looking to lose a lot of weight then portion control and calorie counting comes into play.
Not at all. Gorging on food and over exercising is not healthy. Also exercise only makes up about 15% of weight loss. Your theory doesn't work scientifically or realistically.

The pleasure providing part of the vulva is located in the clitoris and labia, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches in depth. The interior of the vagina has no more pleasure sensors that would an arm.
Because this is the physiology of the female .... we do have a g-spot inside our vagina. This is the Skenes Gland. You can g00gle it for more info.
Let the pet pooch lick your clit......thats stimulation
I think it has to do with all the nerve endings that are in the clitoris
Codone refers to the chemical component derived from codeine. Codeine is an opiate, a chemical derived from opium, just like heroin. Some people react to codeine as if it were a poison. It IS a poison. You and people like you are lucky.
"Codone" refers to the fact that it's made out of codeine. You could be allergic, which would make you very ill if you took it. When you have a response to medication like that you need to call your doctor ASAP.
It's the codeine component. Yes, it can make you nauseous or make you puke. If you need something else for pain, please call the doctor that gave it to you and report this side effect.
that's strange. Im the opposite. I get sick if i don't have them
You have got a chemical burn from the Nair you used on your pubic area. Don't EVER use that stuff down there - it's too caustic. Wash yourself with some clear water (don't use soap), and rub the area with some baby lotion. Don't use Vaseline; that will just "hold the burn in". That's about all you can do. Your skin will probably start peeling too.
Gently wash with cold water and a clean damp cloth. I find that when applying nair, cover your labia with something (plastic wrap maybe?) to stop the cream from touching it.
if god wanted bushless vaginas thats what they would be
aloe vera
sensitive skin down there, wash it off.
uhhhhhh...... dont look at me, that be a gurls problem :-3
I've had an on:off melanoma fear for a few months now. I thought I was over it. I noticed a few five years back I didn't have this one freckle on my arm. It was there 1-2 years ago. It's small, round, normal edges, brown. No changes. Just feel sick as I was sure I always had it. I know new freckles are common just need confirmation.
Freckles aren't melanoma.
Sounds like a harmless freckle. Show your Dr next time you visit, for reassurance.
Stop stressing about freckles, I have lots of them everywhere on my body and they fade during winter and multiply by the millions during summer and I could not tell you what ones are new or have been there forever and I am nearly 60 years old.
Like anything else, it depends on how MUCH you drink while you are taking anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication. Just a couple of beers spaced out over the entire day won't hurt you, but if you constantly sip, sip, sip all day, that's an entirely different story. That could be very dangerous when you are taking anti-anxiety medication. At the very least, excessive alcohol will negate any potential benefit of anti-anxiety medication, and you might as well be taking sugar cubes. Alcohol and anti-anxiety medication are just not compatible - alcohol "cancels out" anti-anxiety medication. Another thing to avoid if you are taking anti-anxiety or anti-depressant medication is grapefruit juice.
No , alcohol is also an anti depression agent though harmful to health in other way
I certainly wouldn't risk drink hard alcohol - beer in MODERATION might okay - I take anti-depressants and 2 beers with a meal doesn;t affect me
Read the leaflet that accompanied the medicine. It will say if alcohol should be avoided or not.
Talk to your doctor but usually not a good idea.
NO extremely dangerous!
Possibly GERD, definitely make an appointment to the doctors
You need immediate medical attention.
All your life? And your parents did nothing for years you had this problem?
Yes, you should see a doctor.
I don't think there is a possible way to change the colour of your eyes without contacts. I'm not even sure hollywood has something for that. I suggest you wear sunglasses if you can so people don't have to see your eyes at all. Overall, I don't think your teacher will care about the project to the extent you're eye colours need to be changed. That seems pretty ridiculous. So I think you will be fine with your eye colour.
That is really going over board to the point of being really silly. As if anyone cares what eye color you have compared to the character. probably 99% wouldn't know what eye color the character is supposed to have anyway. If group hypnosis was possible , that would be your only option to make everyone think they see a different color. The acting and the costume is what will sell your character...not the color of the eyes that no one can see from 10 feet away anyways.
I don't think it is possible to do that without colored contacts. You may damage your eyes if you try to put anything in them. The darker your clothes are, the darker your eye color will appear though. Best of luck
Give me your eyes, I'll give you mine. I have brown eyes. They are 20/20
No. Colored contacts are the only way.
sunglasses
You need will power.... Stop making excuses and do what you already know you need to do. It is that simple. Each time you do what you know you need to do it will re-enforce your determination and make the next time easier until it becomes a good and healthy habit. Everytime you act to break your diet, STOP and ask yourself if you want to be fat all of your life? Then just say, "NO",
Make bigger portions of healthy food and freeze it. Always have fruits at home for snacks. Why are you failing. Stress eating, depressed? Hungry all the time? I do not like diets. Cut down on McDonalds etc and eat more homecooked meals
Go on a diet and have some will power to stop eating too much.
learn how to read a nutrition label, ONLY EAT THE SERVING SIZE for everything, and dont eat more than one serving of anything in one day. stay away from any fructose or corn syrup, its really bad for you, and just keep exercise at a minimum. try to get like an hour of it a day and dont push yourself unless you're already used to your routine
Don't diet. Make permanent changes in how you eat, including what and how much.
Try to fart , farting burns a lot of calories , imagine only one fart will burn about 200 calories , try to fart 20 farts a day and you will lose all the fat , you will be losing about 10 pounds a week .
Any man who'd rather masturbate than have sex with a woman are either homosexual or are hiding something.
He probably masturbates too much and has gotten use to cumming from that. You should get rid of him if it bothers you that much.
he watches porn and wan king has taken over his desire for sex.....it will never be like it was
Yes. They are very good for you. So does oatmeal. So top a nice bowl of oatmeal with small cut up pieces of apple for a healthy breakfast.
Lowering cholesterol is not as simple as adding apples to your diet. Even though apples are a health food, they probably won't make much difference in cholesterol. There's advice at the link.
Yes
No , best for stomach and bones having vitamin C and Iron
All fruit and veggies are low in calories and fat, so all are good.
Of course you can lose weight without gaining muslce, I have lost 28lbs with healthy eating and basic exercise and I have certainly not gained any muscle and I am female and almost 60 years old. You will only gain muscle if you do a lot of exercise at the gym or weightlifting to build up your muscles, Good Luck
I've never really been into taking supplements for working out, but I'm moving to Miami so I knew I had to step up my game. I've been focusing more on my diet and workout regime all summer so I can measure up in the beach scene but needed an extra boost. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea was at a good price point & I really like the ingredients all natural. I definitely noticed an improvement in my energy during my workouts. I also felt the niacin flush a bit but not when I took it with food as recommended .
Yes, it is possible to lose weight without gaining muscle. However, exercise is what builds muscle, so if you run on a treadmill you could build a little muscle. Don't worry about it. That is a good thing.
If you gain muscle, you'll gain weight. Muscle weighs more than fat. It's okay to be 'overweight'; it's not okay to be overfat. You cannot 'burn' fat without muscle.
you will probably not get HUGE muscles - especially only using a treadmill - NOT wanting muscles is stupid. having muscle BURNS calories
Mabye you should put all that effort into learning to speak simple English correctly instead.
it's amazing how many people miss the point of a healthy diet.
well, you're probably young enough to be my son- to begin with... you've probably got to stay on psychiatric treatment and follow -up... by the way- social anxiety is readily and easily treatable... you must do your best to boost your self- esteem and self- confidence...to learn to love and respect yourself- along with respectin others...yeah... probably- your practicing some kind of outdoors sport- could help...
I think it will get better. You will make new friends I am sure.
Besides consulting a professionally qualified doctor and taking proper and regular treatment, supplement your efforts with some regular prayers. Pray at least for two minutes daily honestly and sincerely. Prayer does lot of wonders in life just like a miracle.
So I'm 15, about 5'2-3", and 148. I used to suffer from anorexia, but I have since recovered, but still have confidence issues. I feel like I'm too fat. I have an abnormally large chest (36E kill me), and always have. I also have wide hips and broad shoulders. And thighs. Oh Lord the thighs. Should I lose weight? My crush says I don't need to be but I think he's just being nice.
From one recovered anorexic to another, losing weight is the last thing you should be worried about. Your body is a gift-accepting and learning to love it are essential. You are NOT overweight; don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise-including yourself.
You are significantly overweight for your age and height. You need to face the facts. It's unhealthy and unattractive. Now, some guys do like big girls, nothing wrong with that, but it doesn't mean you're not a big girl. You are, and it would be better for your health and your self-confidence if you would lose at least 20-25 pounds. That would bring you more in line with the recommended weight for your age and height. All guys love big boobs, and you've got 'em, so you are blessed in that department. But at this point you're just big all over. If you lose 20-25 pounds and keep those massive hooters...you'll have to beat the guys off with a stick.

Hi! My bf of a year has just admitted to me that hes a full blown alcoholic. I knew he drank a lot, but not that bad. He has admitted to drinking about the equivalent of 17-20 drinks a day. He told me he wants help and wants to change so we started weaning down to avoid deadly alcohol withdraw symptoms. Now he has cravings and I dont know how to help with them. Am I over my head here? has anyone else dealt with a loved one battling addiction? thank you!
well i am a recovering alcoholic with 14 years sobriety and your boyfriend just took the first and biggest step too recovery by admitting that he has a drinking problem and if you want too help him you have to be there for moral support and understanding and let me tell you it's gonna be long and rough some days but you'll pull through it
It usually takes a long protracted battle before one quits. Professional help is a must. He may quit, but most likely, he will get back on again. Alchohol has a strong pyschological addiction. My recomendation is you get way the hell away from him. I have seen what alcholics do to theirselves, family, bf/gf, children, and friends. Just get away from him. I know you think I am being mean. However, I am thinking of your children.
He needs professional help. This is not a situation a girlfriend can handle.
You are in over his head. He needs professoinal help, and time in a rehab facility
If he's a rude, selfish, hypocritical, inconsiderate, overopinionated, condescending, stuck-up bad boy, dump him or reject him and tell other girls to avoid him!
Which one of the 200 type of cancer do you want to know about? Try the cancer websites
A sign of cancer is you asking if you have cancer on yahoo answers
https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736... Those have been recognized warning signs of the most common cancers for about the last 100 years.
A tumor. Almost everything else is so non-specific that it could be associated with plenty of other causes, most of them simple issues like the flu or an infection.
There are many, including a severe pain.
death
Means he has a pulse. Nothing else. Most guys can feel their pulse in their shaft. It is engorged with blood and so blood is flowing inside it a lot when erect.
it means he is alive and reaching orgasm and you aren't having sex with a dead body. and yes generally when something actually happens it tends to mean it is quite possible. even probable. if it was not possible it wouldn't happen
It means you are too young for sex. Grow up.
Yes this is quite possible and normal
means you have a sensitive pu ssy
wait you haven't got your first period yet? some girls get it around 11-16 you should probably see a doctor. you may have some hormone problems!
I know a couple of people who didn't get their first period until they were about eighteen. It is not typical though, so you might want to get it checked out. Also if you are not eating a healthy diet, or constantly trying to lose weight, that could delay your periods.
You should see your doctor.
4.8 inches In a study of penis size where measurements were taken in a laboratory setting, the average penis circumference when erect was 4.8 inches (12.3 cm), which means that the average width of the erect penis is approximately 1.5 inches (4 cm).
Adult male (15 and over for penis size) is 5.16 inches.
Man you guys are obsessed with penis here.
2 feet if you are a Giraffe & 8 feet for a sperm whale .
i tell my woman three inches to appear large
depends on your age and your body frame
Around 5 to 6 inches. Mine is 5.5!
6 inches. In 50 years it will be bellow 1 inch... (To make people feel happy). healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Erect about 6-8 inches. Anything longer may scare a female away. Before my prostate cancer I had 8 inches erect.
I recently got glasses for the first time. I have distance glasses but my vision is still pretty good. When I put on my glasses, my distance vision becomes terrible. It is very blurry. My near vision is still good though. When I mentioned this to my optometrist, he said I need to adjust to them. I have been wearing them for 30 mins and it hasn't got better at all. Will i adjust to them or was my prescription wrong?
It takes a while to get used to glasses, even when the prescription is right on. By the sound of things, your problem is with your reading (near stuff) glasses. They're not supposed to help you with things in the distance -- I've had reading glasses now for more than 25 years, but I don't need glasses for far things.
When I first got glasses it took me 2 days to really adjust. BUT the improvement was obvious in the first hour.
i wear glasses too(I can't see from far) and both the close objects and far away ones look perfect. I say talk to him/her again, and if they keep saying the same thing try and go to another specialist and see what they say. You don't want to hurt your eyes.
Your optometrist is useless. Get someone better. Yo may need multi-focals actually, or reading glasses only.
Yes you will, as a vagina stretches to fit that of a baby's head. You will be fine.
Your vagina is stretchy. It can stretch to let a baby out, so I'm sure a little penis will fit.
if you are old enough, when aroused, your vag gets wet and expands to accomodate most sizes of penii. he is obviously doing nothing to get you aroused
not many good sides to eating junk food. For instance, think about yourself as a house. If you use junk material, then your house won't hold up as well as a house with good quality material. It's the same with junk food and your body. However, the only time that I can see it being OK to eat junk food is if you're working out regularly and don't eat any junk food throughout the week, because then your body needs what's called a "Cheat Day".
Well there's if you want to gain weight, some people need sugar in there diet if there diabetic. As long as you brush your teeth and exercise and eating junk food you should be fine!
1) Companies who don't care about whether you live or die get to make lots of money off you. 2) You get fat and develop heart diseases and die at an early age helping to decrease the world population. 3) Some rich dentist get to be even richer off you to fix your teeth after tooth decay sets in. 4) Cancer researchers can use you for study when you develop cancer from consuming all the artificial chemicals in junk food. 5) You can donate your body to medical school after you die from heart disease and/or cancer so some medical students can dissect you.
it makes you feel good and you can even keep up your blood sugar and not get too skinny and it just makes things better
You don't gain any weight if you have a fast metabolism :)
makes you feel good
You'll never get old cause you'll die young!
They tend to make that sound when the man they're with has a much smaller dick than what would normally be considered small. It's a large effort on her part in order to make the man feel as though he's actually achieving anything within her, so that hopefully he will climax and/or lose interest so that she can get it over with.
What a rude question. No, if a woman (or man) is enjoying sex and making noises then their partner should take it as a compliment. If you find the noises annoying then do her a favor and break up with her so she can find someone who appreciates her more.
IT feel so good to them. When I have sex with my girl, she moans how good it feels and how big I am
Hi cans I get lice ants to Phil a she oh my pea knits? I need money fast
To make you think you're the man.
They want you to know that they are still alive and you did not harm them.
Because it feels good to them.
Amazingly, you are doing it wrong.
Don't get it twisted....!!
lol
You "feel" fat because you're a young teen who has spent her life being bombarded with airbrushed photos of women and told that you have to look like a meth-head to be beautiful. Being young and having no real life experience, you've been brainwashed to believe it. Now you have an eating disorder... You're 20lbs underweight. Get over it.
You are underweight. A 14 year old should be around 110-120. Do NOT starve your self, it will make it worse. You need to put on more pounds. You can eat good carbs such a avocados and cheese.
you are not fat if anything you sound underweight.
you are paranoid
The male orgasm is at best as it is, theres a sudden urge on your brain telling your hand not to stop at masturbating, theres a tingling sensation on your whole body and d!ck becomes really hard. Deep breathing. When you reach to a point of no return, well your body contracts and muscles in penis start to pump out those juice, but after those you feel like you wanted to take a rest and sleep... Really tiring but superb. Thats why its addictive.
Um.... you are old enough you should already know that. There's no possible way you can be a teen boy and not know what an orgasm feels like.
Awesome. It hurts sometimes but it feel great I bet male and female orgasm feels Simalar I'm so way or another
It's a great feeling when your penis becomes erect, and you ejaculate semen.
You will poop liquefied poop instead. I suggest you turn to gas so that you won't have to worry about pooping.
No, you will still go number 2.
I'm sorry but you won't. You may just have diarrhoea.
No.

I am only 13 so I not too sure about the facts but here's my opinion I think you can. Everyone goes through things and anxiety and depression can be controlled. Therapy and medication are great starters but if there's a real problem causing your depression and anxiety I would work on fixing it, weather it's a bad relationship or environment. As long as you feel that your able to I believe you can. Hope this helps
All Humans have anxiety and depression to some degree , my psychologist has anxiety , you will be a better teacher once you reduce it , as an Evolutional Goodhist I use modified mindfulness practices.
Definitely. It also depends on what level you plan on teaching. If it's little kids, it would probably be a little easier than smart-mouth teenagers who don't like to obey rules. You could do whatever career with those things as long as you can cope and control it fairly easily.
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. I suggest you suggest that the person get medically treated so they feel better. Here is an online link to st johns wort http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st_price-... Also some teachers are rare, some have slight surpluses. then you get a person who might think it is their duty to teach because others might go untaught it they let their confusion impede them. almost any human mathematics teacher is better than going without learning mathematics.
nope
Age, overall health, type of cancer, stage, previous treatments.
The cancer cure rate is higher in Germany where where treatments aren't limited to drugs and surgery alone. In Germany they'll use Curcumin which kills cancer cells without harming good cells, but they can't use it in the U.S. because here the drug companies control medicine and doctors here are only allowed to use drugs and surgery.
Type and stage of disease, age and other health issues of patient, patient preferences, insurance coverage.
Stage of the disease.
Im a 16 year old girl and i started going to the gym and lifting about two months ago. I have been focusing on my legs and i have already seen nice results in muscle mass. I am also on a macros diet. But the thing is im going for a vacation in the summer to our summer house for like 1 and a half month, and it is locates by the beach and isnt close to any gym or shopping centre. How can i maintain my muscle progression without a gym and weights? Will it work if i just do leg exercises with body weight?
Kind of sounds like you were drugged but it is hard to say. Did you have unusual "hangover symptoms"?
Sure sounds like it as GHB and such takes a while to remember anything. i.e. Andrew Luster.
I doubt it. Who knows maybe you had more than 3 shots and you just can't remember it.
No, it was the alcohol.
well duh .. u drugged
Psychiatric Ward, there are several types, ranging from Intensive Care Units (ICU), to Acute or Rehabilitation Wards, depending on how ill the patients are and the degree of security necessary for their effective care. They are usually in a dedicated unit within a hospital, or in a stand-alone psychiatric hospital and are usually classified according to the age group of people being treated ie Children and Adolescent, Adult, or Older Adult.
A special set of rooms in a hospital where the keep patients who are mentally ill -- often those who attempted suicide.
psychiatric ward in a psychiatric hospital, not a general hospital
A home for mentally ill people or suicidal people.
it's a place where they put people with mental problems
there is help out there. can you not go to a doctor or find a therapist/counsellor?? there are some free mental health services if you just look them up and make an appointment. call a hotline and they can let you know of some services around your area. finding help this way rather than an attempt to kill yourself is much more appropriate. please don't try a suicide attempt. sometimes killing yourself can lead to worse. there are so many ignorant people in this world and some people just don't get it, they don't understand and so they misjudge others. you may regret it... i hope things go well for you <3 dont hurt yourself!
First of all, realize that there is so much to live for. Suicide is seen as very selfish because you get rid of your pain BUT you cause pain to so many other people. Call this number please 1-800-273-TALK I really hope and pray for you. I hope that everything gets better, it always does in the end. :) <3
You don't have to actually try, just saying you attempted it is enough. Steal the car keys, get a hose and put it near the car. Tell them you tried carbon monoxide poisoning but the hose fell out the window and you didn't die.
Tie a scarf around your neck and pretend to lie there dead. Then when they find out, you can wake up.
That is a bad idea
I haven't had my period in 7 months. I'm not pregnant I'm still virgin, I don't have bad eating habits, I'm not overweight and I'm not skinny like a stick either. I'm not unhappy about it, I just want to know if it's normal to have it twice after the first time and then not get it at all. It's weird, but I'm happy to not have it so I didn't tell anyone because I don't want a panic. Why did it stop?
Sorry - not a woman, but I am a doctor. It is normal for young women to have irregular periods during the first year or so after they start. Seven months is a long time, though - if you can speak to a parent about this it would be good to get some tests at the doctor's to check a few things - a low iron level or a low thyroid level can cause this. This will involve blood tests and maybe urine tests - the doctor will not have to examine your private parts. And yes, the doctor will do a pregnancy test - even if you were a nun they would do a pregnancy test!
It's unusual but not dangerous. If you go to a dyno doctor, they'd probably advise low dose birth control to get your period regulated.
So I really wanna impress a boy, but I don t have a desirable enough body. I am 5ft 4 inches and 145 pounds! (Btw im 13). I live near a rugby pitch and have decided to run laps for 30 minutes a day, along with a few home exercises. I really wanna lose it quickly so I am only eating 3 small meals a day. (Mostly fruit, veg and protein) so how long will it take me to lose the weight?
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing and by far the most effective pre work out supplement I've ever tried. It gives me a ton of energy to do a challenging work out and I feel uplifted for the rest of the day. I never feel discomfort or dizziness due to the caffeine levels and it relieves bloating. Great balance of ingredients .
I'll relate. I'm 5ft 4 also and 125. Depending on what you do, you will lose faster/slower. I was 140 probably a month, month and a half ago. Stay active, run, Power90/P90X works very well and you can probably get them on eBay because it's older. Don't try FAD diets, you'll gain the weight right back.
4-6 months if you stick to a 1000 calorie diet and increase you exercise by 1 hour per day 7 days per week
A few weeks I would guess working out and dieting would make your lose it faster.
At the age of 13 you are still growing you know this right?
A person cannot really increase the size of their penis. But you have nothing to worry about. Your penis at 5.5 inches is perfectly within the average range and size and a very good size.
This is small , no way to increase size but operation which is risky . Try to be strong to make good ur deficiency
you could do it a number of ways. tying a small but heavy chain to it and stand with it on for three hours straight and keep it on for a week, dont remove it not even for showering or sleeping. you could inject steroids into your testicles you could tie a string to it tightly, throw one end out of a elevator with something big on the other end of it and press "up" or you could move to Asia and people there will think it's a monstercock
Yeah this is perfectly shaggable. Just go use it. Unless you seek a career in porn, anything much bigger is a liability. < M
Wow, I expected you to be chunky, but no, you look good. A picture of your stomach without clothing would give a better answer, but definitely with clothes on there's nothing wrong with how you look.
Did Spammy find some new pics? Edit - I believe you are not the troll I'm hunting. The girl in the pic is gorgeous
Yowza
I would not call you chunky. You're looking good.
Who cares, a young voice on an adult female is pretty attractive for some people.
Unfortunately not. You have already been through puberty and your vocal chords have matured.
If your 20 now, then there it is highly unlikely that your voice will get lower. sorry if this disappoints you :(

When the time comes that you are having sex with another person, you will lubricate like Old Faithful. Masturbatory arousal isn't the same as sex.
you are doing this all wrong. You should not be putting your fingers into your vagina, rather you should be rubbing your clitoris gently in small circles until you orgasm.Women do not orgasm by vaginal penetration, we orgasm by clitoral stimulation
Let the pet pooch lick your clitoris
HAVE SEX ASAP
Like sugar, my girlfriend told me too. Tastes like milk, much more creamy, with sugar.
Steak
It usually has a bittersweet taste to it. Also a little salty.
Sounds like crazy but i taste mine, its warm and sweet-salty kind of mixture, its creamy and sticky. Ask me anything.
Hi there. Maybe it would be a good idea to visit a neurologist? There are so manythings that can cause that. Are you getting your eight hours of sleep each night? Also, i have several food allergies and when i eat an allergen it effects my thinking. Also, exercise increasesthe blood flow to all parts of your body (including the brain), so it's important to exercise regularly. Low vitamin D or B 12 can cause tiredness. Just some thoughts. It can be a number of things, so a doctor night be able to help you.
Please go for a three months Refresher Course in any tutorial college in your town. They will refresh your mind and recharge your brain. The fees are moderate and the timings are flexible in tutorial colleges. Besides take some energetic food and drinks daily, so that you are able to concentrate your mind retain memory for a long time. The main idea here is that you should always maintain perfect mental health conditions to avoid such pitfalls in life.
It could be because your ulltraaaa stressed. Take spare time and do calming things like yoga or take a hot bath with music and just in general start being a more chilled out person x
Liquid Silk is the best by far. You have to go to the sex shop to buy it and it costs a bit more but it's the most natural feeling product by far. KY is nasty, I agree with you.
I prefer astroglide...it seems like it lasts a bit longer
I like Astroglide better.
coconut oil, fr.
KY, sorry.
I think there is really no proper way way on how to eat the banana. For me it's simple. Just peel the banana and eat it.
Find a nice ripe slightly spotted banana peel and consume no wrong or right way to eat on just not the peel. Green bananas yuck.
Monkeys do not peel bananas like this. ... Step 1: locating the top! Make sure to find the end of the banana opposite from the stem. Step 2: Pinching the top off. This is where you will be starting to open up the banana without bruising or mashing it. ... Step 3: Peel it back. ... Step 4: Peel back the other parts. ... Step 5: Enjoy!
The right way to eat a banana, is to peel it and eat it.
1.first take a banana into your hand 2.peel it upto half 3.now put the peeled part into your mouth and eat 4.next peel the other half and eat the remaining hence you ate your banana precautions: 1. Dont try to eat the banana peel . hope it helps Cheerio!
One medium banana provides only one gram of protein , a little more than 100 calories , 0.5 grams of fat and 27 grams of carbohydrates . Three of these grams are fiber . Bananas also contain an amount of folic acid , beta carotene, vitamin B6 , C, and K , thiamine, niacin , riboflavin, and lutein. Two a day would be plenty. Why? Eating too many at one time can flood your system with potassium, which is a good thing only in small doses. You can also get headaches, and sleepiness because they trigger the production of serotonin because of their tryptophan content (amino acid)
Step 1: Put the unpeeled banana in your mouth, with the stem of the banana sticking out of your mouth (if you're a newbie to things poking against your uvula, GET USED TO IT) Step 2: Bite hard onto the end of the banana. Step 3: Keeping your teeth in the down biting position, begin to pull the banana out of your mouth Step 4: Eventually you should have an empty peel in your hand, and a mouth full of banana. Step 5: Depending on if you're a left wing liberal or global warming denying republican, you can choose to use the peel for fertilizing purposes or add it to the trash piles next to the projects in your city.
Peel the banana then eat.
There are a number of ways to eat banana. One of the best ways include: 1st: locating the top 2nd: Pinching the top off. 3rd: Peel it back. 4th: Peel back the other parts. ... 5th: Enjoy!
There's no need to train your abs specifically. Whether you can or not depends on too many factors anyone on a forum can tell you. "Stronglifts 5×5" trains your abs as much as you need to, while training everything else. Stronglifts.com - follow the program & DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING & DON'T ADD ANYTHING. This routine will work best until you can deadlift at least 1.5×BW (bodyweight).
Every other. All muscles need rest between training sessions.
no, you need a well balanced workout. and in 2 weeks you will not get six pack
Fix your diet and cardiovascular will cut that gut, not sit ups.
The only way is injections of growth hormone. Daily. Before you stop significant growth.
You will only get as tall as your skeletal system will allow. Make sure you eat foods for healthy bone growth.
Growing up does it, here
No.
I have mild bipolar disorder and I was wondering if anyone can recommend an over the counter drug, supplement or seep aid for a mild manic episode. I used to take rx antipsycotics, but we decided to discontinue them because it completely flattend out my mood. Typically, my symptoms are only debilitating for a week or so out of the year anyway. But my recent episode has made me unable to sleep for about 5 days now so it s starting to get bad. If it continues for much longer I will go to a doctor, but in the mean time any advice is appreciated.
Yes. We will discuss threadbare about your other problems after you consult the doctor. As a first aid, start taking proper and regular treatment. It is a good attempt which I appreciate.
I suggest seeing a physician rather than asking us. also technically if you have been awake naturally for 120 hours it is possible you wont think our words mean what we think they mean.
Magnesium supplements work better then prescribed meds without the side effects. https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evo...
So my dad had a Massive Heart Attack back in December, and we've adjusted around his diet and what he needs. Now, we've found out he's a Type 2 Diabetic. He's seen a nutritionist, but they've given him the basics. Any recipes people enjoy that might be in the same predicament? He's getting upset with only eating veggies and veggies:/
He definitely doesn't need to be eating only veggies. Google Mediterranean diet recipes - this group of foods is great for both problems. It will also give you an idea of the array of foods that are appropriate, and you can use these foods with other recipes.
Lean Meats, Fish, Fruit, Eggs, Etc. There are many things he can eat. He should have his dietician give him a list of all the food he can eat, he doesn't have to eat "Just veggies"
whats wrong with chicken and fish, pork, whole grain bread and pasta? - after 5 months he should be able to eat a lot more than just veggies
It is normal, it happened to me as well. First they open useless gaps then they close them etc, it's a normal part of the shifting. If you're very worried, feel free to contact your orthodontist but what you're experiencing is what we all have experienced. It's normal.
This happened to me when I had braces. It's normal , they have to shift certain teeth in order to be able to straighten others.
If you just got braces this morning I doubt your teeth have moved much yet.
Yes it is normal..it'll go before your braces are taken out..
They are rearranging your teeth so there may be a little gap but it will close up eventually as your teeth become straighter
Seek a doctor immediately!
you should get yourself straight with God... please get yourself some Jesus.
Prolargentsize gave me the stamina and longer penis size I need to go longer. I feel more confident in my self now.
You are just well-endowed with a big penis is all.
Because you re one of Mother Nature s chosen ones .

You mad n1gga?
ALSO WHEN IT BIT ME I DIDN'T PROVOKE IT. IT THINKS IT'S BETTER THAN ME. IT PEES ON MY BED, SLEEPS ON IT AND BITES MY TOES IF I TRY TO GET IT OFF. NEVER LISTENS TO ME. AND TODAY WHEN IT BIT MY LEG SO ******* HARD, IT ACTUALLY HUGGED MY LEG WITH ITS TEETH STUCK INTO MY LEG. I HAD TO KICK IT OFF. THAT DISGUSTING CRAP. NEXT TIME IT BITES ME I'LL THROW IT OFF THE BALCONY.
You're a psycho. Kill yourself.
I hope you die of cancer because you're a sick, cruel and evil person. The dog bites because you are provoking it and DON'T FUKCING LIE that you're not. Your family would be better off if you did leave home, permanently, because you are worthless.
Last weekend, which was May 7 (today the 15th) I smoked marijuana for the first time. And I hated it. I hit it like 4-5 times and no more after that. Since this was my first time, how long will it take to get out of my system? I have an interview this upcoming Wednesday and I was wondering if I could pass a drug screen.
4-5 hits sounds like a lot for your first time, lol. Well it can last up to a month. But you can find a detox drink usually at a smoke shop that should help a lot.
30 days
30 days at most. That's usually only in heavy users. It should be out of you're system in probably 2-3 weeks.
Build a bridge
move on with your life and get a new girlfriend
Ethan?
Understand she is nothing special and find another to have sex with
Killing yourself would do it. Sounds to me like you figured it out.
Move on, don't kill yourself over losing her ~Aizen
that's why you pee /after/... the pre and the semen both are produced during sex so what good would it do to flush it out before?? regardless of what you do before, when u come u come...... semen isn't just sitting in ur urethra to get pushed out during sex, otherwise you'd come whenever u pee??? if u didn't use a condom and u came inside, then yes there is a chance
I feel sorry for your lady friend.....you really need to spend lots of time on her before you get anywhere close to the wet spot.....you need to practice delaying your orgasm.....so, if you didn't shoot sperm, it's not likely you will be a father....nor invited back for a repeat performance....
You're probably fine. Withdrawal isn't a *good* form of birth control but it's far from worthless.
You are still believing horsesh*t. "It has been suggested that any sperm in the pre-ejaculatory fluid must be the result of a previous ejaculation and that men who practice withdrawal should pass urine prior to coitus in order to wash away any residual sperm . However, in all cases in which we observed sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid the urethra had, of course, been washed with urine on multiple occasions after the last ejaculation, and therefore the contamination of pre-ejaculatory fluid must have taken place immediately prior to ejaculation."
As long as you didn't go off when you were in her, you should be fine.
As long as it's not interfering with anything else in your life it's not really harmful. Sometimes I'll do it 3 times in a row within 10-20 minutes and I'm a few years older than you lol
No worse than having sex 3 times a day. Well short of a world record. < M
No it's not bad, perfectly normal, some guys do it more than that a day
If you have the time, energy and stamina for it... feel free to masturbate as often or as little as you wish, just don't let it interfere with your normal daily routines, social interactions and responsibilities.
Well, it does kinda cut into another vital function for a15-year-old...like homework!
i mean thats a lot lol but i guess not
If you are really horny at the time, go for it.
Yes.........it's not nearly enough!
like everything......moderation is best
that is fine
No way that's true. I think you may have missed a 0 there
Sport & don't eat at night
Start exercising.
move more than u eat??
I'm not feeling suicidal or anything, but today I've been feeling more down than usual. I don't know why... it might be because i'm moving and it might be from stress... I just don't know. I'm only 11 and I don't know what to do. I don't think I should tell my mom yet because it was only today, if I feel the same tomorrow or Monday, I will let my mom know... I just don't want to say I feel depressed, but then it was just cause I was tired or stressed or something like that.
Yes, you may be depressed but don't get it mixed up with depression, they're two complete different things. You have nothing to concern about. If you're stressed or upset then you can definitely go talk to somebody as soon as possible, that would be your best option. Best of luck with your move! ~Don't Worry Be Happy!~ :-)
Of course not. Moving is stressful and sad. Why not mention to your mom that you feel kind of sad about moving. Hug each other for a few minutes. Humans don't dance and sing every second. Sometimes we're sad, scared, angry. They're called emotions. Edit You're not a mental health professional. You aren't qualified to diagnose depression. But you can tell your feelings. Like people do.
I’m so glad that you’re reaching out for some support today. Feeling depressed and stressed can be difficult to deal with on your own. I know that you weren’t sure whether you should talk with your mom, but it’s important that you let somebody close to you know how you’re feeling. Another family member, trusted teacher, school counselor, therapist, or doctor would be a good place to start and you can come up with some strategies to work through these feelings together. Know that you’re not alone, and there are always people and resources out there that can help. Great job reaching out today, please continue to do so! PF, Counselor
I think moving will make anyone have some depressed feelings.
You have a valid doubt. Know for certain that it is also a serious mental health problem. You should compulsorily take some drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. Consult a psychiatrist forthwith. There is no other go.
No, having this dream does not qualify as a fetish. When you are dreaming you cannot control the situations.
No, = wet dreams make you dream of piss. < M
Just the opposite bro
yep
no, it's the other way around, you smartass
Read a damn book about your own body. Men produce millions of spermatozoa a day.
You played the "five knuckle shuffle" 35 times a day? Good Lord.
Sperm cells are produced in the testicles by the millions daily. You will continue to produce these cells for many years to come.
Yeah but you should probably chill out with the nutting there
yes an probably quite quickly
Nope. I am afraid you wasted all your ammo.
why wouldn't you be able to?
if you cant others will step up
Yes
I have to take one as part of my medicines. It makes you bleed heavier than others though so when I had a blood test and the plaster fell off it was like a horror film!
In low doses, apparently it's good for some people. Others may not tolerate it so well.
It is for me now because my doctor prescribed it for me. I take Bayer 81 mgs once a day.
Yes, if you want to live a long life.
Medical advice is best when it comes from a doctor. Don't self medicate. :)
If your doctor has advised you to take an Aspirin then yes you should take it .
Yes it is
If you want to shave, then you should. It is your face and you treat it the way you want to, that lets you make the best impression that you can.
If you want, does not make any difference, Shavinig does not make it grow more or anything like that. If you don't like the look given your age, shave it.
It is up to you and your parents (plus any school rules on facial hair) as to whether you shave or not. Personally I would talk to my parents with the aim of shaving as facial hair does not look good on boys and young people.
Yeah you should, moustaches don't look cool on 12 year olds.
If its not too long let it grow it will look better then if you shave and then let it grow back all the time.
no you shouldn't its a normal thing for teenagers to experience this. wait until your in highschool. you're still in puberty as it might grow longer but its normal.
Kys
yes. It's not supose to be normal. But it is. There are other people with people. They are from the other realms. read this person facebook. Search James Hall. pick the pic with the pink highlight in his hair.
This isn't about being a writer. You happen to be a writer. You happen to have psychological problems. Then again, it might just be the drugs you indulge in.
I feel like that sometimes. It's just bending yourself to society. If you never laugh for real, you're hanging out around the wrong people. I try to be find people who are less "typical" and hang around nerdy people instead l, like writers and people who watch anime (since that's me ;))
for bc pills to work, you need to be consistent and take them daily at about the same time. missing a pill is a bad thing but if you take it as soon as you remember (not several days later), it's ok. remember that nothing is 100% but they are close to it and they do not protect you against disease.
You seem to have completely misunderstood what contraceptive pills do. You CAN'T just take one before sex and expect it to work; nor can you just take one a month. This should have been explained to your girlfriend by the doctor, nurse or clinic that prescribed them to her.
Contraceptive medication - talk to a health care professional appropriate to where you live.
read up on it ....!!!!!
You can have your mess when masturbating, theres no need to take it out, have a papertowel or tissue on your bed then fap your d!ck and let it cvm, and use your tissue to wipe out those mess, you can also cvm on your boxerz if you want to, or your dirty underwear you use the other day just to make sure its not visible if your not washing your clothes. You can *** on the toilet bowl, dude just fap it and shoot it and flush....no mess you say.
You can't! Unless you get a sex change or a vasectomy. Heres what I do to prevent a mess: just wrap ur dick in a sheet of paper towel, and *** into that paper towel. No mess, but it does generate more noise so be weary of that
Use towel, tissue or just shoot it on the wall. Btw you can fap while you're taking a shower
Tissue papers! Always works.
masturbate in he shower so that the mess does not matter
Just masturbate into the toilet. No clean up.
How about paper towels or Kleenex?
Do it in the shower. Using a sock is a classic.
collect every thing on your palm . If you want you can swallow too or just wash off. Regards.
Just let it fly- it adds to the excitement.
You do not need to count calories! Severely cutting back calories damages your metabolism. I eat low carb high fat (LCHF) foods and have lost weight and kept it off. I thoroughly enjoy what I eat too. I eat about 30-40g carbs per day and 100-120g fat per day. There's a lot of info online about LCHF and it's variants (keto, paleo, etc). I find support groups on social media helpful!
Small-ish. Define "big enough". It depends entirely on the girl's preferences, but 6inches plus is what they'd usually expect. You might grow more though,
You don't need a big dick to pleasure a girl. Hands and mouth works great. But don't worry, you're big enough to do the job
It's not the size of the hammer, it's how you swing it. Trust me. At 15, you will suck at all sexual activity. Why? Because you are a novice, and so is she. Like everything on Earth, it takes practice. Just be honest and always use a condom!
Plenty big enough. Yours is bigger than mine and I'm a lot older than you. I'd have sex with you
It's not the size of your tool, it's how you use it that matters.
Whoa. That's a small cack!
You're only 15 and that's is an average penile length. you'll be fine. let her see it.
You are seriously over thinking, and yes you will be more than fine.
your big enough to get the job done... be cool and confident
It means she has kidney failure, which is a life-threatening condition. Kidney dialysis can keep her alive and reasonably well for a long time. It takes several hours each time, so it is kind of like having a part-time job. If all goes well, she might be able to get a kidney transplant in the future, and would not need dialysis anymore.
When the kidneys can no longer function on their own to clean the blood and make urine, the body needs to get rid of waste somehow. Very basically dialysis does what the kidneys should do if they worked. She will be hooked up to a machine and her blood will be cycled through it, filtered, and put back in. She probably will have to go from multiple times a week to every day. She probably will not urinate much either, which is normal. This usually happens due to advanced age, kidney disease, or other diseases like diabetes.
It's a machine that removes impurities from the blood that the kidneys aren't doing properly. Without it the person would perish much sooner than with it. It can extend their life in hopes of getting a transplant.
I have always maintained healthy eating habits and try two exercise three times a week but I still have some weight that I just cannot lose. When I started with Weight Loss Green Store Tea product initially I felt let down but after the seventh day I started to see a gradual weight loss. I guess I was expecting a miracle and not letting Weight Loss Green Store Tea product get to work. I am now only a few pounds away from my target weight
Eat the things you enjoy just less of it. Stay active. All you need to lose weight is a calorie deficit. It isn't complicated but it can be hard at times when you're used to eating more but you get used to it.
you allow yourself a cheat day where u can eat whatever you want. Just not in insane quantities. Also, its hard but you need to grit your teeth and push on. Prove to the world that you are strong!
So I feel like everyone is beautiful but not weight wise. It's just things like buzz feed saying 'this plus sized woman looks better than a normal sized woman'. I'm not expecting everyone to be stick thin because that's not healthy, but it to be encouraged for obese (so much that it will damage your health) people to loose weight.
So you have shared your opinion. Do you have an actual question? What other people weigh really isn't any of your concern unless and until it impacts you directly. Right now, despite a so-called epidemic of obesity, alcohol and smoking take far greater tolls on the health of this nation than obesity does. Why are you not upset about that? Oh, right, because those people can still be attractive.
I totally get it. Carry extra weight and u can still be beautiful but if it's at the point where ur health is in danger then it shouldn't be normalised and encouraged.
OK so you want to be emancipated which means free from the control of someone, in your case your parents. You're suggesting taking drastic action - dying by suicide, in the event your parents do not grant you your emancipation or freedom. Are things so bad that you need to think this way? You need to focus on positive thoughts and ask yourself what actions do you need to take to live a life that YOU are happy with. Focus your attention on getting a job; if a paid job is not readily available at present how about doing some voluntary work with some organisation?
You are probably too young and don't have the funds or experience you would need to live on your own. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
To be emancipated you have to show the court that you are able to support yourself... you know, able to pay rent, buy food... AND continue going to high school (or have taken and passed the GED). But I don't think that even if you had that under your belt you would win over the judge... cause threatening to kill yourself if you don't get what you want isn't the mark of maturity... it shows that you are still nothing but a spoiled child.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online. if they are abusive u cna call cops teacher counselor etc all are required to help. if ur think its abuse but ur not sure uir heavily encouraged to check it out
I'm 14 and I barely finger myself but when I do, I feel it In me but it doesNt feel good. I kinda have small fingers but when I try a pen(non-pointy side) it hurts a little if u go to far but it doesn't feel good. I'm a virgin and I want it to feel good when I finger myself. but why doesn't it feel good? when I have sex when I get older would it feel Alot better then fingering?
You are young and you are learning about your body. It may be embarrassing but you need to find a trusted adult like a female doctor or a female aunt and talk to them. Masturbation is very normal and most people do it on a regular basis. You might need a gynecological exam of your genitals to make sure everything is ok down there. Do not stick things in there (pens) that dont belong. You can hurt yourself. Like I said...find a trusted adult and talk about sex. Its ok to talk about it with a trusted adult.
Perhaps you are sticking you're fingers up your árse.
In order to orgasm using the method you describe, you would need to apply direct stimulation to the g-spot. Since achieving g-spot orgasms is notoriously difficult, I suggest to focus on your clitoris instead. Clitoral orgasms are easier and much more intense.
try using a hair brush, markers, electric toothbrush, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, try find your moms dildo/vib when she is not home and have a great orgasm from that have sex now. dont need to wait
Urine is one of the safest body secretions to touch. It rarely carries any pathogens. It's not "unsafe" to touch any substance excreted by the human body, as long as you wash your hands with soap immediately afterwards. Otherwise it would be difficult to find people to work as nurses, home health aides, nursing home attendants, etc. Not to mention how risky it would be to change a baby's diaper.
You can drink it. It's sterile. Apply it on jellyfish stings. Don't listen to anyone who tells you otherwise, trust me. I would suggest knowing who's urine you're drinking though
There is usually no harm in touching urine, whether your own or somebody else's. However, please wash your hands with soap and warm water before doing anything else.
Fresh urine is sterile. After it sits for a while it forms a medium for bacterial growth and you should not touch it.
For the most part, urine is safe to touch.
Yes Don't drink it or apply it to wounds though XD
Well it won't kill you. Reasonable to wash your hands afterwards. < M
It's not toxic bro....

Nice try.
Most males are done growing in length by 14-15. Average is 5.16 inches.
Nice average size for an adult. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some extent.
thats average

Most people can't think for their self and rely on what others tell them. They're sheep that like to follow the herd. They don't want to research the benefits of alternative medicine on their own, and would rather pay someone else to tell them how to think or what to do. If people only realized if they ate a healthy plant based diet, exercised, and meditated most of their ailments and diseases wouldn't even exist. There's no money in a cure. That's why these doctors and pharmaceutical companies don't push holistic health. If everyone did it, they wouldn't be in business.
I find that a combination of alternative medicines alongside some prescription drugs is a good balance. I need a daily, small dose of H2O2 in order to keep my stretched bladder shrunk down, and formalized medicine does not recognize this. I also switched my primary doctor from an M.D. to an osteopath (D.O.), who is more receptive to some aspects of alternative medicine.
they're brainwashed stupid from years of lying medical propaganda. if they only heard the true outcomes of medicine instead of the false claims of it's fictional scientific basis and media hype they'd stay away from it. medical quackery remains just as it has throughout the centuries. now as then, it touts itself as the intellectual's choice, when in fact, it is the idiot's choice. it deceives many by co-opting the respect people have for true science and modern technology, as it makes use of technology to continue to do stupid things borrowing sophisticated tools to do them. it's outcomes of pathogenicity and death put the lie to it's claims of scientific basis or validity.
Hi, to get red of your hypertension first do some medical tests to know the cause, then do daily exercise, eat healthy, i recommend you do an angiography of your heart, brain, and blood channels, that will allow you get rid of hypertension, and prevent other illinesses, but you must see a doctor before doing the test, good luck
You need to lose weight and start getting some exercise on a daily basis. I know it's easier said than done, but frankly if you can stand not eating as much and come to terms with being hungry all the time, its not that much effort when you actually do it.
Lower your sodium intake - (watch the label for all packages - this would include soft drinks as well) Eating healthier would def help in losing weight which would in turn help lower your blood pressure. Stress can also be a trigger. I know we can't control our environment, but we can manage how we respond to stress ( Deep breath, yoga, etc...) Good luck. I've been there and it can be done! :)
You could also have a thyroid issue get it checked out but in reality getting your weight under control can change many things for the better. Instead of screwing around in gym class get exercising. Consider cycling it is fun and great exercise.
If you have been diagnosed with high blood pressure your doctor would discuss treatment options with you and your parents Make sure you are eating well also. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...
well with out me knowing your lifestyle it's hard to say. basic suggestions are simple eat low sodium and avoid red meat eat healthy fats. avoid sugar processed foods and fake sugar. drink water. lower your stress level. lose weight. all the things you most likely been told in the past. oh but one thing you haven't been told learn to love yourself for who you are. once you do that that will help with stress because you love who you are and have no need to try to be something you are not.
Lose extra pounds and watch your waistline. Blood pressure often increases as weight increases. ... Exercise regularly. ... Eat a healthy diet. ... Reduce sodium in your diet. ... Limit the amount of alcohol you drink.

My dads been smoking cigarettes for as long as I can remember. I'm 13 years old, and I'm terrified of losing him. He smokes 5-10 a day, or so. I've been trying to get him to quit, but when I bring it up he sort of shakes it's off. His mom used to smoke 8 cigs a day and she's almost 90, but his brother used to smoke and developed lung cancer (he later died). Today he mentioned that he has has a sour muscle pain in his middle part of arm. I'm so scared... How can I get him to quit? Help please.
You have to want to quit before you're able to quit. I know, I smoked for 11 years. As far as getting lung cancer from smoking...some people smoke 5 cigs per day, and end up getting lung cancer at 40. Some smoke 2 packs a day and die from natural causes at 90. There's no telling when or how you're going to go, but certainly, smoking will put you on the fast track to death.
Dear, you can't control what he does, you can't get him to quit. You learn about the harmful effects of smoking in school so YOU don't take up the very bad habit. Of course you would be scared when you're told smoking causes cancer, etc. But again, this is his life, only in his control to quit or not.
Tell him that he is poisoning YOUR air. He may not care about himself, but he should care about the harm he is doing to his kids. Even if he smokes outside, it still comes back in the house. Many states have free programs for gum and such to help him stop. I'm sure he thinks that 5 a day isn't much, and it's not. But it still is doing the damage. You can also tell him children of smokers are far more likely to become lifelong smokers.
Tell the harmful aspect to him

A serious neurological issue. A seizure disorder, a tumor. What are the doctors saying?
Seizure isn't really well understood. I hope you have some help for him.
a seizure
He needs to get to a hospital ASAP. There are more things that can cause this than we can tell you.
brain tumor, hypoglycemia. drug use. chemical imbalance in the brain. Brain swelling. Heart attack. Medication.
a possible stroke
It would totally depend on what kind of diabetes pills you are taking. And you should be asking your doctor or pharmacist this question. Most medications these days, you need to take them on a regular basis, about the same time each day, for them to be effective. If you go into lows, you need to talk to your medical people to find out why and to see what kind of adjustments in your daily routine need to be changed so you no longer go into lows.
Which specific diabetic pill, sir? There are different types of anti-hyperglycemic medications and they work in different ways.
If you are eating your food before takig the pills how can your sugar levels be low? If it is low go ask your doctor what the problem is
Eat more sugar.
I wouldn't take if my BG was low
depends on the type of pills you have been prescribed. http://www.joslin.org/info/oral_diabetes...

Controlled drugs, probably not. Prescriptions for controlled drugs are written for ONE 30-day supply, and your doctor has to "renew" your prescription every month. They don't want you to be able to "stockpile" those drugs. A prescription for almost all other types drugs (such as birth control pills) -- sure. For example, a prescription for birth control is written for 12 refills. You could have the pharmacist fill a 3-month supply at one time, if you can afford to pay that much at one whack.
Depends on WHAT prescription. Controlled substances like pain pills and adderall, no. Birth control, yes.
Depends on the prescription. If it's for a controlled substance like opioids or painkilers, probably no. If it's for something more friendly like birth control, probably yes.
It depends on what it is for. Controlled drugs are only allowed to be dispensed 3 days before they are do.
prescription for what, exactly?
sure you can if you run out
They are called bite blocks. They are either 2 clumps pf glue on the molars, or 2 blocks that go on the front 2 teeth that prevent you biting them off. Hope this helps! :)
They are called Bite Turbos/Bite Blocks
In the office where I work, we call those things "Bite Turbos" Your orthodontist might have a different name for them.

Difference being white semen contains a large amount of sperm, clear seminal fluid contains a small amount
There is no difference except in the colour! The quantity of sperm in the semen is less than 1% of the total volume and make no difference to the colour. Semen colour is more related to your diet and how long since your last ejaculation.
There's some variation in ejaculate color and clarity. By the way, mem Who practice the "withdrawal method" of birth control are eventually called "fathers".
white semen = high sperm cell count clear = little or no sperm cells
Not much, it mostly has to do with how much water your drinking.
Use baby oil = or kitchen oil in emergency = squeeze glans head with finger/ thumb, wriggle foreskin forward to normal. < M
Sure, you can touch it, you know, and fix that if it is uncomfortable. Your gear.
can't you just pull it back down?
Everything you're doing (diet and exercise) indicates you're probably starving yourself to death. If you want to start eating again, begin with some clear soup (broth) and some crackers. Stay away from all kinds of fats (including cheese) for now. After a day or so, add some cooked veggies to the clear soup and maybe a little cooked chicken as well. Have this several times a day for a couple of days. Then you can add some fruit. After nearly starving yourself to death, you cannot just start eating normally again. Your body cannot handle the sudden onslaught of food (as you have already learned).
You're starving yourself to death. That number of calories is far too low. I think the reason you feel sick is that you now have insufficient blood sugar to keep your brain functioning normally. You probably need to get medical help otherwise you could kill yourself, and possibly quite soon.
Oh by the way I am also doing the insanity workout and I'm on my second round at week 2, is that changes anything
Of course it is normal, your a guy and a girl touched your gear, how good is that?, i would be very lucky if i am you.
Panis is a type of bread. < M

No.
it's possible to gain a pound in an hour
Yes, it is quite possible. Just normal weight fluctuations can do that without even trying to gain weight.
Of course. Your body weigh fluctuates 1-3 lbs daily anyway.
I would call it water weight. Although, it is possible. Probably bloat.
If you haven't been tracking how much you eat, it is very possible.
Hi... Im 13 and I cant help it but im really really horny. I just really want some sort of way to have sex with myself that isnt just plain masturbation. I need ways to have amazing self sex, weather it be with homemade sex toys or not. I just really need help because I cant stand this anymore... I just need relief after this long day. Also, I want it to be kind of private in a way, meaning nobody will hear me or suspect anything.
Sex in the shower is fun- not much you can do without the old stroke stroke stroke method. Just change up your tehnique and discover other areas of your body that are sexually sensitive.
Have a look on jackinworld.com as there's lots of safe ideas you can try out to your heart's content. Have fun.

When we plan to have anal sex, we give ourselves an enema the night before -- preferably two entire bags, taken a quart or so at the time, held then released. This cleans you out. But don't give yourself any enemas until you G00gle How To. You don't want to tear your rectum, etc. Shltting on someone during anal sex is common, hence the enema. It's beyond me why a girl would want to have anal sex.. females have nothing to stimulate up the anus.... but those who like pain would probably be into it i guess. Men have the sensitive and easily stimulated prostate gland up inside their anus, so this is a different story all together.

Yes, meditation works or counseling..I use crystals but eposom salt helps with balancing your charkas and aura.
No - but behavioral health therapy can be very helpful in addressing anxiety issues and their underlying causes. It's natural and may even be covered by insurance.
They don't work. There is no evidence indicating they work. that's why you couldn't find any.
No, it's silliness. Try meditation; many studies suggest it helps, though the results take time.
anxiety is often a symptom of adrenal insufficiency from chronic pathological overstimulation due to nerve interference. other symptoms of adrenal insufficiency can include a tendency for cold hands and feet, photophobia, night sweats, allergies, and/or migraines. see an hio method chiropractor.
I doubt it, but not all prescription drugs work either.
Not at all. Placebo only.
No they don't. I have tried.
Depends on how they want your treatment to progress. Anything that can delay the process can do so anywhere from a few days to possibly months. You will probably have braces well before the end of summer no matter what, but the only person who would know for sure is your orthodontist, feel free to ask them any questions you have. Braces are expensive and i think you are due some answers to anything you want to know.
Generally after the consultation they have one appointment to take more x-rays, make holds and say if you need any extractions. About 4 weeks after that you can expect to get braces. Hope this helps you! :)
It can depend on a lot of different things. I had to wear spacers (little rubber bands) between my teeth for 3 weeks to make room for the braces. The orthodontist should be able to tell you after your exam and x-rays.
well they can't
... They can't hear what you're thinking
you should see a doctor, counselor, therapist.
They know....
Schedule an appointment with your family doctor. When the doctor asks what bring you in today show them what you have written here. Use that as a basis for having a frank discussion on how you are doing. They can do a full physical and neurological workup to rule out medical issues that may be causing or contributing to your issue. They can refer you to sleep specialist for a sleep study. Your doctor can also refer you to a mental health professional that can evaluate your mental state. Once the test results are in, treatment options can be discussed.
You should see a doctor. Could be an ear infection or something else BPPV.
Could be Virtigo

It will strengthen the muscles. Your diet and genetics will determine any size changes.

Covering yourself keeps you keeps you warm, it doesn't make you warm. The covering isn't warm. The body's metabolism, it's functioning creates heat, like a car engines functioning creates heat. A normal height is 98.6 Fahrenheit, 37 Celsius. Physical activity increases the body's processes, it's metabolism and that increases the heat. When athletes warm up to practice a sport, the purpose is to raise their body temperature a degree because the body functions better at that temperature. When your body fights an infection like a flu virus, your metabolism rises A LOT because your body does a lot to fight it, that is called a fever.
Your heart pumps faster and your muscles generate heat through the work they do. It's simple physics.
Movement makes you sweat. Easy explanation. That's why joggers wear next to nothing, even in the winter!
Homeopathic treatments are always ineffective as they have no medicinal capabilities. Ayurveda is so old it is totally obsolete. It often uses toxic metals in preparations that no sane person should even think about taking. They are commonly contaminated with lead, mercury and arsenic.
Neither are considered to be medicine. Homeopathy and Ayurveda are belief systems. They have no standard of care or system of measurement - they're a hodgepodge of rituals. See a medical Dr.
Try a low salt diet and take water pills.
Neither have any effect better than placebo
Well it certainly exercises the cremaster muscles. Adding weights not a good idea, though. < M
Will it help it in what way? Your question makes no sense.
sounds painful
A) No, no reason it would. and b) don't do that- you can damage your gear.
nope dude, nothing to do
The pills are not FDA approved because they do not work and may also contain harmful ingredients. There is absolutely no pill, device or exercise that can permanently and safely enlarge your penis. The adult erect size of your penis is genetically determined and cannot be changed. Don't waste your money and risk damage to your entire system by buying into this scam.

I saw a dead body today and I think I'm completely traumatized I can't sleep I can't even be in the dark I usually sleep with a dim light but I can't even do that when i turned off the light I imagined the face and I had to immediately turn the light back on and then I started Hyperventilating I was so scared
Give yourself a few days to relax. Avoid violent tv shows and video games, hang with chill friends, listen to calming music. You knew before and know now that people die, and in a few days most of the trauma will probably wear off if you take care of yourself. Sleep with the light on for a few days, and if you imagine the face again, just tell it to rest in peace. If you still have this difficulty after a week or two, see a therapist.
I think you're just in shock! And I'm so sorry for that unfortunate experience. I've had situations like this... Not exactly with dead bodies but of other scary images. The best thing I can tell you is that time will heal you. As the days go by, that experience will be in the past. You will be fine!
this is just because you can't forgot that.you should do different types of activities which entertain yourself.give some time to relax yourself.whenever you remember that then think about your happiest memory it will make you relief and relaxation.
You have a panic attack. Drink a double tea bag mug of chamomile tea and you will sleep soundly.
Within the past two weeks or so, there s been this disgusting taste/smell in my mouth. Sometimes when I eat food I ll taste feces or something and it s ruined . I realized that on the left side of the back of my mouth, if I make a suctioning motion, I can really taste it. Almost as if it s coming from in between the last two teeth on the top row. Why is this so? I ve never had any cavities, I brush and floss nearly everyday, so what s happening. It s really disgusting, luckily it doesn t smell as horrible as it tastes. How can I get rid of it? What IS it?
Get a mirror and take a look at the back of your throat. You may see little white, foul-smelling 'stones', called tonsil stones at the sides. It is possible to poke and and scrape them out using something like a thin long, wooden toothpick but take a lot of care doing so. Once done, brush your teeth, mouth and tongue thoroughly and repeat.
If you have cancer, and are taking Chemotherapy, that might be one reason. Second thing, your teeth may be rotting. I'm not a dentist, but it sounds plausible to me, that if your enamel erodes, and exposes the tissue in your teeth, and then that rots, it's very likely that's why. Again, I'm not a dentist. I'd go to one right away, as some dental diseases are among the deadliest in the world.
Go to the dentist ASAP. That taste is bacteria and a sign that the area may be septic. Rinse with salt and water, thoroughly.
How do you know what poo tastes like?
You have a rotting tooth. Time to see el dentisto.
My guess is tonsil stones. But as all other answers say, visit a dentist. Could be something way worse
m on the pill and I had unprotected sex 10 weeks ago. We were fooling around and got caught up in the moment and things went further than they should. Basically he got as far as putting his penis in before i stopped anything further happening. Since then ive had two what appeared to be normal periods. Yesterday i was due to start my period and it seemed like it was all on track however it has only been brown blood and very light. Im usually quite heavy. Even today it got a little heavier during the day but now appears to be like spotting brown blood here and there. Does anyone know what this could mean?
You're on the pill, so you were protected. You've bled twice since then (they are not periods on the pill, they are withdrawal bleeds). Take a test if you're worried.
I would say that you are fine .If you are really worried I would suggest that you take a pregnancy test to put your mind at rest .
You're on the pill. Ergo, you did not have "unprotected sex". The pill IS protection...
It starts as volunteering with a background check.
It helps if you can put on your application under experience that you have committed suicide.

An overdose of anything can kill you. Try to find out his doctor's name and report your brother's abuse of drugs.
It's fairly rare that people die right away from illegal drugs. More likely is a long, gradual decline. The end up addicted and that is what is called The New Normal. They cannot function without drugs. Then they can't hold a job, they make bad decisions. The may commit other crimes to get money to get drugs. They may end up in jail. Very often they do die much younger than people who don't do drugs.
A person addicted to prescription drugs can, but not always progress to harder drugs, even Heroin. I am addicted to Percocet and about every 6 months I quit for about 2 months and then start back. I have never been tempted to use anything else, but that is me. My brother started on weed and now uses anything he can get.
abusing any kind of drug will kill you overtime. you can be instantly killed from pills if you overdose.. otherwise you die very slowly over the period of time you abuse these drugs. pills can also cause long term damage to your brain/health.
yes
yes they do if they don't get the help they need
Make an appointment with your orthodontist as soon as possible. Braces should never scratch your mouth.
To be honest as you have already done all the things you can do it is best for your mouth to build up the skin again. This makes it tougher and won't hurt anymore. Hope this helps you! :)
Anxiety will attack like this only. The root cause for worries and anxieties is illegitimate desire. In future avoid all such illegitimate desires and remain safe. Perfect mental health is very important for this.
If you're worried that much you should talk to your parents/guardian. they can make an appointment with a doctor who hopefully will be able to help.
try reading a book..listening to calm, relaxing music.
because sex is never supposed to hurt and just because some people believe in the myth that women are supposed to bleed the first time doesn't make it true
Everybody's different. There usually isn't much more than one or two drops of blood the first time, anyway.
well not all girls bleed when their cherry is popped and not all girls have pain the first time
Why should it??
There s only one person in the world who decides what your going to do and that s you. The negative people around you are noise, just noise. Think about about what you ve seen and what there s left to see. If your not allowed to leave for three years make use of those three years to learn everything you can . Yes things are bad but they can always be worse. This is from personal experience.
It seems you have been completely mislead or misguided by some unscrupulous element or mischief monger. Please join Yoga and meditation classes and learn their techniques systematically. In Yoga, they teach you lot of physical exercises coupled with some mental exercises also in order to keep your body and mind always fit, trim and strong. Then you can easily shape your future life according to your tastes.
sounds rough. I've had a shitty life too. yea, try to stay under the radar and when you turn 18 try to find something you like to do and try to find some nice people. it's rough though. good luck
You should take her to get her seen firstly, if she is not wanting to get help herself that's when you have to step in and help her out, I understand that you love her, but what she's doing can get dangerous REALLY FAST, she might not even know what she's doing at times. Again for yours and hers safety, get her examined by her doctor, it can save both of your lives and it can make her feel better too. I wish you both the best!
Take her to a nearby mental health facility for diagnosis and treatment. If she has meds, make sure she takes them. And, meds should not be mixed with quarts of beer, street drugs, or any other verboten substances.
I see you have caught the self diagnosis bug. What is Schizo by the way? Schizophrenia? Schizoaffective Disorder? Schizoid Personality Disorder, Schizotypal? There are a bunch of Schizos.... If she is threatening you then call the police or call her doctor. She has a doctor right?
You need a real diagnosis from a real medical specialist. My ex was bipolar, probably more mental issues. If that's her, leave immediately.
These are demons (fallen angels) dont take false medication that just makes it wrose and allows more demons in! try and find a deliverence minister, but seek jesus first and get him into your lives!
I'm sure with the right medication and treatment she will be fine, but I can understand your concern. If she is not currently seeing a specialist then please take her for help
I am extremely sorry to read about your sad plight. If you really want wonders or miracles to happen in your real life. you should pray daily at least for two minutes. Pray honestly and sincerely with implicit faith, unshakable belief and unflinching devotion. Your genuine prayers will never go waste. It will be suitably rewarded by God. Be optimistic. If you sow a mango seed, you will soon get a big mango tree, which will give you sweet mangoes. This suggestion was given to me by my Mentor, when I faced similar problems last year.

well, sir- it sounds to me it would me much better , healthier and safer for both your wife and yourself -to get her examined- by a psychiatrist-in real life-in your area- with no further delay if possible...
You're pushing your luck on potential internal bleeding with that much aspirin. I used to know a guy with epilepsy who said he needed to take aspirin until his ears rang for control of the epilepsy - it worked, but caused other health problems. Talk to a doctor and see if there's a better way.
Yes Aspirin is not good for you, you should limit your intake
yes.

Not being able to breathe - gasping desperately for air - is bad enough. It's like that, plus coughing violently at the same time. You can breathe, but very thinly. Your throat also feels extremely sore and dry. It's very unlikely that it'll kill you, but if you don't get help soon, you'll be recovering for quite a while.

Tell the cops, take him to a mental health physician and keep him under watch do not leave him alone or isolated
If he's done this sort of thing for attention, then call him out on it. But if you're actually worried, tell your parents.
can you call his therapist leave message about thisif u don't get to talk to him
If you want some wonders or miracles to happen, please recite hundred times "Do, Did, Done" religiously. It may save his life.
Sorry, but it looks like your growth plates are mostly closed. Compare with these links and the related photos. There's no space on your photos in these areas. That means that your epiphyseal plates have already "fused", so little (if any) growth should be expected.
These images are of closed growth plates as one would expect for a man over 16. You have stopped growing for good.
Sounds like you have a "urinary tract infection" You would have to see a doctor to get rid of the infection.
than see a doctor for a possible infection
urinary tract infection maybe, take d-mannose, get it checked out to be sure
Because it sounds like you have an infection.
No it's not.... probably a bad urinary tract infection. See a doctor, they will likely put you on antibiotics. You have to get medication so tell your mom or whoever is responsible for you if you're under 18. If not, just get to a doctor for help. Urinary tract infections are common... nothing to be embarrassed about.
no it is not normal to pee blood. you likely have a urinary tract infection.. unless you have your period and think the blood came from your urine
I think you should go to a doctor, that's not good. Are you hurting anywhere?

I had for the first time 11 days ago. It was very hurtful and it took several trials to break my hymen. I was bleeding the next morning but it didnt hurt then. He penetrated me 10 times in 3 days after the first time and it was okay and he is well endowed . But 7 days ago my vagina started to hurt. I couldnt walk. It feels weird. And now i am very worried. So is that probably because he penetrated me several times in a short period ?
Whöre
If you are really young then maybe its because you did it several times.... But its normal to hurt after the first time
There was probably too much friction. Try using lubricant if you haven't been using any.
You need to see a doctor or even a urgent care facility to be sure what it is. If it is an appendix you may need immediate treatment.
Could be anything from a lymph node to a hernia to a mass to gas. See a care provider.
The appendix, most likely
It could be your appendix, or it could be your ovary.
Hell no, nothings bad for you if you keep within your calories, macros. You could eat mcdonalds everyday before school and be healthy.
Not if it's the healthy kind of cereal bar. Look for whole grains and a High Fiber content, with a low sugar amount.
No, its probably not bad for you, but. Check the sugar content cause a lot of those bars have a lot of it. It's not gonna be better than fruit and maybe a peanut butter sandwich. Your body needs fuel in the morning, that's why they say breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
not likely to find a massage parlor to do tantric....get your gf to do it, or rent an escort that knows how

1) Rangers are not Special Forces 2) Fort Bliss is in Texas not Colorado 3) There are no Rangers at Fort Bliss or at Fort Carson which is in Colorado 4) Rangers are only at three posts in the US. They normally deploy as a battalion, not as a company. Care to get your facts straight and then come back with a better troll?
Rangers and Special Forces are not the same...and Fort Bliss is not in Colorado. OH well, Happy Mother's day anyway.
I did too, but came back a different person. The situation was not good. The USA is a Bully and your son has been sucked into doing its bidding. I left a part of myself buried in the sand in the Middle East. I was not very happy. I told them I was a "conscientious objector", and left the military over 20 years ago. After I returned I changed form Christian to Buddhist. I am now a pacifist. Your son may be in deeper than he wants to be. I learned job skills in the military. That alwats helps!
Rangers aren't Special Forces; and FT. Bliss is in Texas not Colorado.
I'm not in the army but agree with those saying you need to do more research before embarrassing yourself.
Thank you for divulging troop movements on a public forum. All the prayers in the world won't undo the potential damage that creates, you know.
Cool story bruh Too bad it isn't true. Try some research before trolling. You'll look less stupid that way
I understand your sentiment, but talking even THAT much about your son's activity is stupid and dangerous.
You do of course know you shouldn't be posting this sort of information on the internet do you?

It can give you a virus the same way smashing your phone into the sidewalk would leave it unscathed, not going to happen but before i was 18 i didn't use porn to get off at all, i just thought about something that turned me on

Your crush, thinking about porn, remembering porn. Also, it doesn't give me a virus, or anyone else I know...

Dandruff, scalp psoriasis, and dry scalp are all common reasons. Also using water too hot in the shower is another reason, too. Dry scalp & dandruff can be solved with products such as Head & Shoulders or Selsun Blue. Scalp Psoriasis (there's another name for it) can be maintained (you can't cure it) with things such Neutrogena T/Sal, Neutrogena T/Gel, or Nizoral. Don't use the shampoo every time you shower. Have another shampoo. Use it only 1-3x a week and you let this one sit on your scalp for a bit. You can also invest in a rubber scalp brush.
Always use a shampoo for dry hair. Take a tablespoon of Olive Oil every day. It's good for your cholesterol levels and in a few weeks, your hair will improve.
Most likely you are having a reaction to SLS (sodium laurel sulfate) It is a chemical that is added to soaps/shampoos etc. in order to make it lather. Burt's Bees has a shampoo that is SLS free.

So over a year now I've had anal bleeding been to doctor they said it's hemorrhoids, this was two months ago.. It's still bleeding itching and has flesh hanging out, do hemorrhoids last for a year? I see my other doctor my obgyn doctor in 2 weeks for the annual exam, should I mention it to them? Just not sure what it could be Google always says cancer so although is a possibility was wondering if anyone else had experienced a bleeding sore recum for over a year after having a baby?
That's pretty common. Having a baby makes you strain and push and you sort of blow out the veins around your rectum. The bleeding is what's called Fissures or split skin from pooping and will itch and bleed. If you have a hard time pooping you split the fissures open over and over. Not much you can do other then surgery.
The best thing is to go to the doctor and not take medical advice from dried up old hags like Edna who has a 5% success with answering sexual health questions.
Yes...as a matter of fact, I have had MINE for 35 YEARS now. Sure. Go ahead and mention it. He will tell you the same exact thing. Absolutely...and even more so, after having a baby.
once you get them they will be with you for ever, use preparation h to stop itch than eat good food because it will make your bm's softer. after few weeks the swelling will go down and back to normal but when they flair up need to repeat life style.of using cream and soft food.
to begin with there are NO symptoms! After a person has had diabetes for a couple of years the high glucose (blood sugar) damages other organs and thus causes the symptoms. See your doctor for blood work every year to make sure you don't have diabetes before it causes the symptoms of other organs being damaged!!
Subtle and vague symptoms: - excessive thirst - excessive urination - tiredness and lethargy - increased hunger feelings - headaches - leg cramps - mood swings - dizziness More specific and concerning symptoms: - slow healing cuts and injuries - itching and skin infections - blurred vision If you are concerned, talk to your doctor about it. If you are a healthy adult with no family history of diabetes type 2, there is a much lower risk of you having it.
Some are extreme thirst, urinating a lot, weight loss, extreme tiredness after eating...
tringlling hands and feet urination weight loss fatigue excessive thirst if you want to know the signs seriously then you should consult with your doctor
Preing a lot
I m 13 and I ve had my period for a while. Anyways yesterday my mom and I were at the store and needed pads and I asked my mom if u could get tampons cuz their easier, less messy, etc. and she said no cuz I m a little girl and then shouldn t be anything inside me until I m like 20 something. I m like what the ****!! Honestly what is her problem pls help. Thx
Your momis wrong, you can wear tampons, what your mom is talking about is that if you use tampons it will break your hymen. You are making absolutely the right choice by choosing to use tampons. pads are bulky and uncomfortable
????? She is over reacting, and that is not true at all. Perhaps you can take her to the doctor with you and HE can explain to her why it is perfectly fine for you to wear tampons.
use her tampons. you can have fingers to a penis in you at this age
Drink allot of fluids Whenever it hurts eat popsicles Sleep longer so you leave your throat be longer. Take water to bed. You cannbuy lisengers that numb your throat a bit if you cant stop clearing your throat. But drinking water, broth, and popsicles is key
Take hot water put salt in it and gargle for 5 minutes Trust me it works I have tried this whe I was going through same situation! Good Luck👍🏼
Drink a bottle of Tabasco in one gulp
The natural way is to take a teaspoon of raw honey, drink warm ginger ale, swish your mouth with salt. .
Garble with warm salt water. Take ibuprofen.
Gargle with a medium strength lager. It may not work but it's enjoyable.
Warm lemon honey tea and ibuprofen
Water with syrup.
Benzydamine Is great
to do with absorbing shock, I think. Anyway, soak your feet in a tub
Eat fiber drink water
Take it up with a crap expert!
Do not strain, this can cause anal tears and hemmaroids, you mose like have constipation, take some fiber supplements.
Beans, whole grain cereal, lots of water.
After
You should brush your teeth after breakfast.
Before.
Before because bacteria grows in your mouth overnight!! And by eating breakfast, you are basically eating that bacteria. And by the way, you should not brush your teeth until 30 minutes after you've eaten. Look it up.
I always brush them before breakfast. But if you can brush them after breakfast would be okay if you don't mind the morning mouth taste while eating breakfast.
After. But brushing them before would be much better than not brushing them at all. Despite what many people think, the primary goal of brushing is not getting the food off your teeth. Your saliva does a very good job of that, but it doesn't do it right away. The primary goal of brushing is getting the plaque off your teeth. It also removes the food faster than the saliva does, so it would be a bit better to brush after you eat than before.
You are not Gay. LOL LOL LOL ROFLMAO Brahhhhhhaaaaaaahahhahahahaahah
Weird i can just imagin me and my best mate out in the mall and then we do that? We'll be kicked out of there in a new york minuite
Well it certainly is unique and something that is kinda cool to do. Just as long as you don't get caught by other guys doing that.
Nope, as long as you don't tell everyone..
I was sleeping and I was dreaming I was in the bathroom doing my buisness but then I woke up and I was really wetting my bed. I got up right away and went to the bathroom to clean myself. I feel so embarassed about this... could it be related to yesterday s work? I worked since 8 am til 5 pm. I couldn t stop crying of shame this morning. I feel like a loser
It's not your fault. Have you ever had a dream where you were falling off of a building and then woke up right before you hit the ground and jumped up? The same thing is going on. Don't be ashamed it's your brains fault not yours
I didn't say anything at the time ,but now Im wondering a bit about him . He wasn't a bit shy. He's a athletic dude so I guess he's just not shy and I could see he wasn't shy when he got out of bed in the morning( you know what I mean guys) . Is this normal behaviour or am I just overthinking it?
Yes, it is perfectly normal for men (and teens) to sleep naked. In fact it is much better to sleep that way as you get a deeper sleep when not encumbered by any clothing. If you and he are true buddies then you shouldn't care about seeing one another naked at times like that, or at the gym, etc. A good friend of mine and I had to share a bed unexpectedly one year on holiday in France. We both slept naked as we usually do. As we are not gay, nothing happened between us.
I'm not a guy, but I did have to share a bed with a friend a few times during a trip. I just asked if she would mind if I slept naked (since I really have a hard time sleeping comfortably with clothes). She was OK with it. It's no big deal.
I sleep naked, and have done so in a shared room with separate beds. If I had to shave a bed with another man, I think I'd wear underwear. Like Maurice said, waking up with hand on another man's naked nuts would be awkward, as would finding another man's hand on mine. Not the end of the world, but awkward. As your your buddy, since he's not at all shy, if he didn't initiate any touching, I'd just forget about it. B0ner and all. Forget it.
Well its not really a big deal either way. Some guys sleep naked and others don't. It really doesn't matter if you were both naked its just a thing. Doesn't mean anything.
Normal for a homosexual.It isn't a question of sleeeping naked. It is a question of sharing the bed naked. I don't think I would have gone along with that. It is too lax, by half. Even dismissing outright homosexuality, it is imposing. Some underwear would have been in order. Also helps keep the farts in.
He is obviously relaxed and comfortable with his body. Many guys like to sleep naked although likely few would share a bed with a guy and sleep naked. I wouldn't worry about it as obviously he isn't worried.
I agree with everyone who said it's normal. I myself am gay, but have nothing but straight friends and we all sleep naked when we stay at eachother's houses. We'll even sit around and play video games naked. If my straight friends are okay with being naked around a gay guy, you should have nothing to worry about.
Yes, lots of us sleep naked, and are not going to change just because of a shared bed. If he didn't look at you or touch you just ignore it.
There could be a few sources of a heart beat.. this could range of acid rreflux; you could be pregnant; exercising ; blood flowing through your heart;& anxiety/ fear of something; scared of heights;the thought of a loved one; celebrations; being yelled at for no reason & etc.
i agreed with Renee but my answer there r two heart sounds 1.first sound is LUB which occur due to closure of tricispid and bicuspid valves at the start of ventricular contraction 2.second sound is DUP which occur due to closure of semilunar valves at the start of ventricular relaxation
What you hear as a "heart beat" is actually muscle contractions of the organ (the heart) itself.
It's the valves in your heart "slamming" shut as your heart chambers contract and relax.

any doctor can write a lab order for blood work to check hormone levels it doesn't need to be an OBGYN and no evening primrose does nothing for acne. you would be better off to just go to the dermatologist and get a prescription for your acne. having acne does not mean you have a hormonal imbalance especially if you are getting a period every month
You can go see either doctor. If a GP thinks that your issue is something that needs a specialist's care they can write you a referral, and if it's something straightforward hey can help you themselves. Like all herbal remedies, there's a lot of grandiose claims about there about EPO and almost no evidence that any of them are true. But it's likely to be reasonably harmless... though if you are taking any other medications you should discuss it with your doctor, since it can cause problems with some other drugs.
You can see either your GYN or your GP and they could order bloodwork based on what they think is going on. If needed, they may send you to a specialist (likely an Endocrinologist).
consult with doctor
No
Playing sports twice a week is healthy, but jogging is not, as long as it puts too much strain on the knuckles. Brisk walking coupled with HIIT is your healthiest option.
Umm duh the person A is way more healthy. Protein shakes are unhealthy. The only healthy once are natural fruit or veggie once. Jogging is way better than being in gym for 2h a day. You relax your mind and spirit. In gym you usually push yourself of the limits and exercise way to much.
-That 4th Wisdom Tooth might NOT have Emerged yet ( it was still just UNDER the Gum Line ). So He STILL might've dug it out... :)
Just ask him about this! He won't tell you there were four if there were three! There was something in the x-rays you didn't understand. Happens to the best of us. :)
Count your teeth. It's not hard.
First of all why put it in a jar when your hands are fully capable of... Wait for your penis to be flaccid or use oils or lubricants to slowly remove it from the "jar". Breaking the jar would be your last option. Goodluck.
It is your serious mistake. You should have taken prior instructions or permission from elders and knowledgeable people in your family in a discreet manner (confidentially), before experimenting such misadventures. Now you have to break the jar. There is no other solution.
Is it a glass jar ? you could very carefully break the glass where its gripping your penis, or wait till your erection goes down ,or use butter or oil to ease it out,now you have tried it ! you are not the first .
Serves you right for baiting masters. < M
ice it down
hahahah what dummy your are..
Some males are built that way. But you can make lemonade out of lemons; as you don't climax, you have staying power. And sexually active women like a man who can keep on trucking. Even though you have no climax, they can have multiple ones during one session. They'll love you forever.
Honestly, it's probably because you masturbate too much. You've gotten used to your hand and pornography so the real thing isn't that great for you. You should stop watching pornography and masturbating.

are you gay?
That's called being an exhibitionist. Whilst you might get off on the thrill of being discovered (or potentially discovered) if indeed that DOES happen, you'd soon come down from the clouds, as you'd be fired, taken to court and quite possibly charged as a sex offender. After which, you'll find it VERY hard to get work, not to mention, live down the stigma.
Dangerous. Do you want to get fired?

Scrub the area with these pads - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too.

it's usually a combination of poor personal hygiene and poor diet , you may have parasites , get checked
First of all, for the people saying "lemon juice" - No. Absolutely not. Lemon juice is an acid which can burn your gums and destroy the enamel on your teeth. Secondly, you don't add anything to baking powder -- you might try baking SODA. Many people make a "paste" of baking soda and water, then brush with that. Some people put baking soda on top of their toothpaste. You can buy toothpaste with baking soda already in it. But -- baking soda will not "whiten" teeth. It might remove some slight surface stains, but you won't get dazzling white teeth from that alone.
I ve heard Lemon Juice and Sugar Does a great job of removing plaque.
You're supposed to just use water but to be honest it doesn't work. I've tried everything because I used to be paranoid about my teeth: I eventually ordered crest whitening strips off the Internet and they work amazingly!!! They're not that pricey
Hydrochloric acid
lemon juice?
Your dog has the advantage here, because you're feeding her, therefore you control what she eats. So switch roles, put her in charge of your diet. Then she will be fat, you will be thin, and get to humiliate her.
Admit your dog to a Dog care house and see how your dog get rid out from being fatty.
If your dog is fat then it's not as healthy as it should be. If your dog is fat then the person who feeds it needs to cut back on his/her food.
Yahoo needs a new category for your questions, I suggest Stupid and Inane Questions.
Please check-up the Dog's mental health. There must be something wrong. Because you are jack of all trades..
Highly doubt it.
Make sure she's comfortable and enjoying what you're doing. Look into sex guides and various positions to try, get into oral, try new things. Make sure to be enjoying it yourself as well. You want to encourage her and pleasure her, call her hot names, tell her what you like, whisper in her ear dirty things. The list is endless, just look through some guides or ask the girl what turns her on the most. Im sure if you're enjoying it, she will be too
Every woman is different so i think talking about sexual preferences and what is exciting for your partner is the best way to start.
give her your credit card
I'm younger and I don't have access to a doctor as most adults do so I can't really go get it checked out until I'm positive because it costs a bunch. Anyway when I climb stairs or walk I get out of breath so easily and it's been getting worse. I play tennis and during practice I can't run and move as well. I also get cramps in my lower abdomen around my stomach area if I push myself to run or climb more. I get tired so easily! Plus I have trouble breathing when I'm this tired... So I just wanted to know if this could be a form of asthma and should I be concerned? Thank you :))
Asthma is a condition where the airway constricts from swelling. You can sort of test yourself for asthma by trying to exhale as rapidly as you can when you are having trouble breathing. A person without asthma can exhale completely with little effort in 1 second or less. A person with asthma will have to push to exhale and it would take more than 1 sec. This is not an exact test but it should give yo a rough idea. If the symptoms can't be explained by asthma or just being out of shape, some possible causes of the symptoms include: a heart defect, anemia, or a thyroid problems.
You will look somewhat slimmer but as a side note theres no way your a size 10 at 225. I weigh 118 and wear a 6 so yeah. But by losing the weight you will look better but yeah.
female 5'7" and size 10 slacks, what brand?? I am hip heavy but only 135 and wear 10s
Not much, considering it's just barely of your weight.
You will still be a 200lbs fat pig.
It's fair to say that most of the stereotypes associated with certain races hold some truth. You have probably experienced situations that made you hate blacks. Nothing wrong with that.
at least it's not very good, and it's too bad if you live in the US

they make it hard to like them.their are some good ones.you know the ones that work and pay taxes. but then they do still use the race card

I feel the need to go every 30 min and when I do I have difficulty starting a stream. Once I finally do start urinating it lasts very small time 3 seconds at most. Should I get this checked out by a doctor? Im worried about the medical price in the U.S I have not had any intercourse or nor have a used any drugs so if anyone knows what I could have please respond
I would get it checked out. Although, you havent had interiors recently, you could still have a urinary tract infection. It's common among women and could lead to a kidney infection if not treated. Trust me, you don't want it to lead to that. Also, drink some cranberry juice. Very healthy for you and it helps with UTI's.
Drink LOTS of pure water to reduce the chances of infection. See a doc!
sounds like prostrate trouble go see a doctor
Go to the doctor.
After or not at all. Bath water is nowhere close to being sterile. Getting bath water into an open blister can cause infection.
after
After you get out when it is softened. But be sure to dry it well and apply a bandage if necessary..
yes
Everyone seems to say it's because you're stressed/busy but I'm exactly the same, and I'll literally be lying around all day ay doing nothing. Basically I don't get hungry or ever think about eating and usually my mum will remind me to eat. And then by dinner I'll have had barely anything and i end up feeling sick eating such a large quantity at once. Sorry this isn't really an answer lol but I'm really curious to find out the same thing. Maybe because you've missed meals before and you're body has become used to it somehow.
Get on a schedule, take snacks with you. Take a good whole food multivitamin. Getting to the point you are shaky is terrible for your body. Sounds like low blood sugar but you can actually cause hormonal imbalance, slow your metabolism way down and create other issues by doing this frequently. It is stress to your body to get to that point. Your body may even react by storing more fat and burning muscle tissue even when you do go to eat normally. As for the reason WHY you don't feel hungry? Perscription medication could be the reason or some other medical condition.
As person who focuses on school, videogames, and exercise, I tend to skip eating a lot. I also have severe depression so I fall asleep and skip meals. Sometimes I dry hurl when I'm hungry but don't notice. Busy people forget to eat. Because of depression, im used to neglecting my body. Eat small snacks frequently during your day, and if hunger doesn't get bad at mealtimes, eat anyway but not too much to avoid starvation or getting too full. I hope this helps.
Fix a time in the morning, afternoon and evening and make the time to eat something. I didn't eat for 3 days after a traumatic experience and on the third day, got out of bed and fell down cos my legs wouldn't hold my weight. A glass of milk made me feel better and then I began to eat more. Stress or a traumatic event (loss, moving house, relationship breakdown etc) are typical reasons for not eating. Also feelings of worthlessness. Worth looking into if it persists.
I would schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Show them what you have written here and use that as a basis for having a frank discussion on how you are doing. They can do a full physical and neurological workup to rule out medical issues that may be causing or contributing to how you are feeling. They can refer you to a mental health professional that can evaluate your mental state. Once the test results are in, treatment options can be discussed. Make sure you are eating well also. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...
This may sound simplistic, but it sounds like you're not actually getting hungry, even though your body needs nutrients. If you were hungry, then you would KNOW it. There's a variety of health reasons why you may not have a good appetite. Thyroid, liver disease, diabetes. Maybe you should be checked out.
Don't worry. At least you'll be skinny and not fat like me. I feel hungry all the time. If I eat a big meal I feel hungry after only one hour. You'll be fine. Be thin and win!
I don't know why but the best thing to do is set specific meal times and stick to them. Maybe you're in a med which suppresses appetite or maybe you're depressed. I hardly ate when I was depressed.
That's a UTI (Urinary Tract Infection). It helps to drink plenty of Cranberry juice as well as water. There is medication you can get from a pharmacy (in the UK at least) *if* you know more about the infection but as this seems to be the first time you've had the problem*, you should go and see your doctor. (*otherwise you'd know what it was and would not be on here asking 'what's wrong?')
You my dear, have a Urinary Tract Infection, I'm sure. Drink a lot of water, and do not resist the urge to urinate. Go pee when you feel you need to. It will work it's way out of your system.
Yes go to the doctor it will just get worse but f Ir now drink alot of water & cranberries juice & go to walmart & get these pills call AZos they will help get ride of it & help the pain when you pee but honestly i would go to the doctor just to be safe . Hope you get better i hate uti
Sounds like a urinary tract infection (UTI). These are fairly common. You need to see the doctor who will probably give you antibiotics. Drink lots of water.
you might have a urinary tract infection among other things - go to a doctor
Urinary tract infection
I don't know
UTI, go to the doctor.
Diet literally means "what you eat". Many people use the term "go on a diet" when they want to lose weight, when what they are really doing is CHANGING their current diet to be more healthy and/or contain less calories.
Diet actually means to eat less AND healthy
Your 'diet' is simply what you eat. (Noun) To diet (verb) means you alter what you normally eat to lose weight and/or become more healthy.
it means a little of both
No, this is not normal. Be sure to contact your gyno dr soon for an appointment. You may have uterine fibroids and/or polyps causing your very heavy/dark periods and clotting (or other issue). Many women have fibroids that do not cuase issues, but sometimes they do and should be addressed by a medical professional sooner (in next few weeks/months) rather than later (several months/years).
Lots of clots are never normal.. but lots of girls (and even grown women) on yahoo seem to confuse blood clots with pieces of uterine lining, which actually are normal since the entire purpose of a period is to shed the uterine lining so it is normal to see bits if tissue in the blood
For me it was normal but my doctor said it was not good. I'm on birth control and hoping that it helps. Because I had lots of blood, super heavy flow, tons of cramps, and lots of clots
Please try to make ginger and brown sugar drink whenever you period start ! Just smash the ginger and boil it for 15-20 mins then add the brown sugar( sweetest is depend on your favour) .. It will improve moreover brown sugar can replenish your iron which was discharge from the flow !
Normal and natural
You should be asking a doctor sweetie. Good luck.
It's from a build_up of semen against the lining of the uterus, nothing to worry about.
Yes, it is most likely early stage of vaginal cancer.
it's nirmal
i think you are having a miscarriage
It sounds unlikely to be schizophrenia due to symptoms and things but it does sound a lot more like a type of OCD or anxiety disorder so try looking at them (Internet research or youtube videos *Katie morton is the best*) but don't get to upset and panic about it ask for help and advice from a doctor or adult you trust to find out for sure these are what you are struggling with.
I don't think that classifies as schizophrenia. That would be short term memory loss. Similar to Dory in Finding Nemo. If it's something that happens every once and a while, it happens to all of us if we have other things on our mind. If it's something that happens a lot and one time after another like checking the door 4 or more times, it's probably an issue to talk to a doctor about.
Not at all schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder where a person believes everyone is out to get them and can lead to dangerous situations if not treated properly. I tend to do things what you do myself it's more OCD if not anything else: But f you're bothered by it talk to your parents and see if they can admit you to help or something.
Sounds like OCD. Nothing like schizophrenia. You don't have any hallucinations or delusions however the example you just said is a text book scenario of OCD
That's not schizophrenia. You may have some short-term memory or working memory problem, but it's not schizophrenia. A psychiatrist can test you for memory issues. And treat any memory issues. Most specialty doctors require referrals from your primary doctor. So, ask. Write it down so you remember.
Not schizophrenia. You might be OCD, though. (Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder). Ask your doctor.
No. Not even close. That's actually pretty normal for a lot of people. Even OCD is much more severe than that.
Ocd sounds terrible I would get so annoyed at myself.God bless or whoeve controls this planet these people with mental illnesses!
Yeah, sounds more like OCD.
The father can voice his opinions and talk with the mother, but should NOT get the final say. Not his body, not his choice. Should the woman get to have the final say on if a man has his junk cut off? No? Okay then. Fair is fair
No I do not support late term abortions. They are barbaric. However I do not believe a man should have any say. It's not heir bodies and it's not "their baby." We are finally out of the dark ages where a man had to give he doctor consent To operate on his wife. It wasn't that long ago. WE ARE NOT ANY MAN'S PROPERTY.
The "Selfish actions" of your "Partner" goes BOTH WAYS. The fact that she doesn't want to abort is a Good Thing. SEX Comes with consequences. Not ready for a baby? Take the correct precautions.
i think that when it comes to pregnancy it should be up to the woman. afterall, she is the one who's going to be carrying the damn thang. however, if she doesn't want to abort it, but the man isn't ready/doesn't want to have a kid right now then the woman should have no right to be liable to get child support off him. that's not right. but i don't think the guy should be able to push a woman into having a abortion.
The father can just give up his paternal rights..
I think all humans should be able to beat their meat if they really want to.
After 16 men do not grow. Either you measured yourself incorrectly or you are lying. It's that simple. Stretching has no effect whatever on height at any age.
You can't grow later in life. You've reached your maximum adult height by the time you reach 18 or 19. How much difference do you honestly think one extra inch will make to your life?
Can't happen. You might look taller if you lost weight/improved your posture
Troll. No one can possibly grow that late in life. It's physically impossible.
So it's been almost 2 years now that I've had acne it's pretty mild-moderate tho nothing really that crazy. Using lemon overnight really helped me but hasn't really shown much improvement over the last few weeks. So I bought neutrogenas oil free acne face wash and grapefruit acne moisturizer. The moisturizer irrates my skin as I have to rub it in so I quit that. I only use lemon over night and face wash before it for the last week and things are getting worse. I have so many small pimples on my forehead and some in random spots. Nothing seems to work and it really affects my self esteem. Help?
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming?

These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I know what you are going through. There are so many products that guarantee that they will take acne away. After spending a lot of money and time with their bullshit lies, the only thing that worked for me and has continued to work is bevoline. It's a grey and blue box and it is made by skin divine.
I think my situation may have been similar once. When I first got braces my teeth hurt like f**k. You should avoid hard foods, such as raw vegetables. If the pain is unbearable, you could try taking an asprin for temporary relief. You could also try "chewing" the food with your tongue, if it's soft enough. What I did (although I don't recommend it) was swallow my food whole, up to the size of an ice cube. Anyway, I wish you luck in your endeavor.
Only eat really soft and most likely fluid-ish foods like soup. Do not eat too hot or too cold as your mouth is sensitive at the time. Soft foods that are usually cold like yogurt, i dont think so. Just cooked and really warm soup, wait for it. Soup with big chunks- might have to swallow it so no fun.
Sip on some warm soup or other such drinks. You will feel like eating in a day or so, but in the meantime have plenty of liquids, and some soft foods such as jello, pudding, yogurt.
Take some paracetamol and ibuprofen. Soup, porridge and smoothies are cool!
It's hard for me to poop I have pain and feel nauceous. It all started two days ago on the first day of my period. I looked in my underwear and the pad was still there but i'm scared this happened. I've pooped a few times since then but i'm still scared, would it have just slipped up there or would it have had to be forced? Like could this have happened without me noticing?
it would have too be forced up there
You should visit a Physician. If there is a pad up your butt it can lead to blood poisoning.
You dont want Shi* answers to your Shi* question? Okay, go find another way to get attention rather than taking up the space in a hospital that someone else actually needs. Go find a therapy group or something and act ridiculous there. Oh mah gawd I'm soooo friggin fat I need to waste everyone's time and spend the night in a hospital with no legit reasons. Please, starve yourself and climb into your freezer. That should get you to the hospital.
You need to be hospitalised in the kind of hospital that has straitjackets and padded walls.

It means your lymph node is swollen, for some reason.
You have larger lymph nodes than normal.
Ask your doctor but when I had same scan done because of swollen lumph node all it showed was thyroid problems, blood tests then showed underactive thyroid
Ask your doctor for an interpretation of the results, but it might mean that your lymph nodes are swollen or enlarged.
Ask the doctor who ordered the MRI.

Yes, most definitely. Your penis at 5 1/2 inches is completely normal and your girth of 6 inches is bigger than average. It will definitely be enough and satisfy.
5.5inches length is bigger than about 50% of guys and 6 inch girth is bigger than by far most guys, since average girth is only about 4.5 - 4.9 inches so it may even be too much for a 4'9 girl
Girth is huge so may be difficult to have sex with her. Length is above average.
Depends on her pu*ssy. Genitals are not correlated to height, yet... Your size is average. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Yes your average sized for an adult.
the thin ones can take a lot of meat
Depends how you use it, dunnit. Won't know til you try. > M
Yes,it is enough.
ask her, how the hell could we know such a personal thing?
the two of you will be fine
Well, save some money so than in 6 months when your cancer progresses, you can get into chemo and pay for surgery. You can not cure yourself of cancer. It just can't be done. Steve Jobs tried, and he had way more money and access to the foods that are supposed the help, and he died of cancer. So good luck but keep in touch with your doctors. You are going to need them.
Many types of biological therapy are available only in clinical trials. Biological therapy for cancer is a very active area of cancer research. It's treatment in ALL...
You know the chemo worked in the past so go for it again and save money and if it doesnt work then use money for other treatment, Good Luck
Have you looked into immunotherapy? I can't be certain, but I think some types leukemias responds well to it. I'll be praying for you!
the BEST holistic approach to cancer treatment has less than HALF the success rate of the WORST chemo. not going with chemo is essentially a death wish
It doesn't work, you'll die. I know how unpleasant chemo is, but it's your best bet. Good luck.
Do you think they where marijuana brownies?. Maybe she gave them to you as a jok. But i do not have any experience with marijuana so probably not.
Yes, that's it. It'll pass in an hour or so, then you'll be really hungry, but don't eat more brownies, eat a sandwich and some chips. Just sit quietly until you feel better
I guess it would depend on what was in them. If you know of any allergies you have ask your friend what they put in it. Make sure they arnt weed brownies too. Keep checking for any other signs of allergic reactions.
What are you trying to cure? Oily skin or breakouts? If you have acne, you need to see a dermatologist. A face wash just isn't going to cure this medical condition. Rather than spend a ton of money on useless washes and toners, and rather than spending months or years suffering, see a physician. See the dermatologist. He will give you a prescription for an acne treatment. Ask for a recommendation on a face wash at that point. Good Luck
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
At the moment I can't go to the dermatologist and I'm having a similar problem so if you do find a solution let me know : )
Yes
No no no. I had awful acne for years I cleaned it up by changing my diet. You could be allergic to dairy or yeast. Sudocreme at night !!!
eat more fruit/veg, drink water, lower greasy/sugary food intake and use things like manuka honey, aloe vera or coconut oil on your face

A Big FAT NO.... Got a problem, go to the doctors...no Doctors here. Only RAWR's.....
When you go to a doctor, have tests done, then you can get diagnosed.
Only a doctor who sees you in his office can tell you.
I think they are using cancer as a metaphor for someone who is very unwelcome.
don't try it, they never will look like women's
It was true of Castrati who were castrated at puberty. Might not work at later age. < M
Try it and let us know how it turns out.
LOL wow where did you read this at I find it interesting.
not sure, i dont know anyone that is nutless

Don't be! The majority of women (around 80%) have stretch marks. Heck, I never even gained a lot of weight and got a ton of them. I am small petite and am covered in them. It is okay. It is apart of you. There is nothing to be ashamed of.
Start using Bio-Oil on your skin , you will see a great improvement in about 5 weeks .
Unless you swim Nude, nobody is going to see your stretch marks.
Cut them off!
Wear a swimming costume......
Why, are you going to the beach topless? If not, what's the problem?
Presume you will be wearing a bra, so how can they be seen?
Become a lesbian.
There are plenty that treat both.... if you have both then they should be able to give you just one. Sometimes you need more than one medication depending on what your issue are. I am on 5..... I have Bipolar 1.... I take Lithium, Doxepin, Rexulti, Clonazepam, and Lunesta.... Depends on what you need.
It depends on the type of medication and the severity of the anxiety/depression. Some meds will make the anxiety worse.
Some medications help with both. I take separate medications for each, but my case is fairly severe.
They should help.
I am 13 and I mastrabate (sinse I was 12). I feel guilty about it after the fact but it feels good. And I tried to talk to my mum about the fact I mastrabate, (I wanted to know where I could buy loob) and I got grownded for the fact I mastrabate. Am I A dirty person for mastrabating? Is there any way I can talk to my mum, (btw I asked my mum what mastrabating was at 12 and got yelled at so I looked it up and tryed it) I also don't mind you telling me where I could get loob at 13
Completely normal for young people to examine their bodys from a young age. Your mum could just be concerned that your experimenting young. But there is no shame what so ever, it could be your mum's embarrassment or doesn't know how to approach it. As for the lube and supermarket do it under the brand name Durex normally down the drugs isle.
okay, masturbation is 100% natural - but it is definitely not something you talk to your mom about. That is something you generally figure out for yourself. Don't feel bad - almost everyone does it.
Masturbation is normal. But you don't need lube anyway. Don't put anything inside yourself, just rub your clitoris.
It's very normal at your age.
completely normal and helps to keep your prostate healthy.
yes , It is ok. No worry.
Oh, do not worry!!! Absolutely nothing will happen to you! It will take longer to digest than food does, of course, but you'll never know it's happening, honest! We've all swallowed gum . . . it feels weird going down, but that's easily fixed by just eating a bite of something. You're fine! :-)
Nothing will happen. Kids have accidentally swallowed gum since it was invented.
Haha, you will be fine, but the gum will stay inside your body for about 7 years, it's okay one time I was laughing so hard I swallowed my gum lol, but you will be fine :)
Its completely fine. You wont digest it for the next 7 years probs tho xd. But its all okay I have swallowed many of those in my life lol
Absolutely nothing will happen to you! It will take longer to digest than food does, of course, but you'll never know it's happening, honest
A gum tree will grow inside of you
don't worry the gum will pass like everything else because of your stomach acid
sooner or later the gum will cause major organ damage. you will need surgery. if I were you, I'd arrange funeral services, you don't have much time
I smoke camel crush cigarettes (i rarely crush the filter though), ive beem smoking for a little over a month now, and I dont smoke too much. I only smoke about a pack a week. When I first started smoking I just felt really great and lightheaded, now I just feel sick to my stomach after smoking and during smoking. Why? Is this normal? How do I make it stop so I can just get the lightheaded feeling without feeling nauseous (dont bother saying quit). Help?
Whats the point of smoking if you're not enjoying it? Just go for a w@nk instead. In the 21st century, have a one off the wrist is more socially acceptable, and lowers the chance of prostate cancer in men
try not to smoke try ecigs the helped me
You'd be used to having things shoved down your throat, wouldn't you? You crazy little sh't. Your brain is mutilated, lobotomy gone way wrong. And you do have AIDs, and Rabies, Tristan. All those orgies you had with goats and Arabs must have caused it. And what sort of ******** parent calls their kid "Tristan" and doesn't take them to mental hospital if all they talk about is circumcision? And no, it shouldn't be banned. It certainly shouldn't be banned based on your false narrative either. I reckon you're so defensive about being uncircumcised because you know deep down that your d'ck is ugly and smelly and the 'extra sensitivity' was just made up to justify you smelling of tunah.
its a legitimate medical procedure so no, theres no need for a ban though it should no more be done on infants for the sake of tradition than every child having their tonsils removed
"nuff said" implies that you're some kind of authority. You're not. One thing we can be certain of is that you have no idea how much pleasure my cut c0ck gives me. Less certain, but likely, is that you've got a foreskin fetish.
no it shouldn't and it should be a decision the guy makes
Oh God. "Stop shoving it down our throats".
I was horny. I jerked off and ***. Now for the next day or two, I am not horny, and my dick is soft. I don t feel good about it. I wish I had not *** last night, but I was so horny; I had to do it. I like the feeling of being horny, charged, feel alive. But ejaculating gets away that feeling for a day or two or more! Hate that. Is this feeling common for men?
Not at all, may have just had an intense climax and ejaculation that made your muscles so taunt you are sore. Or could be something unrelated to ejaculating. Look around at guys you see every morning, probably 1/4 of them ejaculated before you saw them that morning-- they are fine. Masturbation is just solo sex, so should not cause any lingering effects you describe. Most adult males you see have sex regularly, and of course nearly all teen males ejaculate nearly every day. All do fine.
That is just your hormones screwing around with you. Normally after ejaculating, men feel relieved and relaxed. What you are experiencing sounds like your hormones are all over the place and your body is trying to cope. You should go back to normal soon. It will be off and on until you become an adult, and your hormones stabilize.
I think you're confused. Ejaculation does not cause any type of problem like that. You are obviously suffering from something. But it's not because of masturbation. LOL
<br>https://mobile.lens.com/contact-lenses/p-ufmek/o2-optix/?mkwid=saIYF27NM_dm&amp;pcrid=67425447604&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=&amp;productid=V19-394&amp;gclid=CLeEs47cvMwCFQZZhgodCJMCTA?mkwid=saIYF27NM_dm&amp;pcrid=67425447604&amp;pkw=&amp;pmt=&amp;productid=V19-394&amp;gclid=CLeEs47cvMwCFQZZhgodCJMCTA#<br> ^^ I am planning on getting these Optics O2 (disposable) contact lenses, one box for right eye, another for left. I want to use them only for special occasions. For example, so far, I'm planning to use them on graduation and Eid. What do these boxes come with, just the lenses or with the contact holder thing (the two circle containers with the letter R and L. Sorry dont really know the name haha) and with the contact cleaning solution? Is the expiration date usually within a month, a year? My parents are really cheap and getting these are already pushing it.
Those are monthly disposable lenses. They don't come with a case. You get that at a drugstore along with Multi-Purpose Solution . Wearing them part time means each pair is good for 2 months. Unopened lenses are good for 3 or 4 years while in the package. There is an expiry date on the box which is for the Unopened lenses. Monthly lenses are good for 30 days wear OR 60 days after opening, which ever comes first. If you live in the US , you won't be able to order those without a prescription from an eye Dr.
Its just the lenses in their packaging and thats it. They don't really expire its just a matter of fluid in the packet protecting the lenses so the fluid may dry up eventually.. Use it within 6 months imo
ok
Bra: I was about 13 when I finally started wearing real bras even though I was very flat chested. Period: it started off as light brown and didn't come back for 7 months. Boyfriend: 14 and never had one! Although I have been talking to a guy which is so unusual for me because I have always been the one that was I guess a little bit pretty but guys still never talked to me! Shaving: I was 12 and had crazy hairy legs. I had to beg my mom for like a whole year and one day we set it up and she ran to the store and taught me how to shave in the bathtub.
first bra, 15 years old - bought it at H&M, period 15 years old. Woke up feeling like I wet the bed, stood up and liquid just dropped all over my legs and the floor. I cleaned it up, put on a pad, then went back to bed. boyfriend - age, 16.5 - friends for a year, he liked me, chased me for 2 months, then I kissed him and we ended up dating for 2 years Shaving - just started when my hair started growing. Took a razor and voila - job done
No, I do not Sydney. You may simply be dealing with commonly experienced symptoms of cerebral palsy, a permanent disability. Or one of about 60 other things. Not a day in 32 years has gone by in my life where I DON'T have that. Tell your parent or guardian how you feel. You have quite a few symptoms it looks like, judging by your question history.
Possibly due to your diet of junk food and sodas... Your lack of daily rigorous exercise... And your poor sleep habits. Lifestyle Changes may do you a world of good bro. Think about it.
Probably Stratega or one of the other deadly medications that will be a class action law suit in another year.
You may have a vitamin D deficiency!
No, but your doctor would.
The wastes in the water you discharge are more concentrated since there is less water being discarded to dilute the waste products. Just like your first pee in the morning will tend to be darker- more waste products accumulated since you had not peed for a long time. And then when dehydrated, just the opposite- more waste and less water equals darker pee.
Yes; and when you don't urinate often enough. Drink more fluid - does not have to be all water but not all the same thing either.
The waste is more concentrated because it does not have water to dilute it.
because it has less water in it
Very healthy!
Sounds good. Lots of nutritious food. Make sure some of your meals have some fresh veggies too.
NO POTATOES. Good grief.. Why on earth would you eat two starches when you're trying to lose weight?
All are fine, but I would chose one potato.
Pretty heavy on the carbs there.
Your penis is more than likely done growing since you are 15. But your penis size is perfectly normal and average.
You're running out of time. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16.
Likely done, most guys finish by 15 in length, girth by 16. But above adult average of 5.16
Used these Prolargentsize as directed and in just 2 weeks both me and my girlfriends noticed increase of length and width next time. I will definitely purchase 2 to 3 bottles instead of just one. very amazing product flawless.
There is no valid reason for such fears. If you take adequate care of your health and physical fitness, it will grow as usual. Don't believe quacks who give big promises to enlarge it.
No. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
if I did I couldn't answer this question
No
no i have not. yes i did
At the beginning of the week (sunday and monday) I dropped into a really depressed mood, it was really bad, and I thought about dying, because I thought it would be better and easier, because what s the point of living... Why was I having those thoughts? The depression only lasted a couple days and ended by Tuesday.
Whenever you feel that way, distract yourself. No matter what it is- work, television, cooking, whatever you can think of. Call up a friend and ask them to hang out with you. Do something that shoves those thoughts to the back of your mind. You could try over the counter anti-depressants, if you want to go the medication route. I completely understand if you don't want to talk to anyone about it, as it can be hard to talk about, especially with some strange therapist you've never met. But, if you're okay with talking about it, tell a close friend or family member first, then work your way from there.
Right down a list of things that you would like to live for it it's seeing the world or something 😊
I'm only 16 so I don't know much, but I can tell you that if you talk to someone, for me at least, I always feel that helps. And I know it might be awkward or whatever, but once you just blurt it out and get it out there, you WILL feel better. Just talk to someone you love.
How old are you?mcould this be a case of normal adolescent mood swings?
Girth is what we like. It puts more pressure on our lady parts. Also angle and positioning are important. Eight inches will not go all the way in, since the aroused woman's vagina is only between 4-5 inches long. (My source is WebMd.). The sensitive G-spot area is only 2-3 inches from the vaginal entrance, so 6" will definitely feel great and do the job! Hope this helps.
Few girls can hold a full 8 inches- 6 inches is full depth for many girls-- so not much advantage being 8 inches or more other than bragging rights.
6 is good for me, 8 is really pushing it, but like others said, girth matters the most. I'll take 6" any day of the week with a guy who knows what he's doing though. Just another reason I love older guys--they're experienced.
Dude you should be grateful. I'm pushing 5 inches over here and that's giving myself a couple extra quarter inches
Depends on your technique, my brother... put pressure on her clit with the base of a six incher, and she'll feel more than a guy with an eight incher who has no idea what he's doing. Interesting note, a bigger penis is not more attractive to females in parts of the animal kingdom https://www.mistermanpower.net/blog/a-bi...
Yes, it feels as good as 8 inch feels. Length is not the matter of feeling good, but it is width.
The penis needs to keep contact with her clitoris during thrusting in her vagina. 6 inches will do just as well as 8 inches, when the guy understands how orgasms are stimulated.
When we were in our twenties, my fiance and eventual wife loved that I was well endowed. That however is no longer the case. What was fun then is now only a source of pain for her. I'd say that a less thick and shorter thingy would be bringing both of us more pleasure now.
For me size never really mattered, but I've only had intercourse with a couple of guys. I will say it's pretty exciting visually though. And yeah with my little experience older guys seem to be better, more control and all.
Yes. More contact with the side walls of the vagina is better than the penis just being long. Girth is better.
During WWI the Germans experienced a severe shortage of morphine for their mobile army surgical hospitals where amputations were being performed on a regular basis. They turned to coffee retention enemas and found they greatly reduced pain for those in recovery which freed up all their supply of morphine for the operating room. Those retention enemas also have a cancer fighting effect which has been implemented in cancer treatment centers (by Dr. Max Gerson and others). The pain killing effects really kick in after several daily uses, less so if only tried one time.
Turmeric has been proven to reduce or eliminate pain better than leading prescription medications. What is unique about turmeric is that it combats inflammation through both of these mechanisms.... simultaneously! Its multi-pronged approach allows it to work wonders for aches, pains, and arthritis (by stopping inflammation at the source), while also strongly supporting the immune system with antioxidants. And because nearly all diseases and ailments can be traced back to inflammation and oxidative stress…it seem like there’s almost nothing that turmeric can’t heal. See the article

I like saunas and massage.
Poor people eat each other you know. One day Bob says hi to Scott and CHOMP! Bob is now in Scott. This is how poor people get fat. Disgusting creatures actually.
Food does not cost that much compared to other expenses. Poor people are stressed, so they may tend to eat for comfort. I can relate, my elderly parents both died in the past year and I gained some weight coming to terms with that. Losing it now.
I guess those people aren't really poor like you describe. But the thing is the cost of food is so low and there is so much of it available that its quite easy for people who have an emotional connection to food to put on weight.
i was asking the doctor this yesterday and he said that when someone eat one meal per day the body will store it automatically as fat because the metabolism is so slow it can't burn the fat so they are stored for the main reason that poor people don't eat frequently and that one meal is stored as fat
Foods like chocolate crisps chips and other fatty foods dont cost as much and last alot longer then fruit and vegetables do so instead of eating a healthy lifestyle they dont because unhealthy food is alot cheaper
Too much fat
They are poor because they spent all their money on food
I don't know know if i would cheat tbh. I never been in a relationship
No. I've never cheated. I've been cheated on and it sucks.
No, because that's against morals and religion
i am not cheap so i can never cheat
No, never. Because that's not me. That's why.
BP will change greatly in just a few minutes. Wait about 15 minutes and take another reading. If your average over about a week is still high, you need to see a doctor. If you are overweight, you need to loose weight.
Exercise
Too high. Get reading Dr's office. Probably need meds. Maybe, lifestyle change. We aren't doctors. Eat way less if obese. Add fiber. Walk daily.
See the web site of Caldwell Esselstyn. Also, Douglas J. Lisle is interesting.
medication. exercise. cardio
What you need to do is find a job. Any job, **** volunteer. Keeping busy will get you out of your own head and it will help you met people(perhaps friends)
get a job, go to college, gives you an idea.
How about... go to school or get a job? Maybe?
get job/car/own place. then you'll be even with everyone else.
When you get the bumps you're probably using a crappy cheap razor or a razor which isn't brand new. Once a razor is used, it has a jagged edge. You can't physically see that the blades are worn, but they are and this is irritating to our skin.
Shaving rash. It's common. Wax instead.
it's from you removing the hair and from not taking your time and doing it right
shaving is silly
Icebag it. Frozen peas might work. Just apply for a few seconds at a time. I guess it will recover. < M
Consult to a doctor
in a few hours you'll be fine
u need to see a doctor and tell him about it
Yup. Avoid White Flour Products, White Sugar, White Rice, and White Potatoes. Enjoy Whole Grains, Vegetables, Fruit, Protein, and Low fat dairy. I lost 20 pounds this way.
Seeing the natural ingredients and that it was caffeine free I got a bad figuring why not. I am not to much overweight and a big tea drinker so I could easily slip it in my normal routine. I was impressed over the increased bowel movements it gave me. I also enjoyed the taste promoting me to keep drinking it simply because I liked the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . Then after a week I noticed weight starting to drop off. I guess all those masses clogging my intestines are finally out of my system. Feels good to be clean inside.
Yes, it's possible (unless you are already skinny). Cut sugars and grains and anything processed, like cereals, muffins, low-fat dairy.
I know I m probably over exaggerating but i had sex for the first time on Saturday, May 7th (last weekend) and it s now Thursday, May 12th. I should have gotten my period on Sunday and it s NEVER late. We used protection but apparently it rolled off but he put the condom back on. I know it hasn t even been a week but I ve been having really bad anxiety, i don t want to be pregnant. I m really young! I m so scared, for the first time I actually want my period to get here, just so I know! Please someone help me get some answers.
You messed up. If you weren't using birth control, you could be pregnant. If you're too young to be pregnant, you're too young to have sex. Go to the drugstore and get a early detection pregnancy test and find out.
Anxiety can cause a delay along ith a lot of other things. Wait another week. You can always get a pregnancy test kit . Not sure what the time frame is for it to be accurate. I'm sure it tells on the box.
Don't worry
I wouldn't panic too much yet love. When a girl becomes sexually active it will mess with her menstrual cycle .. wait another week
It's exactly because we could not give our first girlfriends orgasms that we now come here to answer questions to help the next generation. Many girls post questions about how guys feel about things like labia shape, breast shape, odor, etc. Most of the time they have the total opposite feeling from how boys think. I rarely answer questions if the poster asks for girl response only.
I only answer because I have been a nurse for 20 years.
I'm an OB/GYN
Sustainable weight loss is neither fast nor easy. Proper diet, exercise daily. Up it to at least 30 minutes daily.
So the last time I cut was Nov. 2014! Then last night, I broke it. I've been feeling very low and I did it. I feel so stupid and weak for doing it and now I'm just so ashamed that I'm heading down that road again. I don't want that but can someone please help me how to be happy. I'm trying so hard but I keep having mental breakdowns and ugh )':
Every time you want to cut your self do something instead. For example. Put down the Kings or sharp object and take a nap. Or drive somewhere where you can just let your thoughts be free. Or simple just watch the to get your mind off cutting. Don't feel ashamed we all have those moments I have had a lot. Have you tried talking to a therapist? Maybe try that and try throwing out anything that you can get your hands on that would cut your self. Just keep your head up and try some of he things I said hopefully it helps.
Go online and find the phone numbers for cutting/self-harm hotlines. Call them when you are tempted to cut. They are free and confidential, so they are safe to talk to. And they are specially trained to help people in your exact situation.
Day 4 I still haven't pooped. It still hurts and its teasing me. I keep crowning but that's as far as it will go. I can literally feel all the poop in my back and my butt. It hurts so much. I think there's rips and tears in my butthole. My question is when do I know its actually safe enough to go to the bathroom? It feels like I have to use it every minute but nothing but pain is coming. As soon as it starts hurting I immediately jump off the toilet and stand up and start crying. I really need help. Water and stool softener isn't helping!!!
If this is real, I would have been to the doctor 3 days ago. Either just push it out, reach up there and try to pull it out, or get the doc to do it. Just make sure you bring a book of matches with you when that big nugget finally comes out. Hoo-wee!
Girl don't poop
You may have to stick your finger up your butt hole and pull the first bit out. Then take some Metamucil for the next few days. Hope you poo soon.
go to the doctor, maybe they give you an enema, long delay like this dries out the excrement and makes it more difficult to pass
drink more water, take a laxative already and going forward, more water, less soda, less crap food, more fiber
My head feels like it's in a pressure cooker or under a bell jar. I feel like I'm losing myself like I'm not me I'm a shell of I'm someone else and I can't really remember who I am. It's not all the time it comes and goes. I fixate on a fictional character and sometimes feel like I am him instead of me. I have been diagnosed anxiety and depression before. Could this be a personality disorder or some type of PTSD?
I'd like to humbly suggest a dietary change. Cut out all gluten and sugar and starchy foods, and see if it doesn't all just disappear. And add a good B complex supplement. B's enable us to handle stress. You might consider taking a niacinamide supplement as well. (Not niacin.....niacinAMIDE.) Often a lack of B's, the niacinamide one in particular, can cause all sorts of odd thoughts, nightmares, strange perceptions, etc.
If this is interfering with your daily life, and it sounds like it is, go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
If you feel constant pressure in your head, you might be experiencing a chronic migraine. A neurologist that specializes in headaches should be able to diagnose and treat you.
The best source of fats is ground flax seeds. The trouble with fish and fish oil is the extensive amount of pollution in addition to unhealthy fats and cholesterol. The best complex carb sources are minimally processed whole food plant based sources such as vegetables, whole grains, fruits, and legumes.
The best source for complex carbs would be barley, green peas, whole-wheat bread etc. The best sources of healthy fats are fish, nuts like almonds, cashews and walnuts, peanut butter etc.
Beans, garbanzos, lentils are excellenet complex carbs. Nuts, fish (salmon), and avocados are excellent healthy fats.
no dude she just don't wanna swallow ur ***
Semen is almost pure protein. So, I do not think swallowing it would make one fat. On the other hand, I think it is unreasonable of you to even want her to swallow it. She may not like the texture. What difference does it make whether she swallows it or not?
How stupid is this question lol, no you can't get fat swallowing semen.
It won't make her fat. Seriously though, why do you care? I've never cared if they swallowed or spit. As long as they get it out of me, they can frame it for all I give a ****.
No, it's yummy, has a bit of protein I think. Won't hurt to swallow ***.
Stop posting juvenile questions
nonsense
This is a very unrealistic body goal and will do more damage than good. I'm assuming you are very young due to this goal. If you want to lose weight, set small goals. So first aim for 5 pounds. Cut out soft drink. Only drink water. Within 1 week you will notice a difference in your body. Also cut out processed foods as much as you can. I cook all of my own meals, i drink only water, i don't eat processed snacks etc. And I have lost over 40 pounds in 4 months. This is a huge amount to lose in such a small amount of time.
Eat 80 calories and lose 40 lbs an d you'll soon find yourself losing weight very quickly. That usually happens when you die and rot
You will die if you lose 40 pounds. You weigh what you should weight. You cannot live on 80 calories. You are anorexic. Get treatment. It's a slow form of suicide.
I recently started a diet, and i knew i needed something to give me that extra push. So i went a head and ordered Weight Loss Green Store Tea .since using it i don't feel as hungry and feel more energetic. So far ive lost 10 pounds in a week and a half. I'm loving my results.
Please tell me you are not serious. You are completely normal weight for your age. If you want to be leaner though, just eat regularly and do strengthening exercises. Did you know a 135lb lean women can look thinner than a 125 lb average woman??? Don't go off the scale, go based on how you feel, and don't make the mistake of thinking that skinny is going to make you happy - it won't. Please watch this video - it show's the "ideal" body is NOT skinny but embracing a little bit of your curves, give or take country to country.
110lbs=50kg for 1m55 and you want to lose 40lbs=18kg to get to 70lbs=32kg ??? Did I understand correctly ??? Well, if you reach this weight you will just die of course. You will even die *before* having reached that objective. Btw, if you eat only 80kcal a day from May 20th to July 11th (once again, have I correctly understood?), you'll very very probably die too.
I forgot to mention that I'm starting on May 20th 2016 and I am really wanting to lose the weight by July 11th
first off don't starve yourself, if you do then your body would hold on to any fat on your body. And i don't think its really healthy to loose over 40 pounds in only two two months. Just make sure to eat right and exercise, then you'll be fine.
You're not overweight at 110.
losing weight is a combination of how many calories you eat verses how many calories you burn with exercise
Exercise
Gymnastics!
Go outside and play, for Christ's sake.
dirt and exercise same as everyone else
You weigh 1200 lbs? Even a muscle building diet means eating 1-2 g of protein per lb of body weight per day. You're eating at least 5-6 g per lb. Chicken and powder is the only way you'll get 1200 g, and even then it's not realistic. Even mass gainers only have like 40-60 g per scoop. You'll have to have like 5-10 two scoop shakes a day.
1,200 grams of protein?! I hope you are nowhere near anybody for the next few days. You will be farting and crapping your brains out.
sooo you weigh 1200 lbs? one gram for every pound you weight
WRONG. Whatever calculation you`ve made, it`s incorrect.
well if you're talking about 1 CHICKEN or 1 EGG, which is what most of these numbnuts are probably thinking....... But I'd assume that 8 oz. of chicken has more protein than 8 oz of eggs because of the meat and muscle in chicken that eggs lack
The chicken 😂 An egg has about 6g protein, a whole chicken probably has about 80g
I think it depends more on how much you are eating of the eggs or chicken that matters. Chicken has more
Comparing 100g of each, raw, eggs have 13g of protein, chicken has 23g.
1 egg, 1 chicken...the chicken wins hands (hehe) down. Keep adding eggs, the egg will eventually win.
Chicken?
There are more than 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, at least 250 are known to be harmful. Among the 250 known harmful chemicals in this smoke, at least 69 can cause cancer. Two groups of cancer-causing chemicals found in tobacco smoke (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines (TSNA)) inside the bodies of smokers. Does it hurt your skin? Possibly from the inside out. Does it make you look old? Possibly from the inside out. Make no mistake, SMOKING WILL KILL YOU AND AGE YOU faster than a NON SMOKER.
Yes, second had smoke is also very dangerous to pets and children.
Me personally? Naaah
No, but it can effect you're lungs.
I have heard that it does .
no
Go see a skin doctor, might be an infection
see a doctor
A fùcking cat 🐱 bite retard.
A scar.
Yes, you can. The clitoris area is where thrush can often be at its worst, and it is totally safe to apply the cream there!
Yes. Of course apply as much as needed
Most yeast infection treatments come with a tube of topical anti itch cream. If not you can buy one and use it along with the one you're already using.
If you can apply it down there, yes.
Ya I guess
yes that is a good idea
of course
yes you can
call your doctor and ask him this hilarious question
Ora sex using hand? Um, can you demonstrate because I haven't got a clue what you mean.
Yes me diabetes I do it
It's not like the people are covered in sugar.
Just minimize the use of chocolate syrup.
Just do what you enjoy.
No worries...No problem.
mine is so tiny i can not say
Mine is 5 cm soft, 11 cm erect.
I bought this ProlargentSize first time and it gave me a longer penis, a stronger *****, longer time of erection and increased my blood flow. All these things resulted in me having sex again and again. Now after that, I have become a constant customer and I intend to buy it again as it has no harmful effects what so ever.
I'm 15 and penis is 8cm while soft, and 15cm while erect. No, it doesn't matter if your weiner is bigger than mine.
. I have good teeth. I take care of my teeth. I brush, them, floss them and use mouth wash as well. When I was younger, having crooked teeth didn't really bother me but now I'm 20 and it's really bothering me to the point I don't smile in my picture. People always telling me, I have a pretty smile but I don't see it because of my crooked teeth and I can't afford braces at all.
You should ask your family members and do whatever you can to save up money so you can pay for them yourself. You think its easy for anybody to pay for anything costing $4,000+? its not. I used to work almost 70 hour weeks for 2 weeks in a row every month so i could save some money to pay for my braces. But even if its just a few dollars, its a start
See area orthodontists about paying for what you need, on an installment plan. Things are more valuable when you work for them and reap the rewards.
Is there any reason why you cannot work as we all do and pay for them yourself? You want US to give our hard earned money to a complete stranger.
Go to work and get a job.
get a job and save up
There's a low risk, but yes, if there is an open sore or cut in and around your mouth
yes you can
Yes you can.
If you suck the dog off ..yes
Yes. Doctors are not required to give anyone medication..... How/why does he know you are looking for a new doctor? Some doctors have professional ethics and some are arrogant narcissists...
2
If he has any integrity he won't. And if he does, you should report his behavior to your state's medical board.
They will not do that. Their professional ethics would prohibit that.
Any doctor is intelligent, especially with the amount of schooling they receive.
Ive had a couple of doctors from India and they were the best doctors ive had the only thing that might be an issue is communication like for example if they had a strong accent that you couldnt understand. In my opinion some of the American doctors ive had would be stupid as hell and overlook things so It really just depends on the person I guess.
Judging by the ones ive seen on 'white castle' id say theyre very intelligentish.
above average.
superior
Dont cope with the stress just prepare for failure...or summer school
First of all, I do not wait this long to start that many projects. It is not stress that is your problem.
Learn how to budget your time better. 8 book reports? Is your teacher or slave-driver? Or have you just been slacking and procrastinating?
list the tasks. list the free hours. assign each task X hours. And until they are all done, quit coming here, to Facebook, and all other stupid internet. If that requires you ask your parents to hide your computer, then do that.
6 and 3/4 of what? Inches? Feet? Miles? It depends on what unit of measurement you're talking about
I think ur talking about inches (for down there). And yeah that's huge. I read somewhere the average in North America is something like 5 inches.
Averageish size
6ft 3/4in tall is a good normal height neither big nor small
Average... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
small for an afro american
No need to. I have a mighty bad taste in my mouth so my breaths gotta twang a bit...time for some mints I think.
lick the back of your hand and let it evaporate for a few seconds. You'll be left with the bacteria concentrated. Yum.
Yeah I just ate pizza. #noshame
you cant smell your own breath thats nearly impossible
what if your hand stinks?
If you feel like killing yourself, it's a cause for concern. I've been there done that with the teenage hormones, and what you are describing sounds really extreme - the hormone thing is attributed to up and down moodiness, and a general disagreement with parents/siblings...if you are feeling this negatively all the time with no real explanation, I would mention it to your doctor the next time you see them. It may be scary to admit but it is so much better to recover with the concern of others than to let it grow dangerously worse. Better safe than sorry. Remember that you are always loved, and good luck.
It's great that you are reaching out for help! We are so sorry to hear that you have been struggling. It really does sound like you have been through a lot. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent, aunt, uncle, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. Please consider getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
It does sound like depression. I have it and you need to be brave and tell your parents. They can take you to a doctor and they can give you medication. And I promise you the medication does work and will help you. I hope things get better for you <3
It's probably hormones. You need to find someone to talk to; maybe a friend you trust or your mother. You're beautiful and God loves you!
Start by talking to your school counselor or nurse. They may be able to tell you if this is something you need outside help with.
The important question here is not "How your vagina became loose", but what can you do about it once it becomes like a studio apartment. Really, it doesn't matter if it happen from passing some kids through it, or you were repeatedly hammered like a pornstar. The important thing to know is vaginal rejuvenation is not just for pornstars anymore. Kegel exercises do only so much, then you need expert help. Don't be embarrassed to talk to a doctor about this. Your enjoable sex life depends on it.
After it gets used a lot . Or "f***ed a lot" Example. Guy 1: Yo she looked super hot last night Guy 2. Yeah but she's slept around with like 15 guys. Guy 3: Ohhh she must be super loose. Thats what most people refer to when they say that. Another reason could be having a baby, lol. But either way I'm pretty positive thats just a rumor.
The only thing that can make a vagina become loose is child birth. Having sex with multiple partners is not going to do anything to it.
Jokes aside, it doesn't actually become loose from sex. It only becomes loose from childbirth. It is a pathway of muscles. It does not get "tight" or "loose." It gets stronger or weaker.
By giving birth to a baby. That's the only thing that's going to be large enough to stretch the vaginal wall. The vagina is designed and capable of expanding a large amount, so when people say that sex can cause it, it just isn't true, some women just have stronger vaginal walls than others, but the actual size is no different.
It doesn't. The vagina is a muscle, and a really powerful one at that. When a woman is aroused, or during birth, her vagina arches- or becomes wider. If you're turning a woman on, it should be somewhat 'loose', otherwise you suck at sex and you're probably tossing your cocktail weiner down a dry shaft anyways.
Not only does this taste great, but I did notice a decrease in my appetite. I love drinking coffee and tea anyways and this has helped me to keep on my weight loss routine. I would suggest Weight Loss Green Store Tea product to all tea drinkers or anyone trying to slow down their food intake .
childbirth , 3 children and loose doesn't even begin to describe it
pass a 10 cm head through it .
Ask your mom.
It depends on who exactly you're sleeping with. Will everyone know how to please you? No. Do you know how to please yourself? Yes. Does a warm hole feel better than your hand? In general yes but there are other considerations.
It depends on the individual. For most people sex with a partner is much more satisfying and intense. Solo sex, masturbation is fun... But when another person that you care deeply about is involved it's much more meaningful.
Your 15 you shouldn't be having sex , stick with self pleasure, imo
100 times better. It's like the difference between eating a veggie burger and a filet mignon.
What consequences- both are the same physiological act for a male, just one uses your hand the other a partner's vagina or mouth or other orifice.
It's normal. Sorry.
ALL boibs sag. They are made of FAT. There isn't anything to hold them up.
Liar.
not a lot you can do, thats just how your body is
Breast reduction.
if the retainer fit originally and after leaving it out for awhile it did not fit in correctly this is usually a sign of your teeth shifting. You need to wear the retainer as often as possible and take it out for only short periods of time. Hopefully wearing the retainer will solve this issue.
IF it does not fit properly then it is not doing the job your being charged for. Reconsider if you *need* it at all. Do you have a problem chewing, or is it just a cosmetic problem. Are you improving your health or making payments on your Dentists boat.
In my experience I would encourage you to wear it! The more you wear it the more comfortable it gets. If your teeth are shifting out of it so easily, they will just as easily shift back in.
Sure you will have a deeper voice, i was 16 when my voice started to change like uncontrolable voice pitch andd later subside, now im 18 and my voice deepens. It takes time.
No way to tell some guys don;'t get a deep voice.
Maybe, but you might also be a tenor (like me). If that's the case, c'est la vie. Not much you can do about it.
Then you're lucky. Maybe you can be the new Freddie Mercury. ;)
go see your doctor. ask your parents to make a physical. they can run some tests to make sure if you're at a healthy weight, and if not, what you should be at. they can run your cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other factors that maybe preventing it. your doctor can come up with a healthy diet and exercise plan that's realistic. everybody is different in weight, and only time will tell when you gain or lose, and your genetics play a part as well.
At 13 its usually very hard to gain weight due to fast metabolism. I would recommended either waiting until your body naturally thinkens out as you get older or try gaining some muscle mass.
drink 3 large chocolate shakes a day - 7 days a week and you will gain weight. I guarantee it
You're only 13, you will gain weight as you age, don't force it or you will regret it.
carbs
No, I have been driving my car when a person was sitting beside me smoking weed and I had the wondows open and i didnt get high.
Do you feel high?
no you didn't
No.
Squats are the best I've tried everything! And sometimes those can be tough a good way starting out would be if you watch alot of TV every commercial stand up and sit back down repeat every commercial. And sit ups there's multiple different ways to sit ups but there all work different areas
Equestrian is great for working the legs. Abs: Anything that works the core, really. Standing, walking, lifting things, good posture (that's a good one), squats (even without weight - or put a saddle on your back for some weight).
Running on stairs

You aren't working for free.... you are getting paid less because you are working less. You have an hourly wage... of course it's going to be less money for less hours. Sucks but they can do it. Find a different job.
First actually figure out if this happening. Do they know you are anonymously contributing hours? Is there a way they measure the amount of time you are there that you could completely accurately state your actual hours? At the USA I read that it is a nifty time to find a new job, a less nifty moment for them to find new workers.
No one here can possibly know how tall you will be. Most boys have their growth spurts by the time they are about 16, while some boys continue to grow until they are about 18. Look at the male relatives on both sides of your family and that will give you an idea of how tall you will be. Your height is controlled by your genetics.
If you're 16 or more you'll have stopped.
my mom is 177 and dad 184
You could apply for Corrazieri (Italy)
No way to predict how tall you would be.
stretching
Here's a few things A small snack with carbs like pretzels, cereal or crackers Chamomile tea, lemon balm tea, passion flower tea Aromatherapy like lavender, sweet orange, etc. You can buy mixes for relaxation. Magnesium supplements work great! There's one called Neuro Sleep you can get at the grocery store. Thetes one called Calm or Mama Calm from health stores thats a powder.Soaking in s bath of Epsom salts will make you tired. Melatonin in capsule form
It's the calcium that helps you sleep. Calcium pills and a small dose of vitamin D give the same effect. Vitamin D is toxic in large doses, but if you only take one pill a day the risk is small. If you are intolerant to any food you should study some books about nutrition so you know a few things. For instance if you take calcium every day, you also need to take magnesium.
Does milk physically actually help wit that??? I thought it was a myth
A glass of red wine.
Whiskey.
Yes. I am surprised you didn't have a wet dream.
Quite normal, you are sexually functional now and your body is beginning to crave sex. So erotic dreams are normal.
yes it's normal
At 13 = yes. < M
yes, but am let down to see my tiny weiner when i awaken
yup
yeah. healthy-relationship-dating.com/masturb...
Yeah dude, I know you might have told a HUGE lie involving a broken ankle and it appears right now that the thought of getting caught out is the worst thing in the world but trust me, if you go through with this you will regret it later in life when this injury prevents you from doing something you want to. You'll be fine, man up and face your demons. At some point you will look back on this and it will seem insignificant, we all make mistakes. Just don't make any mistakes that's going to screw you over in the future. Take care and good luck.
I think it's impossible to break your ankle without it hurting. It can be relatively painless if you don't move the injured foot after breaking it, but it still depends on your pain tolerance.
I'm gonna ask a question myself, why the hell are you trying to break your ankle?
You can't and you don't want to do this. Breaking bones causes problems later in your life and can cause permanent issues.
Surgery.
You can't.
You need therapy
Numb your foot. A lot.
are you trying to break your ankle?
Why would you want that? I think the only way is to fake it :P
Well - you can't get the sleeping pills. They'd be prescription - and even if you can get those, they now add stuff to the to make you throw them all up when you overdose. So sadly that avenue to suicide isn't open anymore. So just be real careful. And don't to the really stupid thing and take a bottle of Tylenol..... so many kids do that and it just tears the crap out of your liver. But I do agree - "There is literally no reason for it"........... except life is it's own answer if you can find it.
Whoever said you needed a reason to be suicidal, in fact it is widely accepted by professionals that depression (I know this isn't the same as suicide) doesn't always have a 'reason'. Go to the doctors, they are inclined to ask why you feel this way, but if you can't answer, they should have ways to help you because this isn't as rare as you might think. There is still hope!
it is a illusion. ur right u shouldnt do it. exspecuiall yu the gas thing as u could kill pp. and ppla re very precious. .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
its not the destination its the journey. you got to value time/experiences. not that everything is infinite or not. the universe doesn't really have a meaning to it (that we know) you got to give it meaning.
find something you love to do, find a hobby, go to the gym, keep yourself busy! find a reason that makes you wanna move forward
Don't tell me to phone a help line or anything because it doesn't help. Right now there is only one person that will want to help me and is really good at helping me. I'm not that close to her so i don't know how to ask her for help. I've talked to a few times before due to a mutual friend who asked her to speak to me about suicide and self harm but I haven't spoken to her in a while so I don't know what to say in a message to her
I been there done that. Look, sometimes life sucks and this sounds good, but its selfish and only losers do that. You will hurt people close to you (they dont deserve the s*it), so you are kind of a dou*hebag than. Also nobody will respect you, they will say" oh what a quiter, what a loser and they slowly forget.......
honestly, just go to twitch.tv and watch some people play games, find the low viewer rooms and chat with the streamer, it'll take your mind off things
If you're a female do it.
How long did they say it would take? If you didn't ask, give them a call. Smaller opticians won't be making the lenses on the premises, they'll be cut and ground elsewhere; then sent to the opticians for framing and; once they're ready you'll be contacted to make a collection and fitting appointment. It isn't unusual to wait for a week or two - especially if its your first prescription or at busy times (such as in the run up to the summer holidays).
They tell you when you order the glasses, normally. Usually it's about a week.
Soon enough
you should of got them by now
Do you know how easily that could lead to an infecion?? Why do you feel the need to put things in your vagina?? I think you should maybe talk to someone about this before you hurt yourself or get and infection that could lead to and illness! P.s I hope you got tested after putting that used condom up there!
have you tried having a guy stick his penis inside there
Your mum?
how about a black mambo monster dildo
How about a penis?
Life is a one way round. There's no going back after you commit suicide. Your life could be worse, theres people who dont have body parts, dont have parents, dont have a shelter, dont have an education. I say cherish what you have and what you would leave behind after you do that. Theres a way out of this deep hole. Its just in the back of your head waiting to burst and put you back into place. Dont waste your only life, use it wisely. I hope the best for you. Best wishes, Dan.
Well I have clinical bipolar depression, anxiety has well and OCD, I just recently beat HOCD and it was a nightmare 24/7. I'm pretty sure if I have made it to where I am in life you can beat this and get through it. It suck *** but in the long run you don't want to kill yourself. Iv contemplated suicide last year and it really is hard to fight but don't do it. Stay strong! Working out helps me so give that a try.
Please do NOT commit suicide. You was put on this earth for a reason. Remember that you are not the only one going through problems. You are not in this alone. You just need to find a way to get through it. Talk to some friends or a family member about your problem so you can get help. Please take it easy & try to relax. I wish you the best of luck.
No! Suicide is NEVER the answer! It's also a selfish act. Life is like a roller coaster. The speed is time. The scary parts are the downhills of life. And the thrill is the best thing of life! Don't do it!
Be confident. Parents should be teaching their own children. Paying for education is not worth it. Try to do what makes you happy. School is only a preparation for jobs and debt. Teach others about happiness. Food water and home. What else could any of us need other than peace and happiness
Don't do it! You have really shitty, toxic parents. This has nothing at all to do with you, even though it does affect you. You have done nothing wrong. They have, by treating you so poorly. Normal parents treasure and love their children, and do not blame them for their own problems, ever! Please seek counseling. That can help you realize how messed up they are. So sorry that they are messing with your head like that, but you have to do you now, to be in a healthy, productive state of mind.
You might be able to drop 3 - 5 lbs of water weight and maybe another 1 or so of fat, in that amount of time, if you eat super clean, really low cal, exercise a lot, and drink LOTS of water to flush out any excess. Beyond that, it's not going to happen, and the water weight loss won't stay off long. What's best is planning ahead. A 10 lb fat loss can happen in 1 month, but giving yourself 2 - 3 months is better and more realistic. The slower you lose, the better chance of keeping it off long term.
You could look into juice fasting and of course exercise always works if you do not put in the effort how to you expect to see results. However trying to shed off 10lbs in 5 days is kind of impossible to some degree and also very unhealthy. Extreme dieting usually results in rebounding and packing on more weight.
Eat very little and do a ton of cardio. You still wn't lose 10 lbs.
sorry but that's physically impossible

People do that ?
Most people who pay for it want it to land on them.
I would think that those that have that particular fetish would prefer it to be hot and fresh from the source

Not me.
Yes the testes are the male version of ovaries. Basically males - nuts drop/ females - nuts inside
the testes are ovaries. the scrotum is the labia. the penis head is the clitoris. the penis shaft develops after in a female it never develops. every person starts as female in the womb. we only become male later. almost every male part started off differently as female.
In layman's terms, yes. The testicles produce sperm cells, which carries the male's genetic information. The ovaries produce ovum (eggs), which carries the females genetic information.
Because not all of them have a mental illness. I know they have mental illness at a higher rate than the general population but discriminating against them is not to be excused due to that.
Whatever it is or isn't there's no reason to go screaming into the rest room about it. Their problem isn't one of violence, they just, for whatever reason, want to be treated as if they were the opposite sex. That in no way affects me. I can call someone Bruce or Caitlyn without it meaning anything to me. We deal with people with mental problems everyday, egotists, paranoids, depressives and we go on about our business.
I'm with conservatives on this one. I can't see that this bathroom bill is some broad attack on gays. Guys like Jenner liking to wear dresses should not be a reason we have to call them "her" or use women's bathrooms.
Is it a mental illness? Do you have clinical proof of that?
Are you kidding, that would be admitting that they have the same sickness
Please don't make assumptions aboit what liberals insist you act.....it's not all so clear cut as that.
Bipolar depression is not a disorder. Bipolar Disorder is a mental illness that is composed of periods of depression and periods of mania. You do not describe anything that resembles mania. You can not diagnose her nor can she diagnose herself. IF she has either Bipolar or depression then she needs to be under the care of a doctor.
Yes, overeating and listening to angry/sad music are ways of coping with depression. I am not sure about the scalding baths, but the other two activities are common coping mechanisms. And yes, it is typical for people to be angry and aggressive. I hope all goes okay. Wishing you the best :)
No, I'm sorry. I'm 15 and I have some teenage angst and mood swings but nothing that severe. I think she needs therapy or something
Update ! I do not watch her bathe but I see her come from the shower with Red skin
"Where do i get the best strawberries?" Where you will get the best strawberries is from a farm where you can go pick them yourself. By picking you going directly to a farm where you can pick the strawberries yourself you will know that they're fully ripe, versus what you will find in any store, or even possibly at a local farmers market, which may have been shipped in from somewhere else, and actually aren't grown locally. It also means that by picking you own strawberries, you will know that they are fully ripe, and not partially green yet. You will also notice the difference in the taste.
The sources vary wildly.
You can get them from a market. They usually sale fresh items.
Grow them yourself.
I've been on a very strict diet, and i mean strict (egg whites in the morning, salad and tuna for lunch, vegetables for snacks, dinner is either fish or chicken with more salad, and no eating after 6pm) and I'm dying for normal food. I don't want to ruin my diet, because weight loss is my goal right now, so just wondering if once a week cheating would be okay? Please help.
Stop being a moron. Eat more. Half of what you eat should be fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, the other half split between proteins and complex carbohydrates. Eat only small amounts of fatty, sugary, salty, and highly processed foods. You should have a small cheat every day. What your doing is ruining your health, and building up cravings, so you will binge, and not be able to maintain a healthy diet. Stop what you're doing. If you mostly eat nourishment, yes, some nummy stuff is fine.
I'm sorry but you don't need to do a "cheat day." Just eat well 90% of the time. The other 10% of the time will be that pizza party at work, someone's birthday or Thanksgiving or Christmas or your vacation. The less "cheating" you do, the more you enjoy those other things 10% of the time.
It doesn't work for me. I'll go all in. Many people feel it's fine, that it doesn't waste a week of hard work, that it doesn't sabotage efforts. Might these be the same group who complain that diets don't work? Use your best judgment as you know if you can restrain yourself once temptation without hindrance sets in.
The problem with cheat days is you can completely wipe out any deficit you created during the week. I personally eat the same foods I always have just less of them and try to stay active as much as possible. 11 pounds down.
Most girls will run screaming when they see 10 inches aimed at them.
No actually it probably wouldn't. That's a chode. Btw I laughed for 10 minutes at this question
So it's basically the same size as your brain. Fabulous.

Did you just measure a ruler with another ruler???
Yes
No. My Dad lived until 100 years and seven months.
I like to think I'm still young.
Only if you're a donkey.
I wonder they same thing because I edge all the time but don't bust my nut that often
Yes.
Yes , but it can make a person painful in testicles

Stage 2a WHAT?? Cancer? COPD? COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is an illness of the lungs which inhibits breathing. It cannot be cured, but it can be treated in order to prevent it from getting worse. I have moderate COPD. For some reason, it gives me the most trouble when the weather is hot and humid outside. When it does, I use a Spiriva inhaler.
COPD is an incurable lung disease. 2a shouldn't be that serious but sounds like she's got a lot of health issues.
Stage 2a what?? No dr told her copd can't be treated; it can't be cured..

she is in a lot of pain very weak and only 95 lbs. what is her prognosis?
I had acute bronchitis and I think I'm over it cause I'm not coughing and there's no sinus pressure and I feel I top of the world. But when I take the medicine, I get filled with anxiety so where I can't sit still, and feel extremely nauseous. Like today I've felt great until I took the pill, and now I'm filled with anxiety. Tomorrow would be my last pill out of the bunch. Can I just not take it?
Go ahead and finish your medication. You need to let your Dr. know about the concerns you're having about your reactions to this medication.
Finish your medicine. It's important.
If you do not take the entire prescription, your infection can return, only this time it might not be as treatable. Misuse of antibiotics as you describe contributes to the increase of drug-resistant strains of bacteria.
BMI is a poor tool for predicting obesity. It was never designed for this purpose, but has gained popularity because of the correlation between those who are obese and those who have a "high' BMI. Every obese person will have a high BMI, while not all who have a high BMI will be obese.
BMI's are incorrect for most people because it doesn't take muscle into consideration and we are all made up of muscle
BMI doesn't take muscles, and body structure into consideration.
the aggressive in your face campaign about the restroom issues IS and issue, Forcing something utterly unpopular upon the vast majority of the public, More as a show of power than assisting gender confused people.
They love to whine about non-issues and interfere with the personal lives of woman, the voting rights of people, restrict the rights of gay people, demonize the transgender, and incarcerate people for smoking weed.
Move on to real problems? Is it that you're too fcking stupid to recognize the hypocrisy in your post?
Well the GOP is in the toilet, so it makes sense.
No. But then it's true that if you identify as an idiot you keep asking stupid questions on Yahoo Answers
No you are not, and the "girl trapped in a man's body" is a bullsh!t misconception. If you were truly trans, then yes you could.
Go ahead But understand that if I'm waiting for my Mom and she complains about you then you will have a very large problem standing in front of you
She uses a stall, I don't agree with urinals in the ladies room nor are they planning to do so
I'm an old man trapped in a young man's body. I want p*ssy now!
They use stalls. But What you are saying in this comment is the only reason you have not engaged in pedophilic activities it's because of bathroom regulations, but the moment they change you will engage in pedophlic activities? Thanks, for confirming that Republicans are pedophiles and irresponsible thus making them unfit to steer the U.S to positivity
Well you have been peeing on your mom for years as she changed your diaper, so what would the difference be now. Most adult females are willing to help juveniles with a poopy or pis*sy diaper get changed into a dry one. If you are lucky, maybe they will powder your diaper rash as*s too
Women with no military experience that identify as women that have been in combat are now allowed to lead special forces units.
I don't understand why so many folks love to flaunt their ignorance by posting questions like this.
If you try you may meet a mean old lady with a cane who just happens to trip
You are a tiny bit away from being clinically obese - you are certainly overweight. 6,000 calories a day is obscene, especially if half are from sugar-rich foods. Read about Type 2 diabetes. If you carry on the way you are going you will have Type 2 diabetes within a decade or two. Then you'll be having your feet checked regularly for ulcers and loss of sensation, and eventually you might be facing having your feet or lower legs amputated. That's the reality.
You are overweight. Good thing is you're young and can turn it around quickly. Since you're already tracking your intake, start there. 6000 calories is at least 3 times what your daily consumption should be. Getting rid of most of the junk food and Coke will bring that number way down. Up your exercise to at least 1/2 hour a day. Good Luck!
Yes, you are overweight, but don't feel bad. Just try to eat less and be active, and you'll lose pounds. Also, junk food tastes a lot better when you don't have it all the time. Good luck:)
yes and self harm is a symptom of depression. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it but, after that, you will be a whole, new, calm, happy person.
Yes... lol. You are harming yourself therefore it's self harm.
If you did it with the intent to harm yourself, then yes. If it was just an outlet, then maybe not.
No, it's more uncontrolled anger issues.
yes it is
This probably sounds insane and panicky, but I'm so scared. What are the signs when a tooth infection gets serious? I have a tooth infection and in 5 days my tooth is getting pulled. I've had the infection for a few years now. Lately, I've had horrible headaches, a weird odor in urine, and the edges of one of my nails turned green. The green is gone now, and I bite my nails, if that had anything to do with it. What should I do? And am I going to be okay?
A homeless guy I help had a infected tooth and I took him to a free dental clinic. His face (jaw) was very swollen. The dentist told him that if he had waited 24 more hours he would be in the hospital with blood poisoning and possibly dead. GO TO A DENTIST if you value your life.
If the dentist already looked at it then you should be okay. They would've told you if there was anything else wrong. Once you get the tooth extracted the side effects of the infection will go away.
it can spread to other teeth, your jaw if not treated - id your green nails are caused by a tooth infection, you need to get medical help asap - your whole body could be seriously messed up
If you had a tooth infection for "a few years" you'd be dead.

That's about average size for age 16 and over
Big is a bit generous... How 'bout above average?
Yes, average adult size is 5.16 inches.
every woman's vagina is different. Some like it big others like it small.
Unlikely I would think. I can only see you getting sick if this person had say sneezed on their hand and then touched your hair. You then touched our hair with your hands and then rubbed your eyes with same hand, put in nose or mouth, etc.. where germs could get into your system. and it would have to be a fairly quick set of actions. If you are not touching your face much and wash your hands regularly, you should be fine. But technically, I'd say the possibility exists.
No not possibly. In order to get sick from someone else, you must get into physical contact with them. Ex: If that person coughed or sneezed in their hand you touch it and then you don't wash your hands and eat, you'll get sick. But if someone touches your hair, it is very unlikely to cause you to get sick.
No, you can't get infections from hair contact. Now if the kid breathed on you you could get a virus if he was contagious.
no you can't
No you Can Not.
After a few weeks you will realize that all this worrying was for nothing. What you are describing doesn't hurt much at all, as long as you don't move it or try to put weight on it. Ask your Doctor how long it will take for a full recovery.
Obviously it's going to hurt a little because it's an operation but you'll have painkillers and you'll be fine soon enough, it won't be unbearable pain! And the nurses will always be there if you have any problems! Hope op goes well :-)
don't worry I did an operation adenoid operation and when I woke up there was a weird things in my nose I wanted to remove them but they told me no don't remove it but it doesn't really hurt you just feel dizzy for the first few hours because of the anesthetic simple as that
You'll be fine, maybe a bit sore and loopy-feeling for a few hours after but still fine.
Nope. Not really. They will also give you pain meds to take home with you when released. You will be fine. I had 38 stitches on my A** and I was in less pain than when I went in.
you'll be full of painkillers
Not really...after all the painkillers
After the anesthesia and or nerve block wears off yes, tremendous pain.

Since masturbation is a private matter, it is unlikely that anybody knew for certain whether or not anyone else masturbated. However, since masturbation is something that every boy discovers and enjoys, one can be reasonably certain that the great masters also did it.
No, it's safe to say that pretty much everybody has masturbated, interestingly enough though, masturbation wasn't even considered, historically speaking, it wasn't until the Puritan Revolution in the 17th Century that masturbation started to be considered as sinful.
Me thinks that the greatest masters tell fibs
NO they are liars. You cannot find any male who has never masturbated, Regards
Nobody knows
no
No...
It's fine, but the bra may be uncomfortable if it an underwire, so wear a sports bra to bed. It's actually good to wear a supportive garment or bra at night if your breasts are growing large, it helps them stay perky and not sag as much from gravity.
Sure, it's fine.
Hun, you can sleep naked if you want. Sleep however is comfy for you.
you should be sleeping naked. its healthy. it helps your vagina breathe.SLEEP NAKED
Why? You'll be really sore if having sex with a girl- or guy for that matter. Solo, an hour is fine usually. But no girl can stand being penetrated for an hour she'd be so sore she'd have trouble walking. Think of your partner when having sex.

So I've been reading and researching a lot about mental health and mental illness lately, and I read that there actually is no such thing as a chemical imbalance in the brain. That kind of surprised me, because like a lot of people, at first I believed in the chemical imbalance myth. Up until now I thought that mental illnesses such as depression and schizophrenia are due to abnormalities in the brain, but after what I recently read, I guess that's not the case. So then what's the REAL reason behind mental illness? Do the different mental illnesses have different causes? Does the cause vary from person to person? Does biology play ANY role? Thanks a lot in advance!
Could you list some sources of these articles claiming there is no such thing as chemical imbalance? Schizophrenia and Parkinson's are both caused by an imbalance of dopamine, either too much or not enough. So to say that there isn't a such thing as this is to say that all of the mental illnesses linked to chemical imbalances need to be reassessed and back to the drawing board. So I'm curious to learn where you heard these bold claims. Thanks:)
Your confused. The phrase "chemical imbalance " isn't the only possible way a brain could have an abnormality. Of course different disorders have different causes. If you have been reading a lot, why haven't you learned anything? Or can't you find anything on studies of causes of brain based mental illness? Of course the biology and bio chemistry of the brain have a role. If you learned that people can't fly on broomsticks, would you conclude that air travel doesn't exist?
Where exactly did you read that misinformation? I can tell you for a fact that medications that change my brain chemistry lessen my mental illness symptoms.
If you unsettle the mind frequently for no reason, it may get confused. In your own interests, please don't do such misadventures.
Depends. Do you want to? I mean I'm a guy and I don't mind body hair. It's natural. Although I don't think many guys my age think like this.
I think it's natural that hair grows there at all. However, I think it must be well kempt like every other part of our bodies (other pubic hairs inclusive). If you don't have the time for that you may simply clean regularly. Where I come from, it is expected that one is clean shaven in the armpit and in the nether regions because it is believed too much old pubic hair gives one bad odor. Personally, I leave a little on so that I don't itch when it's growing back. However, is up to you. You own your body. You decide.
No. Everyone has hair around the anus. It's natural. There is no reason to remove the hair there. It's there for a reason. Men don't care and don't notice if there's hair there.
I definitely wouldn't do it with a razor (OMG can you imagine if you cut your ANUS??? OUCH!) but if you have more than just a small amount of peach fuzz, then yeah, wax it, girl! Everyone on here is saying stuff about anal sex, but even if you are not doing anal sex (which you shouldn't by the way...it can cause serious long term damage, and horrible hemorrhoids, and it's not sanitary at all) he will probably still be seeing "THAT REGION" even if you're just having regular intercourse.
I don't see the point really and hopefully you don't have any cuts there when you do shave you could get an infection of the anus. I shave around it though
yes a girl Should remove the hair from her anus
Do not use a razor. Take a pic of your anus. It is not smooth. The razor will tear it to bits. It is worse than a boy shaving when he has acne. Don't do it
Yess Womesn should clean hairs from her anus.. because big hairs are cause of bad smell
It's depends. Does it bother you? Does it stick out of your underwear or go through it? If it really annoys you remove it. It can also cause a yeast infection. (Not always) It might be a good idea to remove it but if it really doesn't bother you then you don't have to go through the hassle of shaving or waxing.
Imbalanced hormones. Try to take birth control even if you're not sexually active, it regulates your hormones and clears your skin. Testosterone is responsible for acne specially body, and as a teenager even as a girl, it's not uncommon. Everyone has estrogen and testosterone in them. I had the same issue and it cleared everything for me. Even my dandruff and scalp problems. I also don't get hot flashes etc that came with puberty.
Most people get acne during puberty.
Don't worry dear you can treat yourself just only you need to take regular Accutane 10mg tablet. You can buy it from online portal bestbuymedsonline.
There ISN'T a flesh-eating bacteria caused by diabetes, sir.

Hi guys I am a 13 year old female love in Ireland and today I went to the doctors about hayfever and i was sure she would ask me aboit a physics exam because I didn t have one since I was 5yrs do u think this is normal will I ever have one I got no shots I don t want to ask for one I just want to know that I am healthy on the inside please please help
Hay fever doesn't require a physical. Doctors are always running short on time because they have to see so many people in a certain day that they will only do what you ask them to do. If you asked for a physical you would of needed to tell the receptionist that you wanted a physical exam as well
Irish doctors have a different approach and it is not always the best. Most of my relatives in Ireland don't know what their diagnosis is. When I ask what the doctor did they say the doctor gave them some tablets. They don't know what kind or what they are for. I usually ask them what the bottle says and the spell the drug for me. My s-I-l calls the doctor and asked for blood work and a physical when she thinks its time for one or is worried about something and this works. You will have to do the same thing.
You need to make an appointment for a PHYSICAL. They will then schedule extra time to check over all of you. Then be sure the doctor knows you have had no medical care (shots, etc) since you were 5.
Trust me, they won't ask for a physics exam.
We don't do them in the UK. You would have had your shots when you were younger. hayfever does not require a full physical in the UK.
Call me when you are 21.
Stop Bleeding. Apply direct pressure on the cut or wound with a clean cloth, tissue, or piece of gauze until bleeding stops. If blood soaks through the material, don't remove it. Put more cloth or gauze on top of it and continue to apply pressure.
Sprinkle black pepper on it. Doesn't sting and stops the bleeding.
Use alcohol wipes on it to sanitize the cut, and use gauze and a bandaid.
Please go to the doctor. If you leave it keep bleeding, you maybe ran out of blood. Best wishes!
Hi I am 13 (14 in 1 and a half weeks) I have illness. Anxiety. I have a worry that I don't like to talk about which is me thinking I have a brain tumour. I've had a light headache on and off daily for the past 9 months. It's at the back-top to the left. It's rather light but the thought just kills me. I did have a pen thrown to may head in a similar area a while ago. I'm just really worried about a light on off headache that I've had for 9 months. Please help, thanks.
Tell your parents or guardian. At your age they are the 9nly ones who can do anything about it. Anxiety can cause headaches. Dehydration is a big cause. Needing glasses could also be the answer. Brain tumour is not at all likely.
Don't be so silly!! A pen thrown at your head doesn't cause a tumour. If you have had a headache for 9 months I would see you doctor. You need too chill out. good luck.
The only way to diagnose a tumor would be to have an MRI done on your brain, but it's unlikely you have a tumor.
This is all your imagination. Cancer or tumors would give you other symptoms, vision problems, balance, etc,, not just a headache.
Is your headache 24/7? If so you should tell your mother.
life is so boring like i already see myself dead i know that i dont really exist anymore so it wouldnt really matter if i killed myself or not because no matter what ill die lol im so bored i hate myself i cant sleep anymore or do anything i dropped out of school when i was 11 (mostly my dads fault) i remember hating myself ever since i was in 4th grade i would constantly compare myself to other people and i genuinely know that life isnt for me lol theres no way i was made for this world
Everyone is put in this world for a reason, you just have to find that reason. If you like sports maybe you should try being social by going to the gym get a basketball game going. You need to seek out the good in yourself and in the world. There's something good in everyone.
If you'd like to try finding something you like to do, you should try different things without giving up on them. For instance, you could always join a club and become a lackey of Haruhi Suzumiya.Or you could get a lame job and bum around until you meet the amazing love of your life, or something.
You can be helped if you can just find the right avenue. If you have money, no problem. Since you probably don't, try your city, county or state mental health agencies.
How about not trolling? You can't drop out when you're 11. You said you're 42 in your last question. You really don't have anything else to do?
If you kill yourself think of all the amazing things you could be cancelling, everybody is made for this world. The world is many things you just have to find out for yourself and live your life.

what is the average size foot for a 6'6 male ? I wear a size 16 and I hate shoe shopping my girlfriend if 5'4 and a size 10 (im on her account) she complains about it all the time she says there soooo huge and I think they are so cute and tiny and she said im normal for my height and its okay for guys to have big feet but I think there huge what do you think is the average shoe size for a guy my size? My girlfriend always makes me feel better about it but im just curious about what the average size is. Thanks in advance
Your shoe size sounds about right for you size, your girlfriend's shoe size at 10 though is huge for her size.
I am 6'5 and wear a size 13. But I do think she does has big feet but hey, I wouldn't have any problem with hers so if she wants the truth, both of you have big feet and you all are perfect for each other. Plus I think your kids will be great swimmers.
Size 16 is exceptionally large for any man of any height. Height has nothing to do with shoe size smart one.
It's much easier to have acute poisoning with tylenol. In other words, if you take a lot of tylenol, that will destroy your liver than taking a bunch of alcohol. However, with chronic use, alcohol would be worse. If you're trying to rationalize your alcohol consumption, see your doctor.
Both are pretty bad, but it depends largely on amount. Some alcohol once in a while is no big deal. Same with lower doses of Tylenol. You definitely don't want to consume them together. For me, I simply decided to make sure I never take Tylenol or products with acetaminophen in them, and use Advil for headaches and such instead.
Alcohol
Omg!!!!! I feel so sorry for you!!!! Only a week? Well, if I were you, I'd just straight up tell your family how long you have left to live and then hopefully they'll understand. Make the most of it by going somewhere like the beach or somewhere you've always wanted to go to. You could even go somewhere that brings back memories. I don't think I was much help but I just wanted to say something about this <3
If you genuinely had a week to live because you were terminally ill it would be very obvious to everyone around you that something was wrong. Unless your doc is some sort of psychic and knows you're going to fall under a bus in a week's time, then you'll have to try harder than this to sound convincing.
That's not funny. Go troll somewhere else. If you did only have a week then it would mean that you are terminally ill and that would be very obvious to your wife and children. Also. You wouldn't even be out of the hospital if you are terminally ill
If I were your kids or your wife, I would want to know. Because you don't want them to hold a grudge after the matter. Tell them you love them and then do something special with them. You may feel hesitant because you don't want them to be sad but they would probably want to know so they can make the best out of the last few days they have with their dad/husband. Just make the best out of it and maybe take a family trip for a few days. All prays go out to you my friend
If you only had a week to live you'd be in Hospice right now, not running around looking healthy.
Wow. People r rude. No one knows if this person is telling the truth and if he is, you ppl really kno how to make sumone feel like ****. Just because your dying doesnt mean youd be in a hospital or be online and im sure his family knows hes sick..but how come they have to kno he has a week to live?!? My mother in law has cancer and has a month to live and shes known for a week and her family just found out because it was hard to her to tell them! You dont always kno if ppl r lying !!!
If you truly only have a week its best to do something special with them...... keep the info to yourself since it will create worry and rob them of enjoying the few moments you have left to share with them.
A week to live and you waste time here? Right. Your life is already over. So sad. And you tell us before you tell them.
That's pretty pathetic trollling.
Write them a letter and head for the hills.
Been there done that with an older femail g/f when I was 23, she used her 10 inch vibrator on me anally which I loved as a starter to full on sex. Yeh it can hurt a lot if you don't use lube and know a few tricks to prevent the pain, such as bear down on the strap on like when doing a poo this relaxes the anal spinchtor muscles and up it goes, your prostate will get massaged which is an incredible feeling. Enjoy !!
What the hell? Why is all these guys commenting on this in a positive way? Look if you like to be penetrated then you're gay. Nothing wrong with being gay. Just don't stick things up your @$$ and call yourself heterosexual. Also there is something really wrong with a woman that want to do that to you. My wife ever wanted to do something like that to me I'd divorce her. If I asked her to do that to me she'd divorce me. Really, what is up with all the unnatural sexuality going on today? I'm starting to believe in the feminization through plastic theory of American men.
Good for you, yes it WILL hurt a lot! 1. Relax that's the only way you will be abel to enjoy it. 2. Losses your hole well before you shove 7" down there (Start with one finger movie up to two SLOWLY) 3. Use lots of lube Let use know how it goes, I'm interested!
It''s gonna hurt.
Could be painful if you haven't had anal penetration before. But can be fun.
I mean if your not afraid. I'd go smaller like 4in to begin with and then move to 7
That's a big dild@, try using a smaller one, cuz that is gonna hurt ALOT! It might even bleed!
Buy anal eze or anal blu, it will numb your asshole for the most part. Then also get ANAL lube.
I also want this to be done with me by my wife
Contact school authorities ahead of time. You will probably have to show documentation that your doc says you need her. If she calms you, then I would imagine she'll calm you. You will probably be known as the kid with the cat. Whether students will understand or accept you depends on the school culture. But don't just show up with a cat. Find out from the people who would know. The sooner the better, both so they can address policy, and so you can mentally prepare.
No you can't. The only special treatment you get for an emotional support animal is that you can't be turned away from housing that normally doesn't allow them. You can not take them to school, restaurants, hospitals, or anywhere.... You might be able to get the principal to allow it but I seriously doubt it.... if he allows your's then he will have to allow everyone's.... so basically.... No, you can't.
Unless you have a doctor's order saying you need to have your cat with you, there's no chance you can bring your cat with you to school.
No. Instead take a picture of it or even a video to look at when you feel anxious.
You need to get it registered as a guide dog.
Maybe in a special school, but normally, no.
I'd be a little concerned about what you're eating, but given the demographics of this cite, I'm going to make the clear decision to say that it's because you're in puberty. You are trying to grow 45 pounds and 7 inches. That doesn't come from farts in the wind, it comes from food. Every parent complains that their pubescent kid eats everything.
The pad will fall apart and blood in a pool is an open invite to make others sick of you get something. Tampon is the only way or refrain from the pool for the week.
Yes but use a tampon or a menstrual cup. I remember a couple of years ago me and my best friend went swimming and she leaked through. We both laugh about it now, but it didn't matter so much as it was her private pool. but at a public swimming pool and as most people are freaked out my any sight of blood. It would not be good for it to leak due to social that we live in. Pads will leak as my best friend found out.
Being in a swimming pool will not impede your period in the least. Your body and your hormone level do not know that you are in a swimming pool while you are menstruating. But if you DON'T wear a tampon in the water, the pad is just going to get water-logged and heavy, and its outline will be visible under your wet bathing suit. If you insist on wearing a pad, do NOT go in the water. Just lie beside the pool and sun bathe.
I wear pads and live on the coast so I swim alot. During my period, it's true. I don't bleed. Nor do I bleed when I'm in the shower. Apparently, getting in the water at all stop the blood flow for a while. I hate swimming but I hate bleeding more so I swim a lot more on my period.
I've heard that being in water will stop a light flow for up to an hour, but I've never tried it myself. If you wear a pad in the pool, the blood will go right through it. It won't do you any harm to get in the pool while on your period, but you will still be bleeding for at least the first few minutes.
if your wearing a tampon you should be fine. As long as you are wearing a fresh one that may not cause it to bleed a little in the pool,depending on the tampons absorbency. I wear regular absorbent tampons and they work for me because i dont bleed that heavy if you are wearing a pad,sit alongside the pool,dip your feet in and sun bathe. Like what Edna said.
The water pressure will not keep the blood from leaking. There are many alternatives that you can use, but they all involve using some sort of device to catch the blood or using waterproof underwear (only work for a light flow).
If the tampon is positioned properly, you can't even tell that it's in there. There's no particular sensation when putting it in (unless you're doing it wrong -- then it can hurt or feel awkward) or taking it out. It's not sexually stimulating, if that's what you're asking; it's just a tampon.
It doesnt hurt at all to use tampons. You forget you are even wearing one. And they keep things cleaner down there because it soaks up the blood on the inside. I find for me when i take one out i can go a couple hours after with just a panty liner.
Women feel very little, if anything, in their "areas". A tampon is inserted into the vagina, and the vagina has very few nerve endings in it. There would be no reason for a woman to feel ANYTHING after changing a tampon.
Normal
I don't use tampons, but after changing pads I feel totally normal. Not counting period pain, of course.
That is something I want to know too. I'm curious. I am woman and never been using a tampon ever.
Yes
I feel a tingling sensation in my toes. Also, my fingers usually go a slight purpley blue colour. Sometimes I pass out as this all happens, but its totally normal girls.
Normal, but sometimes it get itchy down there putting in a new one if it's all dry down there and stuff.
I'm not sure about other girls but I use my hand or any epidermal area which reaches & has sensation
You should go to a doctor. Something may be wrong.
Pox or crabx
A possible STD? :(
no way:D
I've found that I've been hearing things clearly not playing, and catching things out of the corner of my eye that vanish when I turn to look. Most prominent things are I can sometimes hear music so vividly before sleeping that it may as well be playing from a speaker, and just recently I heard an unfamiliar voice for a brief second. As far as I know, I don't have any mental conditions (severe, at least) so I was curious if it could be my sleep pattern. I've been averaging 3-6 hours a night, and I thought I've been handling it well, and tend to feel worse when I get more sleep. Any ideas?
Definitely, I think you should go get some sleep. Lack of sleep is a textbook explanation for symptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia. The best thing to do is turn off your electronics, get comfortable and get some much needed sleep. If the problems continue, don't let them get worse, go see your doctor asap!
I'm 17 male. This is NOT good. This could be from the lack of sleep. Yet,u don't want more. Did u used to sleep longer
I believe it is best to eat a healthy diet that includes a sensible amount of both carbs and proteins, but minimal amounts of processed foods. Low carb diets are often good to get started on a weight loss program if you need to lose weight, but are not good in the long term.
I don't follow one. My macros for carbs is at 30%. Protein and fat are both at 35%
eat proper portions and do a little bit of exercise every day, even if it's just walking for an hour. other diets may work, but probably won't and you should just gradually develop healthy habits instead instead of doing something weird that people pinky promise will totally make you healthy and in shape with no effort required
how tf does a high carb diet work?
to a degree, but you do have to becareful losing too much weight in a too short amount of time can be dangerous
Not enough calories. It's less than a month. You can plan to lose about 10 pounds in that time. Eat 2000 healthy calories a day. If you don't have enough calories, your metabolism slows down and you don't lose weight.
No, you can't lose that much calories in a short amount of time.
I am a 36D and i love my breast area. I used to be 38DD but i lost weight. Now i want to loose belly but i dnt want my breast to go away...i kno u cant choose where to loose the fat but can u guys tell me how to tone them or tone chest area? I have weights. Also im going to be doing running, walking, and biking. Also because i have really big thighs so i dnt like them!!! So i must do leg exercise. I am 20, female and 165. I used to be 183 lbs. I gained weight due to birth control
Like you said you can't choose and you'll continue to lose fat in the breasts, stomach and thighs similar to how you've been losing it. You can build chest muscles to lift your breasts and provide a little muscle mass to replace some of the lost mass. Plus muscle doesn't sag. Try chest flies: http://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/de... . 3 sets, 8 repetitions per set, enough weight to make you a little sore. Rest every other day to recover. It sounds like your hormones are slightly imbalanced, possibly due to the birth control. A little bit of progesterone cream should move fat from your thighs to your breasts.
I am drinking Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea before my every meal as recommended. Besides the really pleasant and smooth taste, I noticed that this Teaa fixes my bowel problem, so constipation doesn't bother me any more. I've lost 8 lb gives me great energy no need for energy drinks anymore. Thanks Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea
You can't spot reduce (which you already know.) so as you continue to lose weight it will come off where it wants to. I would suggest doing some body weight training or if you have some weights you can do a full body program with them.
Sadly, whites make up only 62% of this country's population. About half of that fraction is male- do the math
Customarily, white male votes for Democrat candidates are magically manufactured in swing states as necessary.
She'll get it. She just won't get the OLD white male vote. Big difference.
I have never heard any democrat bragging about the minority vote. Democrats welcome everyone to the party. It is my opinion we should start referring to Americans, as Americans. What I think the Republican Party is feeling right now, is guilt. They created this monster with trump and his supporters, and as usual, they are now condemning him and them.
Maybe not but Donald Trump will end up fûcking her up the ârse.
"Minorities" are a growing voter bloc so their votes are becoming more important.

He's still human, so probably yes. Though I imagine he would try to hold it in whenever he is around other people (just the polite thing to do, especially for a person in his position). If that happened in front of me, I would ignore it like I do with anyone else. Especially for a person in his position, that could be an embarrassing thing, so it's best not to call attention to it. After all, he is human and these things happen, but his position is supposed to stand for more than that.
I'd say, "That reminds of a stupid question I saw on Yahoo! Answers as if the anti-theist was too stupid to realize that Catholics know the Pope is human. What utter ignorance and how truly representative of anti-theists in general, your holiness." Then we'd laugh, and though not religious myself, we'd go on with an INTELLIGENT discussion about religion unlike some people on Yahoo! too needy to remember not to waste the time of others with their juvenile delusions. Why do you ask?
I am sure he does, it is a "preview" of incoming "holy $#!+" and can be describes as some sort of "holy ghost". As to how one should react, I suppose engaging in a friendly competition, trying to out-fart him, would be indicated and be the polite thing to do.
I'd be all like, "Holy sh*t!" And he'd say, "No, just a fart this time."
Yes, everyone farts. If he farted in front of me I would laugh.
Ew
Well possibly by kicking him in the shin and telling him to fucckoff would probably be a reasonable assumption of my said actions. Atheist,
He probably has line like "smells like atheism in here" or such ready for such a case.
yes but they are holy and carry the power of God Almighty.
How many accounts do you have? Sheesh...
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme is a great product . Does exactly what it says. I did feel a slightly headache the next morning but it went away within a few hours . Would definitely buy again.
Make sure it is pointing up so it hides better, and think of something that distracts you as much as possible. Wear long T shirts or polos and always carry something you can put in front of you.
Well they are very common. All the boys you go to school with have the same issues. Just try to hide them. NORMAL.
There is not much you can do about it in school. If you get caught relieving yourself at school, you can get in serious trouble.
Figure it out. As others have to...
do nothing and be happy you get them
Is it yours?
Hide it. Duh.
Ermmm i have been noticing some white and dry around my clit from a very long time 2 years approx. its just around my clit its white and dry everytime i was it, appear again but i observed when i was it with hot or warm water is does not appear for 1-2 days or of it appears its usually very less. I also experienced some very little itching on my right vaginal lip. Whats wrong?
It is likely just discharge that got caught in there. You need to wash regularly under your clitoris hood. Pull it back and rub with your finger and just clean water to clean your clitoris and in the corners and crevices. Do not use soap there. If you allow discharge to build up there, it combines with dead skin cells to form smegma, a creamy substance that can get hard and cause problems.
Could be a mild yeast infection. You said itching!? Have you spoken to a dr!? Various reasons as to why you have it. But it's best to go consult a gynecologist. During your cycle, you will get various forms of discharge. You can also get yeast infections. Go to a dr when in doubt.
Just wash with water for a week and see if that helps. Or wash it with water and a little bit of vinegar. Believe me it helps.
It's snow
R u serious! U have had this issue for 2 years and never went to a doctor!!! That tells me u dnt get yearly check ups and it also tells me tht u dnt take showers everyday. Wow.
Sounds like yeast. Buy some Monistat cream and use it for a couple of days.
It sounds weird but sometimes I find tiny white bits of toilet paper in my clit, that could be what it is?
I don't think anything is wrong except for the fact that you might want to consider showing and using soap and water every day.... ?
Your experiencing puberty, frequent random erection is one of the changes that is happening in your body if you are in puberty, soon you will see pubic hair, leg hair, voice deepens then go high then goes back to normal... If you masterbate long enough you might see a precum which is a clear sticky liquid and later you will ejaculate a semen, a cloudy liquid, all of that is part of being a man. Have a nice day bro.
It's only annoying bc you're letting it get to you. It's part and parcel of puberty; all guys experience them, not just you. So being brassed off about it, is pointless and a waste of energy. If anyone bothers you, just say something like: it's got a mind of its own.
You must be a troll. Because if you were a real boy you would already know that all boys of all ages from Early Childhood on have random, spontaneous erections throughout the day. If you were a boy you would know that this is normal.
Puberty Start masturbating to do something with your hard penis.
Because you are 13 healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
It's normal you've reach puberty. You'll start to grow body hair and discover how to masturbate.
it's your hormones as you go through puberty, you would have stated growing taller, getting hair in all types of places starting to see muscles and become more manly, it's all normal, erections can be embarrassing at times, they happen at strange times, but you will get used to it and it's happening to all of your friends as well
Nah, its ok no need to worry, Im 14 and Im having ***** anytime. Btw Im having a ***** rn
Don't think of boys anymore.
Ask your girlfriend
Go to the doctor. Probably a urinary tract infection which any of us can get, at any time. It's as simple as peeing in a cup and the doctor's lab checks the urine to see if there is infection. It's not healthy to walk around with an infection.
Sounds like a UTI. Urinary tract infection. UTI's can happen to everybody and you don't have to have sex to get one. Nothing to be embarrassed about. If you see a doctor they will want to take a urine sample and then give you an antibiotic to clear up the infection.
UTI....see your doctor.
Extreme mood swings are a sign of mental illness.
Unless you have a impartial witness to what was said you don't really know for sure which one of you is having the false memory. Yeah sure extreme mood swings could be some sort of bipolar disorder, but that's not something us 'helpful' participants on Y/A can diagnose.
im not sure what is prompting him to act this way and need more details. people in relationships get into fights over stuff all the time so no it does not sound like a mental health issue from what you described.
why? do you HAVE erectile difficulties? if she's your GF and looks like Bigfoot, you be atracted to Bigfoot types so you shouldn;t have any problem getting aroused without medical help
How do you know what Bigfoot looks like?
The cartoons of Robert Crumb feature many hot Bigfoot women. https://www.google.com/search?q=cartoons+crumb+bigfoot&biw=1351&bih=635&tbm=isch&imgil=2Q_pBopLi4swyM%253A%253B1C1XW4QXaGZuBM%253Bhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.pinterest.com%25252Fpin%25252F289004501065759443%25252F&source=iu&pf=m&fir=2Q_pBopLi4swyM%253A%252C1C1XW4QXaGZuBM%252C_&usg=__gfhoqPy3qgBmMtAZcH_wa1sfaYI%3D&ved=0ahUKEwjQ_L-Q_-XMAhVDchQKHe-tApIQyjcILQ&ei=3Z09V5CaCsPkUe_bipAJ#imgrc=_ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Crumb
So what does that say about you? Cant get a decent woman....
When you are hungry, eat anything you want as long as you are sure it's food. When you are not hungry, stop eating. I followed that plan for 40 years and my weight didn't vary more than three pounds.
I personally know people that don't eat that much maybe small snacks or cookies and they are fat is like is not the amount of junk food you eat, junk food is just bad, but who knows everybody is different the thing is that a small portion of junk food sometimes has more fat and calories than a small portion of non-fat food.
Yes
It depends if you do some sport or some activity to burn it after. If yes, you should not be afraid of anything. But chips are not really healthy.
No way to tell, as there are hundreds of variables that decide a persons weight...
You'll be fine
Probably Not.
sperm takes about 6 to 70 days to mature and be ready to ejaculate, so built up sperm supplies would need to mature and be ejaculated/die off before he is "clear" of viable sperm. So 3 months is a good time to ensure that has happened.
The point of a vasectomy is to prevent viable sperm from being present in the ejaculation. But the sperm is still produced as it would be in a man without a vasectomy; it just does not go out the usual route. Sperm has a limited life span -- days at most, so the idea of having to ejaculate x number of times is misleading at best. It simply dies, and gets absorbed back into the body, and then more is "created" as it is needed.
No. There is still a potential for viable sperm to be alive in the testes. Just use a condom for awhile if you don't want to do the 20 times thing.
Oh yes - work as much as you can - stay out in the world as much as you can. Anxiety/depression fall under "neurosis" - they're not much fun, but they are fairly normal and harmless. However, if a guy tries to protect himself too much he can end up just not going anywhere or doing anything. Slowly of course you want to try and understand the underlying conflicts which give you this anxiety/depression. And then they'll go away and leave you alone. But in the meantime, you don't want to fall under their spell anymore than necessary.
I tried it and ended up in a mental hospital for 5 1/2 months You could try if you're confident but there are charity shops e.c.t that specialise in hiring people with mental disorders if that makes sence.
You need to overcome adversity and still live a functional life. I would see help with ways of handling it more sufficiently. It is wise.
I have the same things and I'm giving it a shot let's hope we don't drop dead, and good luck.
yeah. try not to bother other people with that shxt though. its bad for morale.
you can work if you take your medication
Me and my bf have been fooling around. He can't get me off.. He does oral, fingering, and he has even used a vibrator on me. He focuses on my clit and plays with my vagina too. He is very good at it and has experience with this. I can get myself off with my own fingers when I'm alone, why can't I orgasm with him? I get to the point where my legs twitch and shake, but that's all that happens. Its not an orgasm. What is wrong with me? This happened with my last bf too. Is something wrong with my vagina? I can climax on my own, but not with someone else...
Sam is pretty much on target, boys are pretty much clueless, different girls like different things, there are no manuals for pleasing all girls. It can be a hit or it can be a miss, 1 wrong movement can make a female miss it. Since you know how to get your own self off, you may have to do it and let him watch, think you can do that? It might even make it more exciting for you. There's nothing wrong with your vagina, it may just need some more attention.
Broadly speaking, men and women differ when it comes to achieving orgasm with a partner. Men can separate love and affection from arousal & orgasm. With women love, affection, arousal, orgasm, AND trust are five components of a whole. Some psychologists refer to female orgasm as a barometer of a woman's feelings for her partner. When they find the right guy for whom they feel affection, love, & trust, arousal and orgasm will come, often quite unexpectedly. The orgasm is a signal to the woman's body that "this is the right guy".
Most sensitive spot on the penis is on the lower side of the shaft, right below the head. But for a huge climax (girls orgasm, guys climax) you need to be emotionally as well as physically turned on.
Yes, there is. Although, he's the kicker, jason. The spot is only 50 nanometers in diameter, and you must touch ONLY THAT one spot to trigger 100% of your nerves of your prostate. It's on everyone's penis, except it's in a different spot for every penis. I've been looking for mine for nearly 20 years, now.
No, but there are sensitive parts of your penis thatl make you cvm and feel really great like the frenulum or the glans rim.
Well the head or "glans" is where most of the nerves are and if you stimulate that then you will have a "huge orgasm."
Putting a vibrator on the near the hole of the penis makes *** so much.
Lol
Tickle your anus while masterbating
Well there is nothing wrong with them. Just go in and change. The worse that will happen is someone see you naked. After you do this several times it won't be a big deal then go take a shower in a public shower bare naked. Same thing after several times it won't be a big deal. Its important that you be comfortable in your own skin.
Best to just confront your fears and do what other guys are doing- strip off and change and act like it is normal- -which it is. Better to force yourself to just go ahead and use the changing room and you'll get used to being undressed or nude around other guys-- would be certainly an advantage to be able to go in and change or shower without being apprehensive. So go for it.
If you are scared of public changing rooms, don't use them. Or use family rooms or unisex change rooms.
Just strip off you will soon get used to being around other naked bodies.
Wear a longer shirt. That way, when you change, you will be covered.
Get a grip. Your body is no different than any other male on the planet.
Change is a toilet cubicle with the door shut. Simple.
see an eye doctor
only if you are over 65
A group of people who claim to be from a hacker group have decided to believe in the lies I've been posting about myself for the last 4 months as a violent person and paedophile where they basically stated that I'm a paedophile who should also be denied from attending any programs involving a series of light flashes and distorted sounds that would change person, and they were posting these on parenting forums. I believe these metrosexual programs may or may not consist of a series of flashing lights and/or distored sounds. I'm feeling very left out towards everyone. I didn't do any of those lies I said about myself.
Yoshi this sh!t has got to stop ok. Stop defaming yourself,get offline,go outside and embrace the sunshine
There is no such thing as a 'metrosexual program', therefore no one is turning you away from programs. And you've been posting 'lies' about being a paedophile for more than four years - not four months! Isn't it time you came up with something more believable to bleat on about? Something that might look like a legitimate question could be a good start, rather than concocting sickening psychological problems
Get off your computer and actually do stuff! Like: Bike riding Playing with pets Going out places like the park or the mall Read a book Ask one of your friends or siblings to play a game with you, like soccer or football or jump-roping or even tag! and etc. Hike with family or friends Go on a road trip Go to the gym to exercise And basically anything besides going online
Get off social media; you are abusing it. Find better things to do: hiking, biking, sports, exercise, get a dog and teach it tricks. Find big happy churches, attend some age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Be truthful from now on.
I'd look for an online course. A Diploma of Metrosexual Psycho Hypnosis could be a very handy qualification in these uncertain times. .
I will sit tight in a meditative posture in a serene atmosphere and do honest and sincere prayers with implicit faith, unshakable belief and unflinching devotion to God Almighty.
As I grew older I realized that I was no longer good in bed as I used to before and that actually made me sad and this Prolargentsize product can be used by adults of all age groups which has made me feel amazing. I don't only have increased stamina , but I also feel younger.
Nope
no, other than a magnifying glass
lens
no ma'am
No.
I'll send you a package full of yellow poop today.
eat a lot of yellow food dye and you will achieve your aim. If you want orange, than drinking a lot of carrot juice. If you want red, then a lot of tomato juice will do the trick. The brown color comes from breakdown product from your blood.
Yellow Poop is caused by LIVER DISEASE, which can be fatal
Eat orange foods.
eat all yellow food then
Go whine to your mommy like the cry baby troll you are and ask HER! I honestly could care less about your bowel movements and even LESS about YOU!!!
America. Look at what the Dimocrats did to the Weavers, look at what they did to the Branch Davidians, and the Reps aren't much better. The government is way out of control, and it's due to big government Leftism. They think your kid is actually their kid.
You miss the point. No government in the world is capable of preventing stupid people from doing stupid things. The beauty of a democracy backed by a constitution is that stupid things can be corrected. The mom did not face charges and it was the cops who were found to be in violation of the law.
Your imagination. Is the reason you never link to these "events" because you get them all from questionable sources like infowars.com? Or is it because if you linked to the story it would become obvious to everyone else that you didn't read the whole thing and took a headline out of context?
I'm 14. 5 foot 9 inches. And I weigh 310lbs. My tummy is really really big. I haven't seen my feet since I was 9. I LOVE eating so much. But I don't fit in my desk at school. I keep breaking chairs. I can't turn around in some bathroom stalls cause my tummy is too big. But I LOVE eating food. And I hate exercise. I'm about to go eat an extra large pizza, 3-4 triple cheeseburgers and a cheesecake. Am I too fat? Or should I just ignore it?
Yes, 310 lbs is overweight. I would suggest exercising.
You're mordibly obese
yes. you should reduce to at least 200.
There is no need to seek an MD because the pharmacist can give you a pill to get you going. Only if that didn't work would I seek the MD.
I would not going longer than 5 days.
The only thing can be done is to take fiber,and eat enough.Not enough food causes it too.Exercise can help some.
One week if during that week fiber, water, prunes, and OTC medication weren't working.
It's a long slow road. The fact you've been able to go for 8 months is a step forward, though you don't see it or feel it right now. You're learning skills you need; one day you will wake up and it will all just click. Could take a long time, could be next week. But it really does happen.
Therapy , counselling hardly ever workout. God loves you seek him and he'll be there too guide and fill your emptiness trust me he's really the only answer at the end of the road God bless you
Not awkward necessarily, the experience of the partner has a great deal to do with it. Does it 'hurt'? Not exactly, but it is an odd sensation, I will grant you, but the feelings that follow make you forget that moment quickly.
Sex is always awkward, that never changes. And yes, there can be discomfort sometimes.
Only if you are squeamish. I could go into details, but it is a waste of time.
do not have sex until youre married
Are you referring to your priest?
I had a bad stomach ache yesterday but it didn't last more then 20 or 30 minutes. Then I was able to get on with my day. But this morning I had black poop. ( It wasn't tarry however) and a few more of my bowl movements where this color but then a few became dark brown. Should I be worried? I havw ulcerative colitis and stomach ulcers. I'm not on any medication right now ( waiting to start humira) and nothing in my diet could have caused this.
Poop is brown because it contains dead blood cells processed by the liver.....black poop typically indicates blood that has been through the digestive process, which would make sense if you have been suffering from ulcerative colitis and stomach ulcers....not a good thing, but in your case likely nothing to be overly concerned about....
A one-time change in color is usually related to diet. If this keeps happening for several days straight, then it might be time to have a stool sample tested for blood. If you want a stool sample tested, call your doc's office to make arrangements.
1. Sudden change in poop's colour is due to dietary changes. 2. You may take it easy and forget. 3. If repeated again and again, you may see a doctor.
Are you taking iron pills? Did you take pepto bismol because that can cause your stools to turn dark. If not, you should get that checked out right away.
Temporary changes in stool color is usually due to something that you ate. Eating Palak Paneer (Indian spinach & cheese) or otherwise eating a lot of cooked spinach does it to me. Cooked spinach has about 6.5 mg of iron / cup in it. I LOVE Palak Paneer so when I eat it, I eat a LOT of it!
Stop eating meat, try to vegetables habits
Iron pills will cause black stools.
You're tall compared to me. I'm almost 16 and 5'0. I believe the height average for women is 5'4, and most women get most of their growth height wise around ages 14-16. So if you stay this height you will be basically average height. You could grow a bit more though.
It's average if your a girl. Your short if your a boy. Im 14 and 5-9 and i feel short
I was only 5'2 around 13 and now I'm 16 and 5'9. My whole family is pretty tall, dad is 6'6 and mum is 5'9. It's all got to do with genetics really (: maybe you'll hit a nice growth spurt!
You are still going through puberty so growth spurts can happen at any moment, but you are around average height. I know a few 13 year olds who are 5'5, 5'7' and 5'9, and I also know a few 14 year olds who are 5'1, and 4'11. But 66 inches (5'5) is the suggested height for 14-15 year olds.
You are not tall your are short. People nowadays are always shorter due to added hormones. The standard for being considerably tall is 5'8, 5'9, 5'10 and so on
I don't think 5'3 is excessively short for a 14 year old. I was 5'3 in the beginning of 7th grade and then I grew to like 5'6 by the end of the year
I'm 12 and 5' 6" I think 5' 3" is pretty short buy I'm a giant so can't really relate
I'm a 18 year old boy and only a couple of inches taller than you, O know I'm short but don't care. My Girlfriend is taller than me to :-)
I'm 13 and I'm 5'10 I'm taller than everyone in my grade and most of my teachers, compared to me you are short. But you are about average
I was reading an article in Cosmo about which professions have the smallest penis size (IT), and largest (teachers). Assuming that this is correct- you have to take a leap here- what would happen if someone studied IT & teaching and became an IT man or computers teacher at a school? Would they have a large or small penis?
Obviously I went to the wrong school. Wonder how Cosmo did it's research. Explains all this craze for Adult education. < M
Whoever wrote that article in Cosmo was writing a load of unverified and unverifiable garbage. Penis size is purely genetically determined and is not affected by one's choice of profession - neither does it influence the choice (except perhaps as a porn actor!)
mmm I don't think that's common. I played field hockey in hs however I was really aggressive to the point I would pass up making a goal to **** someone up which pissed off a lot of my team mates so I ended up transferring to weights/gym and all the guys there were in it for themselves not to attract women. This is generally my view of other males who bulk. I'm pretty sure majority do it for themselves not others so no they are not pathetic. I think people who have this view have internalised jealousy and try to deflect so they are actually the pathetic ones.
That's a pretty stupid assessment. Some people might think you're pathetic. What does it matter what anyone thinks? Particularly what you think...
Vain men are just like vain women- they primp or work out or dress up to impress other members of their sex more so than to impress the opposite sex.
only if they attract other men instead.
yes
not all men do it for that reason and they do it for themselves
Dunno = most of them do it to attract other men. < M
Well if the transexual has no artificial vagina, the only way the straight guy can have sex is just oral sex or mutual masturbation or anal penetration. Is he gay? Of course not-- gay means you are only attracted to and have sex with other guys. This straight guy can have sex with a guy masquerading as a female just for fun, and then go have sex with girls. May have had a homosexual act but does not "make" him gay.
No. He looks like a girl right?! So no it doesn't make you gay. I would love to have sex with a transexual woman. Sounds like a fun experience.
Of course. Thats NOT straight sex.
Ans-------- > https://tr.im/green1greenlink
nah, just a tranny fuc ker. Not exactly straight if you seek to fuc k people with dix.
That is gay.
No.
I'm 14 i masturbate around twice or three times a day, awhile back i learned that your supposed to clean under your foreskin or else smega builds up, but i pulled the skin back and now it doesnt cover my head comepletely ( the pink part) under the foreskin and its senitive and hurts when i touch it, what am i suppssed to do, when im flaccid the skin just hangs off the tip of my penis? Please help im worried and confused
just do a search for "caring for the foreskin on penis" you'll get all kinds of hits on do's and dont's.......in the meantime, yes, the uncovered penis is quite sensitive when touched with foreskin pulled back.....there are stretching techniques too, so that you can get an erection without the pain of a foreskin that won't open up properly
I'm 17, I have two baby teeth still in my mouth, and they need to be pulled. After they're pulled, I'll need surgery to remove some of my gum and tissue to get the other two teeth pulled down far enough to get braces to pull them down the rest of the way. They're teeth near the front of my mouth. Will I put under to go through the surgery? Or only numbing?
I would think that if the dentist is just extracting a tooth (or teeth) that are already visible he would just use an anesthetic. However, some dentist prefer an oral surgeon to do everything in-case of an emergency (not that you will have one). I would speak with the dentist or an office manager and go over your treatment plan and see what exactly needs to be done and if everything is being done on one specific day or spread out over a period of time.
They don't like to do general anaesthetic unless necessary. Impacted wisdom teeth are essentially the only proceedures I can think of that require it or heavily suggest it. There are probably more procedures but...I've had two root canals, two extractions, numerous fillings, and a procedure surround a golf-ball sized abscess in my jaw, and I was never put under general anaesthetic for any of those. Local anaesthetic covers a wide range and you'd be surprised how much pain it'll cover.
You'll be put under. Numbing wouldn't work to well on its own for a surgery like that. Be sure to brush your teeth well for the next few days to avoid infections.
I'm pretty sure they'll just inject you with anesthetic to numb your mouth and then start fixing your teeth
I would talk to your dentist and find out if it would be possible to do the whole thing in one shot
Right this has been bugging me for aaaages - Sex is supposed to feel good to encourage us to do it and to reproduce, right? If that s the case, why is the clitoris located OUTSIDE THE BODY??? Most women can t have orgasms without direct clitoral stimulation, so why is that going to make us want to have intercourse? Are we girls just poorly designed or is there a legit reason it s not inside the vagina? This has been bugging me for ages now please help 10 points
all embryos start as female. which is why the clitoris is made of the same erectile tissue as a penis. you would not expect a man to get pleasure from sex without his penis being stimulated so why expect a woman to get pleasure without any clitoral stimulation? it is not poor design to have 8000 nerve endings for the sole purpose of sexual pleasure in the clitoris. Child birth is painful enough without needing to have 8000 nerve endings in the vagina instead.
The clitoris is just one sensitive part. The g-spot, located inside the vagina usually inside upper wall and feels like a raisin when deflated is the other sensitive part that can bring on orgasms.
theres this pleasurable feeling for me when i do have sex probably due to the erotic area also known as the g spot. there are also some sexual positions that stimulate not only the g spot but the clitoris as well.
As a guy with a small penis, 4 inches erect tbh, I'm glad it's outside! :) Giving oral sex is the only way I can make a woman orgasm. If I skip the oral, she gets almost no pleasure. There, now you know! :)
You don't need to have an orgams to enjoy sex. It's very pleasurable even without an orgasm.
Its nice to have a penis bae! It doesnt flop around coz i wear boxerz everytime, and i never sat on it coz its not long enough to cover my balls and my ***, when erect my penis go upward hard. Peeing in flacid vs peeing in hard erection are two different thing. Peeing flaccid is as normal as it is, i just stand and shoot but peeing in erection is far more difficult than what you think, pee will shoot everywhere if i didnt angle myself to the toilet. Or find a nice position to target the toilet bowl. An erect penis is harder to control than flaccid.
It's just there baby! It don't flop unless I drop. Mine isn't long enough to sit on unless I'm erect, and when I'm erect I'm standing tall so there's no chance of me sitting on it. I pee standing up, I pee sitting down. I can pee in the shower or in the bushes. Whatever and however I feel like it.
It's fun. Sometimes I throw it over my shoulder and burp it.
Go play somewhere else kid.
so basically i open my labia and see some structure and is assume its my hymen idk...anyways i just recently got a little worried so i tried exploring up my vagina. i put a finger in and there are like things in me, like it just feels like I'm touching weird structures but I'm rly worried about what the hell is in me! I have used tampons before but it was a little hard to do so maybe there is something blocking my vagina! also my period has been lighter. help
The vagina isn't shaped like a cardboard tube. It's lumpy, folded skin with muscles, bones, and organs around it. If nothing is hurting or smelling foul, you're A okay.
Well you don't have a hymen that's for sure
Is your foot fetish that bad that you think you would attack random strangers and try to give them foot massages without their consent? Lol. If not then you should be fine. I think my boyfriend has a bit of a foot fetish because he gives me foot massages and is obsessed with my feet. lol.. just behave like a human being in public then you'll be fine. When you get a girlfriend you can play with her feet all the time, if she's into that kind of thing. Best thing about girls wearing flip flops at your college is that you can see who has pretty feet and who doesnt easily. lol
Easier said then done, but do not make eye contact with their feet.
Yes it would change my perspective of him.
whip it out
5'8 130 lbs. I eat all organic; about 2000 calories a day, and exercise about 4 times a week :)) I have about 23% body fat too
6 foot tall, 150 pounds, 35 bust 26 waist 36 hips, 23~% body fat, and I eat between 1800 and 2300 calories per day
I never bother to measure. I just eat healthy and go on with my life. I am not obsessed with my weight. Calories? I never even give it at thought. All I know is I lose a pound a week. No complaints here.
5'7 133 , 3000 calories 33-26-37
5'2 feet, 127 lbs, the rest I don't know but I probably eat around 1000 - 1200 calories on a normal day.
5'4" 112lbs 32 in. bust 24 in. waist 34 in. hips, 25% body fat, & im vegan so i shove as many calories as i can in a day
5'6, 131 lbs, 34-25-38, 22 years old 20% body fat (trying to drop it down to 17%!!)
I live entirely in a non-corporeal form, mainly as the energy required to depress these keys.
im 5ft 6..i weigh 8st...i eat so many calories but dont gain the weight , i work out every other day , i will never let myself become obese . i like my figure , but i would prefer a bigger backside :)
I'm 5'7 and 130 pounds. Bra size is 36DD
I eat healthy. I never eat junk foods and packed foods. I am too weak to exercise. I am a basketball player. I could exercise a lot before my problem started. And I sleep without waking up in the middle. But even I sleep for 12 hours a day, it's not sufficient for me. I had to stop my college because of my extreme weakness and headache. Doctors couldn't figure out anything.
Are you eating a healthy diet rich in protein, vegetables, and fiber.... or do we eat a lot of junk food and sodas? Do you exercise daily... Or do you lay around and play video games? Do you go to bed at normal decent time and get proper amount of sleep... or are you up half the night? Don't even consider asking what's wrong with you, and don't even consider going to a doctor if any of these apply to you. Make lifestyle changes and see what happens to your health.
Have you been to a doctor?
Its short to a 5 ft. 9 guy.
Less than 2" shorter than average for a guy in the US. Not "short", but shorter. Absolutely within the normal range for height.
It's a bit short. If you are under age 20, you may continue to grow taller. Depends on your genes. You can appear taller with elevator shoes/boots, hats and spikey hair.
Average in the US is 5'8.5", but going down due to the huge influx of Mexican ancestry males who are generally shorter than that.
It is a little below average.
Below average.
Stand next to your friends and see. So much for a question... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
Very good size. That's a lot bigger than mine and I'm 17.
Very good size, in top 10% of all males. I'd delete that last sentence. You might get creepy people contacting you.
not not a good size that is small 12 inch is perfect size
Yes. No.
Hi whenever i insert a tampon the first time i can easily do it, then it gets dirty, i take it off and try to put a new one but then my vagina is too dry and it's really hard to push it. So i always use tampon then pad and then tampon again but i hate using pads. What should i do? Does that happen to you? No trolls, thanks.
I don't understand all the trouble that young girls have using a tampon. I started using tampons when I was 14 (back in the day when dinosaurs were still roaming the Earth). I NEVER had any problem putting one in or taking one out. Of course, I had read the instructions before the first time I attempted to use one.
Using plastic applicators will make the insertion process much easier than cardboard ones. That being said, don't try to force the tampon in. You may just be angling it incorrectly, or you may be unconsciously tensing your vaginal muscles. Relax, get into a comfortable position (try with one leg standing on the floor, the other on the toilet seat) and try again. You can always wait a few minutes until you can use some blood as a type of lubricant to help the process. Little gross sounding, but it works. Good luck :)
Use the guide below to learn about properly inserting a tampon. Some girls have "extra" tissue that can interfere with inserting tampons. This is called a septate hymen; the "string" of tissue down the center is called a "strand." If you have a hymenal strand, it can make it difficult and painful to put in a tampon.
You can use some sort of lubricant when you insert the tampon, but not a scented lotion (that might burn).... use some coconut or olive oil or a small amount of vaseline.
If you havent already thrown up, I would just wait it out. If it sticks around for more than a few hours I would at least call a doctor or something. The human body is pretty resilient when it comes to eating odd things
Sorry you had to learn that lesson the hard way, not a good idea. Eat something such as a sandwich to help absorb the oil.
It will just make a bowel movement easier and it will make you feel sick if you drank a lot.
You're crazy. And yes, now you are sick to your stomach.
never drink that. drink honey and lemon mixture or something like that. Jeez.
Go to the doctor
Wow that was dumb
I was fortunate enough to have been circumcised as a baby. However a good friend of mine chose to get himself circumcised at 23 years old. Full recovery took the usual average of about 6 weeks, but he was able to resume masturbation after about 4 weeks. Please see http://www.circinfo.com/post-op_care/car... for useful information on the post-op care of a new circumcision.
I was circumcised when i was 15 and took my a week to fully recovered. And a day or so i have my first bj with my buddy.
No but I was circumsized as a baby
no, I ma not so mad...

Guys don't know what is what when it comes to vaginas - especially young guys. And vaginas are like penises, noses, eyes, lips, facial shapes -- they are all different.
Good. It usually means you should have an easier time having sex. Guys only care what it feels like, not what it looks like
Stop worrying that sounds fantastic, I love a good cameltoe
they are all beautiful and yours sounds great
If it is pointing up it must be somewhat hard, in order to do that. Normal for the penis to get harder right before climax too and even get a bit bigger.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme makes my physical reactions more responsive. It helps me to have longer lasting fun. My wife noticed and was surprised by the differences. But of course, I did not tell her anything about any supplements. I felt great!
Yes it's normal, you have to be aroused for your penis to get hard.
Attribute it to individual difficulties. You may benefit from some of the medical formulations such as Viagra.
real life is not a porn movie. a large % of men have not a full hard erection, expecially if have a big or long penis
You might be eating irregular or taking some substances that makes your muscles weaker. It will probably be okay after a while.
Yes. It's not going to get hard until your aroused.
You may have blood pressure problems, or you always are drunk/on drugs (illegal or prescription)
Get off your *** and exercise more.
This question isnt very clear. Are you asking where as in a place? Then the privacy of your bedroom or shower could be options. If you are asking where as in how then thats another answer entirely.
anywhere you want. school bathrooms, classroom. infront of family. have fun with it just dont get caught.
In your bedroom
Where ever you want to...
I would totally love to see a guy eat his own semen... nasty, bitter stuff (unless you're an alcoholic then it's kinda sweet). See how convincing you are that we (females) swallow after having a taste yourself.
I wouldn't care if they did I wouldn't eat semen for anyone. That's disgusting.
I don't think they care. Away it's up to the guy whether he does or not. I have- it tastes good. Once after cumming inside my wife I went down on her to make her *** and ate my *** in the process.
Probably better than finding out that Cartman killed your parents, baked them into a pie and tricked you into eating that.
if they are feminists yes, to humiliate, disgrace and dehuminze men and the men who comply will make up all sorts of excuses to justify that abuse, like in the stockholm syndrom, because the men experience the emotional connection to a woman very intense and are afraid to loose it if they stop justifying the abuse to break free.
Just their own? How weak. Hook up a pipe and make them take 50 loads. 😏
No but I found it funny when one of my mates admitted to taste testing his own.
No idea from mental health point of view.
My ex liked it
Lol, omg, No I would think it was strange.
I'm 17 male. Disease causing fatigue,dizziness,migraines and more 24/7 all very chronic(IM SERIOUS). It's genetic and an incurable hell disease. Getting worse. Life is literally pointless. And I am full of hatred towards everything and everyone. It's deep hatred. Not temper. Actual hate. I feel hatred towards God if he exists. I said aloud I'd kill him. I am losing my sanity to my disease. What should I do
I’m so glad that you decided to reach out for some support today. It sounds like you’re really struggling with a lot at the moment. It’s important that you let somebody close to you know how you’re feeling if you’re not already doing so. A trusted friend, relative, counselor, therapist, or doctor would be a good place to start. Working together, you can come up with some coping strategies to work through these difficult symptoms and feel better. Know that you’re not alone and that there are people and resources out there that can help you. Please continue to reach out for support. PF, Counselor
You are being driven mad. Directed to hate...hate God, hate some ppl. Driven. That is satanical. I don't believe you want to serve satan. I don't know why RW got so upset, doesn't make sense. I think unless you pray, you'll be consumed; I don't know why. Just 17. How long have you had this? It's not JUST satan, ok? Satan attacks weakness, makes it worse You'll need to express this...in drawing, or writing to get some relief. God helps ppl, and you need it.
Well God does exist, Its the devil and his demons that are causing all of you diseases, why do people think God is heartless when he has more love than anything, Ask jesus to help you because he can
Talk to Jehovah''s witnesses They can show you a reason to feel otherwise.
You don't have any disease, you lying twit. You're just a fυcking whack job, a real loser.
Jesus died for you for our sins. Receive Him as your Lord. Then He will heal you. read the Bible. he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the Son he loves, 14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
If you have an earache then you should see a doctor. Onion juice doesn't fix an ear infection. Antibiotics do cure earaches if it is a bacterial infection.
1. Imprudent to try onion juice, which is pungent. 2. Internal homoeo medicine can give you total relief. 3. Ear ache— Mixture of CF 3x, CP 3x or 12x, FP 12x, KM 3x, KP 3x, KS 3x, MP 3x and NS 3x; failing which mixture of CS 3x, NM 3x, NP 3x, and S 12x, Puls 6 is also very useful and often cures. Dosage*: 2 grains t.d.s. • All these biochemic salts/homeo medicines available @ local Homoeo shops, are safe and with side benefits. Don’t swallow medicine. The medicine to be dissolved on/under the tongue. Don’t take any thing 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after medication. You can take water.
First find out what's causing the pain and then treat that.
You heard nonsensical old wives' tales.
Never heard of an 'ounion'.
Please see a Dr. Putting vegetable juice in your ears is really silly and possibly harmful.
I was using the self-clean option of my oven and one of my roommates made a spill they neglected to tell me about. The oven started smoking...a lot. I was afraid the house would catch fire so I opened the windows and stayed inside. I covered my mouth with a moist dish cloth. My eyes were watering and it was hard to breathe but I wanted to be around to be able to try and contain the fire or at least know to call 911 if there was a fire. Should I seek medical care? I'm still coughing hours later.
Fumes inhale?.... wow
As many as your little heart desires, as long as you don't inhale so many you need medical care.
fumes of what? Ricin? none scented candles? lungs full.
From those numbers, it sounds like you don't need to lose more weight. It also sounds like you're not consuming enough calories per day. My advice would be to speak to a registered dietitian. They are very knowledgeable on how much food a person should be eating. You can still like unhealthy foods but have an eating disorder. From what you've said, it sounds like you do have an eating disorder. Red flags for me are the calorie counting, calorie restriction, exercising to "make up" for eating, and manipulating medication to lose weight. It is important to eat a varied diet, incorporating fruits, vegetables, and meats. I am concerned for you. You should ask a registered dietitian for some advice.
I purchased this Weight Loss Idealiss Pills in hopes of using it to shed my holiday weight. I have a read that this a great fat burner. You get the energy and it gets you through a workout with ease plus for me I like the non crash and the fact that I don't have the jittery feel as I have with other fat burners. All in all this is a great supplement.
Yes, you're destroying yourself. You also have a body image disorder. You need professional help. Getting all your calories from small amounts of garbage is insane. You need nourishment. You need lots of nutritious food, then have a small amount of junk. You need therapy. BTW, calorie counting is dumb. Especially when you ignore all the stuff your body needs. Stop destroying your body.
You could up the calories a little bit but besides that it doesn't really sound like you do. Maybe a bit ocd with the counting....
you are definitely going to grow a little more, you're only 14! I'd say though 5'4 is a fine height to be, im 20 and that's how tall I am and I'm fine with it, but whether you're tall, short, thin, fat, round, hourglass or whatever you're you and that's great! I think you'll probably have one more growth spurt and then maybe grow a tiny bit at a time till you're around 16/18, everyone's different, I stopped growing when i was around 16 I think.
It's different as I am a guy, but I grew from 5'3 to 5'11 in 14 months.
Anything it's possible. But there is no way anyone on here can know what your height is going to be.
5ft 4 to 5ft 5 is the average height of adult western females. You are probably finished growing or nearly so. Anything now, if at all, will be minor
Highly unlikely. Women stop round 15. Many before. Nothing you can do. Don't get scammed.
Most males do not finish growing until 15-18.
Not if you have started periods. < M
Many males involuntarily ejaculate with anal stimulation since the stimulation often presses on and stimulates the prostate.
You'd probably need a prostate massager. I've never been able to do it with my fingers alone. I can't even ejaculate by using my ********* alone. But when I do use my vibrating *********, and masturbate as it is in my anus, my god, do I get the most intense orgasms ever.
shouldnt be a problem, find an organ donor
Ans-------- > https://tr.im/green2greenlink
it's called prostate milking and if it's done right and when you ejaculate it would be amazing
I can make my bf kum by phucking him. No hands.
who?
This is your ignorance, thinking that only cancer is the result of swollen lymphs. That's not true, could be 100 different things or nothing at all. So you're overreacting about little until you go to the doctor and they decide what's going on.
You are a teenager who has been obsessing about their health for far to long already. PLEASE stop looking up symptoms on the internet. Self diagnosing is the first thing a medical student is taught NOT to do as it is so foolish and yet you are continually doing it with no medical knowledge whatsoever. If you are unwell, tell a parent or guardian so they can access if you need to see a doctor. Swollen lymph nodes are generally a sign of a healthy, active immune system, as you have been told MANY times. You possibly have a mild virus.
Even though that may not be cancer, I would see my doctor asap for a proper diagnoses!
No clue. Go to the doctor if you're scared
I'm surprised your parents haven't taken you to the doctor because you are obviously underweight and suffering from anorexia. You need to see a psychiatrist. While I know you are suffering mentally - I still can't get over the fact that you are giving your sister a complex too - and she will end up being anorexic before this is all over. You have doomed her to your mental condition. You're an as5hole. You both should go to the doctor together.
You should sincerely apologize to her, and you can do with gaining some weight yourself. You shouldn't be 17 and only 85 pounds. Get help for yourself, and don't let her turn into you with your pathetic fat jokes.
She will get over it I'm sure
Sisters and brothers always squabble, she probably is more mature than you - things will get much better
get some therapy or something and stop being a jerk and gain some weight before you get put into the hospital for anorexia
Man created by God? Product of Evolution or Seeded on earth by Extraterrestrials? ~~~ 'Creation' is impossible! Next?
Order of probability in my eyes from most likely to least likely 1) Evolved 2) Seeded 3) God did it
Or, what the facts suggest - Created by God through biological evolution.
Evidence of evolution: Mountains and mountains of it, from converging scientific disciplines. Evidence of God: None Evidence we were seeded by ETs: None
Science has nothing to do with origins it can only speculate on things that already are. As Ernst Mayr once said when we get data we attach a historical narrative....separate the two
Retarded people believe gods created plants before they created the sun. Sad and humorous at once :0
Do you wish to separate God from evolution?
Gen 1:27 God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. There you have it. God said it and that settles it!
Man was created by God. We just don't know how he did it.
Sounds like anemia or low blood sugar. If you get iron pills, here's a tip: If the pills make you constipated or give you gas, try proferrin brand. It's the only one I've taken that has no side effects. It costs a lot but it's worth it. I prefer the capsules rather than the tablets, because the tablets don't dissolve completely, they come out in the toilet.
I am also in the same position as you and I'm worried I am anaemic. Apparently it is a lot more common in females, they lose blood once a month on their periods, and due to this they lose iron. ARe your periods heavy at all? If they are this could cause it. I have not yet had these tests so I am not sure what happens though.
No, of course not. The whole point of circumcision is to prevent masturbation. It is not a treatment for Phimosis, which usually cures itself. You probably are O.K. = it is the erection itself that is usually the problem = not ejaculation. < M
Yes, after a period of 18 days it is perfectly fine and safe to do this.
Disregard Merlin. He gave you terribly false information.
nope, wait other 2 weeks at least
Nope. Over 200 guys die every year in America alone from septic cirks. That is quite a side effect. < M
I was at 16. It's not that bad at all. Just keep it clean and medicated and the healing process goes pretty fast. Not a big deal.
I'm 24 also an uncut , don't plan on doing it fine just the way it is
Yes, at the age of 23. I recommend it. No problems & cost is not relevant.
If you were not having a period at the time you tried to use one, it could feel "weird" and it could hurt when you took it out. A tampon is designed to absorb menstrual flow. If you insert one and you are NOT menstruating, it will ALSO absorb your normal vaginal discharge. In other words, you will be "dry inside", and therefore you can feel it inside you and it can hurt when you try to remove it.
Don't use tampons on your light days at first. If your flow is adequate, you won't feel it in or when it's being removed.
On all such genuine doubts you should always strictly listen to the good words of advice from a professionally qualified doctor. Please don't jump into any hasty or wrong steps.
You probably didn't put it in far enough or used the wrong absorbency
dry=friction=pain
If it is in correctly, you do NOT feel it at all. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03G9H5H8...
First and foremost, no matter what he says, yes he did know he ejaculated inside you. Guys know when it is about to happen, just like women know when they are about to have an orgasm. And no, you don't need plan B. If it makes you feel better, go ahead and get it, but it isn't necessary.
youre pregnant
I hardly think you need plan b. If you would feel better use it but I doubt you have been exposed to sperm in the way you think.
No
A small amount of alcohol reduces inhibitions, which is why guys or girls who drink will tend to do things they would not normally do when sober. So yeah, if in a social setting you are awkward about sex, a drink or two might make you relax and get it up easier and with more confidence. Just don't overdo the alcohol- as drunk guys tend to not be able to get it up at all, much less can't ejaculate.
Not at all. It often has the opposite effect. What you need to do is work on your anxiety around girls. Otherwise you are setting yourself up for a pattern of never being able to have sex unless you are drunk. Not attractive. And the step on the road to alcoholism. You should also develop a real relationship with a girl before trying to have sex with them. Then you won't be nervous, or you can talk to her about it. So establish emotional, intellectual, and spiritual intimacy before going for physical intimacy. If you can't talk to a girl about your history, then you aren't ready.
a SMALL amount can help you relax but more than a few drinks actually kills an erection.
That won't happen, A Christian has more chance to be killed these days than any other ethnicity that's not the main problem these days.
I think you'll be OK. But Hillary may want to castrate you if you are male. Having testicles is a form of gender inequality and a threat to women's rights.
We are just buying guns in case Hillary gets elected.
Go fcuk yourself, you TROLL!!
Have you not taken him to a doctor? You need to in order to make sure he didn't break his toe or do some kind of damage to the soft tissue that has resulted in a lack of circulation.
It could be broken, bring him to a doctor instead of asking random strangers to diagnose him over the internet. Just a suggestion.
The black discoluration is a big bruise-like thing that will eventually go away
Yes. That's a bruise. It's just blood under the skin, no worries.
His toe may be broken. Get to a doctor.
its probably just bruising but probably a good idea to see a Podiatrist for an XRay
Don't worry. Take a break from it and try again in a week. Then go meet some real people. It's much better. Practice not being done so fast too. Girls don't like that- they'll just be disappointed.
The only harm could come from skin-chaffing. It doesn't hurt your CNS, or your ENS or your ANS.

it won't harm you in any way
Magnesium & Vitamin D are very important in depression. Magnesium deficiency is quite common & stress depletes it. The primary way to get vitamin D is to be in the sun. Vitamin D deficiency is also very common.
don't die know because you don't know what can happen in few days ! miracles happen everyday

Depends on height. Check BMI.
Depends on the height. If they're like 6'10" that might be ok.
If you are 5 feet tall, then it is morbidly obese. If you are 6'3" and athletic, that might be a normal weight.
male ?? female ?? breast size ?? hips, waist, etc size ?? you ask an incomplete question
Seriously overweight, regardless of bone structure.
Overweight for any male under 6'5-6'8, overweight for any girl under 6'9, unless you are very muscular
It doesn't matter. Everyone is beautiful and made differently.
FAT.....
http://themilitarydiet.com/military-diet-plan/ I did this and it worked great. You do have to be discipline, but it's worth the struggle. You can lose up to 10 pounds doing this. For many people it's different. I only lost 3, but my mom lost 5. This is what I go to whenever I want my flat stomach back. If you don't eat something that's on the list then go to the substitution tab and see what foods you can eat as a replacement. If I ever got hungry I would eat a rice cake or a fruit in between each meal.
It's good that you cut out soda. Keep it out of your diet. As for all carbs, that's why you've plateaued. You can cut down on carbs but I'd never recommend cutting them out completely. Eat them before and after workouts to fuel your workout/replenish glycogen. This will allow you to have a more intense workout and burn more calories
try an elimination diet. I stopped using coffee creamer and banana's and lost 15 pounds. Eliminate anything white.
Rice diet check it

Your have nothing to worry about regarding your penis. The average penis is 5 to 6 inches, so your penis at 6 almost 7 inches is perfectly fine and on the big side. It is normal to have veins run through your penis as well.
You have nothing to worry about. You have a nice big penis and everything you described is normal. The guys on porn are freakishly large and do not represent the normal. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some degree.
troll.. is a good word for you .. you really ought to take note that no matter how many times you ask the same question the answer will always be the same. NOTHING other than cosmetic surgery can either enlarge or decrease the size of a penis.. therefor there is absolutely no point in worrying about whether a penis is big or small.
No it is not bad bananas will help you sleep and are loaded with potassium
It's okay and not just because it is a fruit, these things have been studied extensively and it does not matter what time of day you eat, it is how much you eat that matters, you can eat your regular amount of food at any time of the day or night and it makes no difference to weight. The only issue some people have is indigestion if they eat at night and then try to sleep on it but sleeping whilst hungry is equally as difficult so have something if you want it, banana or otherwise.
I find bananas the best thing ever to have late at night.
No. Banana's have melatonin naturally, melatonin helps you sleep.
It is okay to eat any food any time that you feel like it.
Yeah....why wouldn't it be ok? It's healthy for you
just eat it, as long as it's yellow.
No it is perfectly fine. and a great snack.
Nope its a fruit.
Well here's the thing. Our only options are Hillary, Donald trump, and sanders... Out of those three, trump should win. He is not racist. He simply wants to kick people who are not legally US citizens out of the country. That has nothing to do with race. It has to do with law

I'm 17 years old and I can't pull my foreskin back at all. There's just the little hole where the tip is where I can piss from. I've tried to pull it back before but it always hurts, even when I'm not erect. There's a little flab skin that connects the foreskin to my head, kinda like the flab under your tongue. I'm just worried that I won't pull the foreskin down. I don't want to get circumcised. Are they any solutions to this? Thanks!
Some guys cannot retract until 20's. Admittedly a small number. A foreskin is sealed in childhood the seal usually dissolves by itself in puberty. The "little flab" is your frenulum so yes, you should have that. You would need lube for sex but it may be possible. See how it goes. < M
Yes. And if you don't want to get circumcised then you're just going to need to live with it and try and pull it back to clean.
talk to your doctor 'I'm sure they can free up the problem with a small procedure.
Hey. I have had tinntius for over 4 months now. (I'm 17 btw). And i hear buzzing but only when i try to look for it or when its really silent. I would like to know any ways to heal tinnitus (make the noice shade away from time to times). Sense tinntius is there forever. There must be some ways to cool it down? And how do i protect my ears in school without looking like a turd.. (i'm thinking ear puffs etc). Thanks, any advice is good :). Sorry for my bad english btw.
I'm the same as you and I also have tinnitus. Like what Andy C, it don't heal unless form very minor damage. Avoid listening to music with headphones and if you're going to a loud event, make sure you bring ear plugs. As far as school, I guess you could wear headphones just without the music. Which is kinda lame, but you could also put in ear plugs whenever it's loud like in the cafeteria or something like that especially if your hair goes past your ears. So, then it doesn't look too weird
There's nothing to 'cool it down', it either heals or it doesn't. Since tinnitus is caused by nerve damage, it heals when and if the nerves 'heal'. Nerves can only heal from very minor damage. After that, it comes down to replacement. Nerve regeneration takes time. It's been 4 years and it hasn't stopped for me. (Not tinnitus, but polyneuropathy)
Changes to your daily life and surroundings may make it easier to live with tinnitus -- the ringing, hissing, or buzzing sounds in your ears that other people don't hear. ... The symptoms of tinnitus include a noise in the ears, such as ringing, roaring, buzzing, hissing, or whistlin
In the early 1970's I went to the first Rolling Stones Farewell Tour. One of the amps was about 30 yards away from me. Ears have rung ever since. (Concert sucked BTW)
Go to an ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor. If anyone has the answer to this question, she will.

I'd be fine with it. It's not a big surprise for a lot of parents anyway. Most have suspicions that their child is gay, but just don't say anything and let the child open up when they are ready.
I would sit down with my child. And ask what prompted her to feel this way. I would then try to find out what caused her confusion and help her understand why she became confused. I would do this while reassuring her that I love her no matter what she does. Fortunately, I have raised my daughter to understand that pop culture is not normal and things that society tries to justify are not always right.
That would depend on the age of the child: response would be a lot different with a 5 year old than a 15 year old . . . or 50 year old.
Get out of my house.
I would scream the house down.

I've been very sad for a long time now. Recently I've contimplated suicide.. The few I've talked to about what I'm feeling, they all told me to talk to a professional to get help. I don't know how to ask my parents if I could see someone to talk to. I don't want them to waste their money or worry about me. What should I do?
I promise you. Your parents will do anything to help you. No matter how much you think it could be wasting their money. To your parents it's money worth spending.
There are support groups that cost little to nothing that the government will pay for depending on the situation. Pentatonix visited one of them... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKhVGz3d...

This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product product is really a flagship for weight loss. There are not side effects and its really easy to take. I ended up losing 10 pounds in 2 weeks. which is pretty significant. I would recommend this product ot really anybody who wants to lose weight or wants to curb their appetite. The hardest part of this is to remember to take it at least 30 minutes before you eat .
You can lose weight by eating healthily IF you don't consume too many calories. Eating too much of anything, including healthy food, will prevent you from losing weight. To lose weight you have to consume fewer calories than your body needs to maintain its weight. Almost everyone will lose weight on a diet of 1500 calories a day.
yes,eating particular food which you have planned to lose your weight it's a diet.when we are dieting we prefer that types of food which has lots of energy any low calories just like vegetables and fruits.it's a best diet food.by taking proper diet you will observe the changes in yourself.you will become slim and smart as never before
Yes. That is what diet is. Though, the 'healthy' part is open for debate. For example, a conventional healthy diet consists of whole grains and low-fat food (including margarine!). But I (and many others) would consider this to be extremely unhealthy.
Generally an indication of hormonal activity. Puberty Adolescence Menstruation Birth control Pregnancy Lactation Menopause If none of these explain your discomfort, see your doctor

It means it's time to make an appointment to see a doctor.
It could mean "That time of the month"....It could mean A Cyst, it can mean your hormones at work, it could mean pregnancy. It could mean you need to see your doctor.

It may mean manything. you need to check with the doc.
Yes, the average adult penis size is 5 to 6 inches.
The average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some extent.
Depends who you are averaging. About 5.2 inches if you include China and 15 year old Americans. < M
Prolargentsize herbal pill is working for me. My loads are much larger and I'm able to orgasm and be ready to go again. My penis looks bigger.
Average adult erect size is 5.16 inches.
The average ADULT size is 5.1"

A splint is a good idea, as is ice. Keep the finger elevated. If you haven't removed any rings or jewelry from your hand, do so now before swelling starts. If the pain or swelling is limiting the motion or use of your finger or if it goes numb, you need to go to the ER. Also, if there are any lacerations on your finger, any exposed bone, or any crushed tissue, do not delay. Awaken your parents to take you to the emergency room. Disclaimer: Answers are given for educational purposes and are now substitute for the advice of a professional.
First off, you aren't suppose to have an email at 12 years old, secondly most people do, and thirdly, I honestly do not know a solution for your problem
Ice is useless on broken bones and may do more harm than good, bandage it to the finger next to the pinky, it may be uncomfortable but its the only way.
well your parents shouldn't be mad if you broke your finger for waking them up. But if you really think they would be then tape it to the ring finger. That's what they would do at a hospital. seriously tho, you're 12. your parents cant get mad at you for waking them up when you're injured.

so im 14 years old nearly 15 and i am very self conscious about my body. i have size 32b breasts and feel this is very small as my friends are all 32d+. they all say i have small breasts and that makes me a lil anxious.. well very.. also i have a lil extra weight around the botom of my stomach which makes me feel fat. anyone know how i could burn this fat within a short period of time and how i could possible tru to make my brests bigger ? thankyou x
You cannot increase the size of your breasts without surgery or gaining weight. Both of which I wouldn't recommend. You're only 14-years-old. Your breasts may keep growing. Especially if you were a late bloomer. Even if they don't, you will discover that large breasts come with health problems. Bad back, chronic sore neck, bad posture. Plus all the UNWANTED attention that comes with having large breasts. (Men have a tendency to ONLY focus on a girl's breasts when they're large.) Be happy with what you have. 32B is more in line with the average breast size.
Seems to me that the girls you know have super ****. I have not known that many young women in my life who have D cup bras.... most do not. Accept yourself for who you are. Your boobs do not make you as a person.
B is NOT small. those girls your age with D sizes already are going to be sagging to their waists by age 40. exercise burns fat
Yes, you have a very nice penis for your age. Both your length and girth are a lot bigger than average. It is a wonderful size and you should use "Magnum" condoms on your big penis.
I had a small penis . It was 6 inch. I have taken Prolargentsize herbal pill. 1 inch in length and 1.7 inch in thickness so far! will continue to buy. You should give a chance, you may read more in google by writing Prolargentsize
Huge size, girth is big too. Length is not so relevant in condoms as girth, but your girth would need a Magnum for sure.
More than good, be happy
I am sure there is a difference. There are reports that passive smoking is just as bad but I am not sure what carefully those studies were carried out. I would think it would be difficult to get an objective study on the subject.
Smoking is way worse that second hand smoke.
it's nowhere near as bad as actual smoking
All types of smoking are bad for you. They all have the same risks. The more you smoke, the greater the risk.
Better to not smoke at all and if it is hard to go without chew nicotine gum, it really works.
Smoking is still bad either way.
#1, cigs are EXPENSIVE!!!!!!! A total waste of money. #2, you STINK. I hate being around my friend Steve because he literally stinks of cigarettes.

I lost weight incredibly fast by not eating or drinking unhealthy foods, except on saturday. Also, I jump roped for 45 minutes a day and drank a lot of water. Works fairly quickly, and fun with some music in the back.

After almost every operation they encourage you to get up and move as soon as possible - it prevents lung infections. But if you really couldn't brush your own teeth, yes, someone would help you to do that. They certainly wouldn't use tampons - they'd use sanitary pads/napkins. Nurses give patients bed-baths regularly. And yes - some orthodontists do make hospital visits.
Well you're inside a building. Usually in a room with four walls...
They'll give you a bed bath, they'll put a pad or diaper on you not tampons, and your orthodontist will not come in to adjust your braces.
Rarely are you unable to care for those kinds of needs, but yes, they would take care of basic needs. Not likely an orthodontist would come in. Usually, you brush your own teeth, change your own tampon, bathe yourself. I've had four major surgeries and took care of myself afterwards, other than a bedpan or catheter for urine just after.
They'll certainly give you a bed bath, and a bed pan to do the toilet I'm sure they'd also brush your teeth As for a tampon I've really no idea.
You'll have a baby.
If there is some essential thing you can not do there will be someone to help you.
yes they would and they would have someone come in and do all of that
as a 15 year old you are over reacting about Boys. I am as flat as they come and have been married 20 years....it is untrue that men will not love you for it. I am the smallest one in my family Both my mother and sister are Huge. I on the other hand, look like my father. FLAT> I have worn padded bras my whole life to "Keep up with the world" Now I don't give a hoot what they look like. When you become an adult you will realize big boobs are not everything.
No, it doesn't matter a lot, Just take protein and fats rich food, it will help you to get bigger breasts.
You have nothing to worry about, guys like all sorts of sizes. I personally like small to medium and dislike big. There's plenty of people that will like you for you 😊
Yes, guys love big breasts and butt
yes guys like big boobs but thats not all they like. dont worry
I'm guessing you're fat. Make some Lifestyle Changes bro. Start eating healthier foods and cut out the junk. Start exercising and working out everyday.
Exercise more, it'll burn you body fat.
I'm only 16, and I'm joining the gym, I'm very excited to get started! I'm going to be going first thing in the morning so is it better to eat first or after? Also I might end up going in the evening instead so that way would I eat dinner before or after? Is there a time to wait after eating? Any information would be appreciated, thanks :)
If you eat to close to the exercise classes then you'll get a stitch and it'll b horrid (lol trust me) but you'll need the energy to do the exercise in the first place! I would wake up and eat breakfast instantly, giving it long enough to digest a bit, and get ready after and then go.
If you eat before make sure it's at least 1 hour before. It's a preference as to whether or not to exercise on an empty stomach. Some people prefer at least a small snack, and if you eat just a little, you don't have to wait an hour before you workout. I prefer to eat after I workout. I used to get up early and workout then not eat breakfast until I got to work later. In the evenings when I workout, I do it when I get home from work, and then have supper afterward. That's just my preference. There is no specific better way.
My parents just found out about my cutting addiction. I used a sharpener blade to cut my wrist and thighs. They are putting me into counselling now, which I have been dreading. So that is why I am asking this question. Maybe if I knew what to expect, then I may not be as nervous. I've been doing it for about 6 months. If you need any more information then I would be happy to give it to you. Thanks in advance! :)
What you can expect is to learn why you are cutting, how to stop cutting, how to deal with the emotions that you are burying by cutting. You will be able to talk freely to the counselor and work things out. So you just talk. They may feel it necessary, for your safety, to put you in a hospital. But that's usually just for a few days if you can't stop. Wouldn't you rather have a life without cutting? It can get so much better.
Self harm is a symptom of depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. Ask a dr. if you could have low dose Zoloft. After your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel so much better.--- Then find big happy churches, attend age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Its also the best way to meet good people. And talk with the pastor/minister; where else can you get counseling for free? -- Remember God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
Talk therapy is great - don't be scared. They will probably just ask you questions and you need to answer them truthfully. You will really like having someone listen to you openly who only wants to help you.

( Weight Loss Green Store Tea product ) is a wonderful product. I was watching what I eat (Low carbs) and exercising at least 3 times a week but hit a sticking point at 10 pounds down so I decided to try this product....two weeks later I am 16 pounds down!I works fantastic. It taste good and I use it only once a day, it cleans your system out that is for sure.
Yes it has. Mentally, I feel a lot better in my clothes, Physically, I feel more energized, Emotionally, I am happy to be able to walk out of the store with some clothes. And it's nice that they fit loser!
feel better generally, more energy
No I don't think it's possible to get high off such a small dose especially soon as it was mixed with the air around you too I know second hand smoke can be scary but please don't worry so long as you didn't start to go dizzy, see hallucinations or get drowsy you didn't inhale enough to get high it's ok
youre joking right.... no. not at all. you could inhale as much as you wanted by following him around all day and youd never feel anything.
Did you want to?
no

You cannot smoke anything of any kind until you're all healed up. I had to learn that the hard way when I got my wisdom teeth removed. They told me not to smoke, and I got something called "dry socket" and trust me, it's a whole lot less pleasant than it sounds already. Lay off the dope for a while.
Yeah just wait a few hours to make sure it won't get infected but sure you'll be fine my boyfriend got 2 and as long as he took his antibacterial pills and the ones for pain he's been fine

wait atleast 12 hours than you should be fine

This has been happening ever since last month, I'm not exactly sure what caused me to think about death, probably my anxiety or my friend that passed away recently, but I keep thinking about what will happen if I die, or how I'll die and what will happen to my family & friends, whats worse is that I have severe hypochondria. I got really curious one day and looked up death on the internet and saw a documentary and several videos about death and saw people's coffins being dug up and opened and I thought about me in that coffin, then I got traumatized all weekend and my thought of death was even stronger. I'm 17 btw.
Sounds like me at 17 honestly. I was afraid of death so bad I refused to live. I mean think about that for a dang minute. There are two things certain in life and that's death and taxes. I know nothing said here will fix how you feel but live your life man. You could die today inside on the computer or in 82 years playing lawn darts. You have to accept that it's real and just live everyday to the maximum. P.S- Tell everyone you love exactly that....everyday
Loss of a loved one often triggers thoughts of our own mortality. And eventually, death will come to us all. Worrying about it in the meantime is a fool's errand. Why waste your time worrying about that? Perhaps some therapy would help. You must be a very anxious person to also have hypochondria. What a horrible waste of your life.
You are letting your hypochondria get the best of you. Perhaps you should ask yourself this question. "What if I live to be 100 years old with nothing more than a cold or flu? Where would all this senseless worrying get me" (Nowhere) You are simply having anxiety due to your friend. Nothing more. Stop looking crap up online....
I would like to have a big penis . I ordered Prolargentsize “herbal” capsule which make my penis bigger and increasing my penis size. It has no side effects. My blood circulation is perfect. My performance is perfect.
About an inch above adult average so good to go.
What does your mom say about it when she changes your diaper?
good for what?
She needs a hobby to keep her hands busy. Knitting is very calming and snooting to the nerves and she can create some things she will be proud of.
Nervousness?
She is just forking with you.
Ask her.

You would be best to make sure your issues are under control via medication and/or therapy before even considering to have children. Yes in your state, you would definitely pose a threat to them.
Get yourself under control first. See a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
I am up in the air on this; if you are aware of these short comings you can adjust and compensate, if you can't adjust and compensate, that is another matter. 90% of a problem is failure to recognize there is a problem.
Yes no kids
Jeez, have like an online family like Farmville or something, not a real one. Sorry.
Yes,i am sure.
I would like to lose some wieght. I am a 13 year old girl and I am 185lbs . I and not a healthy person I don't like fruits and most vegetables also I am not an active person I am trying to get out of the habit of not being active. P.s. I am 5ft 4inches (I am transferring school and would like to take the stress off my shoulders of being over weight)
You don't necessarily need to eat fruits and vegetables in order to lose weight, just try to limit your calories. I find that using a Fitbit or an app like MyFitnessPal motivates you and allows you to keep on track with a diet. If you are willing to pay money I would maybe schedule an appointment with a nutritionist or join classes like yoga (if you're looking for something not too active) or a sport, or a gym
You have to eat less. There is no magic solution, no matter what anyone says. When yo start dieting, you start a lifetime of gaining weight. People who diet are FAT. Diets made them that way. Don't become one of them. You weigh a lot for your height. Stop snacking and cut down your portions. Don't drink sugary drinks. Just drink water. That will take out hundreds of calories a day, right there.
I love this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea product. I've tried many things before and the only thing they did was make me grumpy and have a lot of side affects. This though, I have no cravings for junk food, I've been using it for a week and already lost 5 pounds on top of gaining a lot of energy!
Exercise
you don't have to eat healthy but even just a 5 minute workout would do it I did a 5 minute workout everyday and ate less lost 10 pounds in a week
Drink green tea
I think it's important to get evaluated by a couple doctors and make sure that you're healthy in terms of hormonal balances and from there if you are i would suggest trying a change in diet and life style before you take drugs, I too used to suffer from anxiety and when I took the drugs the gave me it made me have more anxiety. Do realize I am not a doctor and if you're in a bad place and your doctor thinks you should takes meds it may react different and actually work for you.
Heroin, pain pills, alchol or xanax. The only thing that cures anxiety is doing the things your most scared of. You fear talking to women, you talk to 30 women a day. Your scared of what others think of you, you where crocks and a top hat where ever you go. Trust me the only way out is through the scariest place in your mind.
psychotherapy helping get rid of what causes the anxiety Anti anxiety meds that numb it
Tell a dr. how you feel; there are good meds or anxiety.
Why should they be treated any differently from any other medical test or procedure? The issue is bigger than just mammograms. We need a sane single-payer health care system in the USA like all other first-world countries have. I'm a male breast-cancer survivor who has to have an annual mammogram, but I don't see why that one specific medical test should be singled out for a 100% subsidy. Lots of other people need lots of other kinds of medical treatment just as much as I need the mammogram.
Some Mammogram Mobiles come around and offer free mammograms. Google "Free Mammograms, In "Your Town" see what comes up.
I agree, let me just spend a few hundred thousand dollars of my own money for the machine and pay a doctor his salary to operate the machine and read the results for you. Maybe I can pick you up and drive you to the appointment with my car while I'm at it.
nothing is free. They could be covered by a decent health care system though. The money still has to come from somewhere though, if it isn't coming from the patient.
Your doctor has 7-10 years of schooling and $400,000 worth of student loans to pay off. But I am sure he wants to give his services away for free.
they ARE free in the united states or at least in my state to women who have low income and no health insurance, as part of "the women's cancer screening program" so are pap smears. all you have to do is call them.
They are here.
I once forgot to make an order for someone who asked me if I can also order clothes for her like I was ordering for myself. The woman was so upset and at some point for an unknown reason to me, she kept insisting that I have cancer...and I said...I don't, and she kept insisting again....and I kept insisting that I don't...and I said....why are you saying this...because i haven't ordered you clothing...and she said yes... The woman is almonst 40 years old...and she should be more mature at her age...(I am 25) Oh...and recently she kept insisting that I am divorced....I have never been married.... For some reason this keeps obsessing me now...and cancer...honestly....
This woman sounds both horrible and mentally unwell. If I were you, I would distance myself from her. Even if you intended to do her this favor and neglected to follow through, the bad she is wishing upon you is completely out of proportion to the "wrong" she feels you did her. Let her order her own damned clothes.
Well don't worry about it. What comes around goes around, her wish of cancer on you will come back to bite her in the A**...don't; worry. Honestly, she's just Weird.
Sounds like she may have a few mental health issues.

like someone else on here said for get what other people thing abou you....and you dont need a boyfrind thats just ridiculus...they arent helpful saying "icant live anymore being ugly,someone give me advice now!?" is pathetic get over it if people dont like you for you, that doesnt give you a reason to overdose. And also not everyone is going to like you, sorry but its true. my advice is get over it and live your life
Everyone is beautiful to someone. That someone is out there waiting for you. Many lovely 16 year olds think the are ugly! Just widen your circle of friends, blue eyes, and one of them will click Promise!.
Love yourself first so others will love to nobody's gonna tell that you're beautiful until you know that yourself.. I'm sure that YOU'RE beautiful inside out don't even compare yourself to others YOU'RE just pretty the way you are.. Love yourself gurrrllll
You have to get over it, and start living the live you wanted, it was hard for me to accept it, but working hard for future goals help me stop thinking about, you shouldnt waste valuable time of your life thinking about this, accept it, get over it and move on
Makeup.
No it doesnt, it can mean there is a posibility of having pre cancer in the future but it can also be from the time of the month it was tested. Mydaughters test came back with abnormal cells and was advised to get checked again in 3 months, the test came back clear - seemingly if periods have just finished it can show abnormal cells, Good Luck
If it happens to be pre cancer, the Dr. can very easily take care of it. I have had several pre cancer places taken off with absolutely no problems. Do not worry about it and let the Dr. do his job.
It means you need to follow up and find out.
I don't think worrying will help.
Any sudden increase, or even perceived increase in floaters should be looked at by an ophthalmologist. Don't hold your breath for a cure, but who really knows what tomorrow will bring.
Floaters usually come from the WET form of macular degeneration, which can get very nasty & blind you. Best if you 'see' an ophthalmologist & get an exam. Macular is hereditary - How are your parents eyes ?? One of the reasons to be checked is that they can take pictures of your retina now, then compare to later pictures & see if there have been any changes. I have bad wet macular & have had surgery on both eyes for detached retinas. That possible problem could have been treated sooner IF they had had older pictures of the retina already on hand.
They have a cure for that by using a laser light.
GO and get an eye test you need to get your eyes checked out properly
You cannot lose weight "efficiently" because you are already underweight and need to gain about 30 pounds.
Absolutely enjoy weight loss gren store tea! I have noticed a significant change in my stomach - wheremost of my fat is stored. It is shrinking by the month! I will most definitely continue using this product!
Considering you gained 11 pounds in 8 months, its most likely that you are growing, whether it be your muscles or your bones, so in that case, i see no way nor reason to lose that weight.
Stds are not created from thin air, some one has to have an std in order to pass it onto you. If both partners are not infected by an std they're not going to get any thing from each other.
no, someone has to be/get infected from someone else to pass it on, you can't just develop an STD.
no you can't as one of them would have to have one
Nah The fairies give you the fûcker in the night.
Because There's an age-old saying in medicine : 'The eyes are the window to the kidneys' . There is a recognised connection between a person's eye health and their kidney health. There are several conditions that can affect both your eyes and your kidneys ; as well as there being several other conditions that cause damage to your kidneys, but can be most easily recognised by the damage done to your eyes. Possibly the doc. was asking about your kidney health so he/she could decide whether or not the problem really was with your eyes...or might the root cause of your eye problem be found in your kidneys.
Depends on why you had them looked at in the first place. They may have asked that because the whites of your eyes appeared unusual.
Straining while going to the bathroom can increase blood pressure and cause small vessels to break.
Because sometimes too much straining when going to the bathroom can cause broken blood vessels, and more damage to the eye.
It appears that you did not ask this question to the person you should have: the doctor.
If your ankle is fractured, then you need to go to the doctor even though you don't have any money or insurance. You need to make sure your ankle heals right or you may be in pain and not walking right for the rest of your life.
How do you know that it's fractured without seeing a doctor and having an X-ray done unless you can move it in some extremely unnatural positions. You could show them how you can bend your foot sideways and all of the swelling and bruising.
If you really have a broken ankle go to the ER and you will be treated there without charge. And they will give you an excuse.
if it's fractured, it should be in a cast and how are you going to work without it being in a cast?
Wrap-it-up TIGHTLY & wear tight lace-up boots. But don't expect your ankle to like it.
The emergency room will take you without insurance and money. Go get help now.
Go to the doctors
Contact the place that did the X-ray that diagnosed the break and send it to your employer.

I've seen people with more just acne,and they seem to get along famously with their partners.These spots disappear after a few weeks or months,depending on the environment and climate.It would have been better if you uploaded a picture of the spots.Who knows,you might have got hives on your skin.
Yeh mate you are pretty screwed, You should have used some clearacel or something? If you wanna try you could like put like your mom's make up on but she is gonna know anyway. BTW If you don't mind since she will be single soon would you mind giving me her number mate? Thanks man much appreciated.
If she truly loves you, your acne marks won't matter to her (:
If she actually loves you, then little imperfections will not matter to her :) Good luck!
of course if shes a real person
If she truly loves you, then yes.
Nope. Dont use finger nail polish to make your teeth brighter. You could damage the Tooth enamel.
You mean putting nail polish on teeth? No, that will probably be harmful if swallowed. Use storebought teeth whitener or something.
Do not put white nail polish on your teeth. It is not for your consumption and should not be placed in your mouth. Would you drink nail polish? No. Do not put it in your mouth
NO>>>>>Do not Paint your teeth with nail polish!
No. You could damage the tooth enamel.
Most males quit growing from 15-18 so certainly normal to finish by 16 if that is what your genetics have programmed for you.
Prednisolone steroids are not the kind that have an effect on puberty or growth. They are corticosteroids, which shouldn't impact your growth at all.
That's when men stop growing taller.
i would still see a doctor and i doubt you have stopped growing
Your penis is not small at all. Being 7 inches is a lot bigger than average and almost perfect in size.
You have been looking at too many porno videos of black porno actors with monster 10 inch cocks- chosen from a very small % of the male population . A penis of your size is above the national average of 5.5 inch and is perfectly adequate for sex if fact most females/gay guys wouldn't let a 10 inch penis anywhere near their vagina /anus.
Not at all. And black guys aren't that much bigger than white guys on average. Average size for all races is 5.16 inches, and average girth is 4.59 inches so you are huge like a mule, dude, be proud.
Used these Prolargentsize as directed and in just 2 weeks both me and my girlfriends noticed increase of length and width next time. I will definitely purchase 2 to 3 bottles instead of just one. very amazing product flawless.
Well yeah, it depends whether this "black" bit means ethnic Kalahari bushman or Nubian warrior, dunnit. I think 7 x 5.4 inches will service most girls whatever ethnic roots. < M
t's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
No your not small. YOu have a nice big dick.
hmm
it's way good. enjoy
I had orthopedic surgery to my upper limb two weeks ago. Day surgery. Family is not helping with basic needs. They are not interested. I don't expect a lot but need help with basic things. I ended up going to my own place and trying my best to help myself. My sleep and appetite is not great. I feel haggard. Should I tell the surgeon I'm not sleeping well and my appetite is not good due to stress etc?
Unless you're not sleeping/eating because of pain, etc, then there's prolly little your surgeon can do. Where are you? In the UK you should let your GP surgery know as they are the people who can arrange for some (free) help for you from district nurses, carers, etc. Somewhere like the US, you're probably on your own (unfortunately).
In the hospital, the surgeon or the nurse. At home, it depends on why and the kind of surgery. So if you are not sleeping or eating because of pain or the effects of the surgery, then yes. Otherwise, probably not.
Yes you should.
Ibrance is a treatment used for late stage cancers and extends life, it does not cure breast cancer. Maybe, if given as a primary treatment method earlier in treatment, it could cause remission, but that is an open question left for future study. Right now, the treatment has the promise of extending a woman's life for several months. It is not a cure.
Many cancer drugs send cancer into remission for some people. Some cancer drugs just hold it at bay and prevent it from spreading as quickly. Ibrance is intended to treat metastatic breast cancer - meaning cancer that has already spread. You really need to talk to your cancer doctor to know what the goals are for using it in your treatment. Read about it here. http://labeling.pfizer.com/ShowLabeling....
At the moment it has only proven useful against specific hormone reactive breast cancers in post menopausal women. Most cancers do not react to these hormones so this is unlikely to be of any use against them. For those it is of benefit for, it could be a huge breakthrough.
Not in all cases, every one reacts to the drug differently, so its 50/50
There is no way- no muscles in the penis, nothing to exercise. Just a tissue-filled loose organ that gets hard when filled with blood.
The usual form of exercise at 20 is called sex. < M
100 penis pushups
there is no exercise that could do what you ask.
You may do, my b/f did. It is your lucky day... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
There is none.
I only scored myself (or however you say it) with scissors and I got a scar. Don't do it.
Serious Issues.
Don't
Use a scissor blade.
Is there a question?
Three things to consider. Expense - can she afford the same level of care if she moves? Many patient continue to work throughout treatment. Health - will there be more positive than negative health impacts if she moves? Some patient are too ill to move comfortably. Her wishes - many cancer patients prefer to live a life as close to normal as possible during treatment. Does she want to move? What has stopped her from moving before? Has that changed? Some patients crave the familiar and would hate moving.
Yes, it is within your rights to seek transfer of your beloved mom to California.
Hopefully she isn't getting chemo, there's better treatments out there than that.
if her insurance is good in that state, yes. but whether she has insurance or not, she can go where ever she wants to be treated. that's just up to her personally.
depends on her insurance
That was really the first time you ever glanced at the sun in your life ? You simply dazzled the photo receptors in your eyes. They will be back to normal very soon. Nothing to worry about. It will happen many times again in your lifetime. Your dog is very classy btw, it uses a restroom. I'm impressed.
Hopefully this is only temporary but you should NEVER look at, or towards the sun. It could damage your eye permanently. If this doesn't improve, you must see your optician.
It should fade away soon. If its still there in a few days, see your eye doc.
Nothing is wrong. this is very common from looking at the sun.
As long as you don't physically hold in the semen (not sperm- sperm is just a tiny component of semen) that is Ok to "hold back". But if you are clamping down on your penis and preventing an ejaculation, that can cause internal damage.
Yes it is. In time you will learn to control your orgasm making you better at sex.
It should not have any negative effect.
why i like to hurry and let it go
If you are not comfortable and functional then you need to be at your doctor having your meds adjusted . A good doctor will see you and adjust your meds frequently . If your doc is not doing this ,,, well then , you need a new one . It's your responsibility to tell your doctor what complaints and problems you are having . My limited experience with dating bipolar chicks ,,,,,, being in a relationship with someone with bipolar feels like being bipolar yourself . While I won't say ' You ' should not marry ,,,,,,, but I would not date or marry a bipolar chick again .
Men usually stop growing at 18-21. Add your parents heights together,divide by 2 then add five inches(13cm). That should be the height you grow to, give or take a couple of inches
No. You've stopped. You won't grow 2 inches.
None of us can possibly know if you are done growing or not. Think about your question... We know nothing about you.
Maybe. You will have to wait and see.
Now i'm really confused, are you fluffy stirring up Yoshi or are the two of you the same person..... this is all too much for my head da da da da

So several weeks ago, I woke up in my bed to find my pillow gone. I walked upstairs (my room is in the basement) to find it perfectly placed on the chair in the kitchen. I thought this was weird, but ignored it. Last night, I woke up and found a pillow I keep on my desk had suddenly ended up in my bed with me. Is there something involved with moving pillows in my sleep? I have had similar incidents in the past several months that include my door randomly being open and my girlfriend waking up to the light being on in my room, but before that everything was minimal. I am 18 years old. Thanks,
sounds to me like your sleep walking
Ure sleep walking...
thats odd. I dont do
Yeah. My mom's depressed and we need our own home. I'd do anything to get that money to see her smile again
What is good but is hard to find these days is pork brains. You used to be able to get them fresh from a butcher shop or buy them in a small can in the grocery store. Dice a teaspoon full and put it in a skillet with a little oil or butter to saute until browned then scramble two eggs and add that to the skillet. A dash of salt before serving and you have a breakfast fit for a king, that is until you discover that teaspoon of pork brains contains 1200 mg of cholesterol
Not only would i eat it, i would sprinkle some pepper and lemon on that sh, that would be the best meal of my life. A million dollars could change my entire life. no pigeon brain coming in the way of me and my million dollars. Amen
If I was hungry enough I would pay to eat pigeon brains, and so would you to save yourself from starving to death. So to answer your question yes I would eat them for a million $$$
Pigeon brains are edible so yes. I would eat any part of any animal for a million as long as it was safe because it's organic material.
Sure.... I like brains. with mushrooms, simmered in white wine. Yum. I'm having goats brains tomorrow. I have had calves brains, lamb brains, goat brains.... I'd be willing to try pigeon brains... probably much the same, just smaller. The have a pretty strong smell to them but you just soak them in milk for a few hours before you cook them..... I don't have a problem with eating animals but I do have a problem discarding pieces of said animal.
I'd rather walk in cow manure barefoot. Certain things I'd rather not eat. Of course a pigeon's brain isn't so voluminous. Maybe I could. Can we cook it first??
Yes
There's a saying that goes like this: "Pigeons are rats of the sky". So no. Definitely not.
Please be aware that not everyone in the world eats the same things. Pigeon, including brains, would not be considered an unusual meal in many places
Kill yourself. You'll eventually decompose enough for him to crawl out somewhere.

No real way to increase it once your development is done- most guys have their adult size girth by 16.
https://okaydick.com/penis-enlargement-exercises/girth combine the Wet Jelq, with the Double Erect Squeeze. I think it's working for me, but don't over do it. Have your rest days
If you are still young, you wait on nature to run its course. If you are 15 or 16 years old or older, then your penis is not going to grow anymore.
I've heard having foreskin can make your penis slightly thicker. Are you circumcised?
Sorry you can't no more change that than make your skull larger.
Cant
That's quite a bit to carry and doesn't bode well as weight accumulates. It won't decrease without effort. To be more accurate, I'd check BMI and do a survey in a geographical area considered the heaviest and one for the opposite. At 67", I'd weigh, 135 lbs tops.
hard to tell because we don't know your body fat percentage. You may be the rock for all I know. He probably weights a crap ton but he isn't "fat". Although if you do a bmi of your height and weight you are a bit "overweight". But like I said that doesn't really tell me anything.
The target weight for someone who is 5'7" is 140lbs (+/- 10lbs) for a woman and 150lbs (+/- 10lbs) for a man. Basic math tells me you're around 35lbs overweight, which would suggest you likely have a bit of a belly, flabby arms and moobs...
i 'm 5'9 193 and I have a decent gut so you are fat my friend
that's about me almost exactly - it depends on how the weight is distributed - most of my extra weight is on my torso - legs and arms are skinny
I showed up at my son s (9) orthodontist appointment today to see the med assistant telling parents they can no longer go in appointments with their kids due to HIPPA. The appointments are in a communal area, but this is a new policy and my son is mid "Phase 1" (braces) treatment. I m also his legal guardian (as are all the other parents sitting in the waiting room with me. No one was able to answer questions either. Everyone seemed on edge. This can t be right. Is it legal to tell parents they can t go to appointments with their kids?
I've actually always wondered why my parents couldn't go back with me at the orthodontist. When my brother got braces they could go back with him but that was years ago. I've had my braces for over a year and maybe 2 appointments my parents could go back with me. The orthodontist always tells my parents what's happening after each appointment. Nothing wrong is going to happen back there though. It might be because of space. But I'm not sure. Maybe you could ask the orthodontist and see.
Something isn't right there... As a kid I would have refused to go in to the dentist without one of my parents. I was the same way when I was 18! I'm now 19 and went to the dentist today to have fillings and she was surprised that my mum didn't go with me. If I were you, I'd find a new orthodontist.
You need to get a new dentist asap!! This is a disaster waiting to happen. All over the news you hear about dentists abusing there patients(children) by pulling to manny teeth and chocking. Talk about childhood nightmares coming true. I don't know if there's a legal issue, because I did a little research and few layers would take on a cause about abuse from dentists. Talk to your child about what happened in the room. Any problem available to a parent is avalanche to a child Please check on the link below but copy and pasting http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html
As a Nurse Epidemiologist, I know that there is no way I would ever ask this of my patients and no way I'd tell parents of a minor to stay away. You can call your state health dept. and report them or you can talk to the doctor directly, no assistant nor office person.
If he's nine no reason he can't sit in a dental chair alone. You can wait in the waiting room. They don't need nosey parents in there.
Its nonsense especially if your child is anxious. COMPLAIN.
You're 41 and you like a girl in her 20s. She might be interested. I'd suggest asking her out to lunch if you're not sure - it's less expensive than dinner, and if it turns out she's not into you, it won't be as awkward when you ask her. Also, take time to talk with her, get to know her - and her you, maybe you have some similar interests. I mean, if it's meant to be...
That's a broad spread in age. It won't matter now, but it will in your later years. Still, I've known couples that managed that age difference. If the emotional match is good, then love conquers all.
Addition: I'd have more in common with the ones I look, more so than the ones my chronological age...just really out of sync causing issues. Heck, wasn't until mid latter 20's when interest in girls spiked.
Women are less concerned about the sort of age gap you're discussing and more concerned about the man's sense of self, his image in his own mind, his self-esteem. Mature and intelligent women don't care for arrogant braggarts, but they also tend to not like men lacking in normal confidence...which you seem to be lacking in. Work on your confidence and you'll stop worrying about your age.
Hi it is about so much more than looks sunshine chemical attraction is what fires women up not anything else.
Depends how rich he is. LOL. How do we know = ask her. < M
Try and see...
Ok I don't know if this is much help but I hope you know you aren't alone. I'm 13 and do the same thing. I pretend my life is a tv show and I make up characters. I talk to myself a lot. I constantly think I'm going crazy. I think I do it because I don't have many friends but I believe it's harmless. If your really worried maybe talk to a councillor or therapist. It may be hard to open up but it might help
You aren't mental, you seem more like a dreamer.
Could you have a flair for the arts? Take Drama and all this will feel normal to you if that is indeed the case.
You probably will have to see how you feel after you get the filling. Then you can decide if you feel up to going to school. I'm sure you will be able to speak and swallow it just may feel weird for a little while. No reason to be scared, everyone gets fillings :) good luck!!!
Numbness varies. Some people walk out of the dental office without any problems speaking while some people walk out feeling numb and have small troubles talking. Thankfully this should only last for about 30-60 minutes.
The numbing wears off in a couple of hours. You might talk a little funny until then, and water might dribble out of the corner of your mouth a little. No reason not to go back to school the same day, though.
You should be fine, it just might be weird to smile! :) just see how you feel as well, be side last time I had a filling my mouth was fine but after a few hours it became very sore. Hope I helped!
Sure, just make certain your dentist writes you a prescription for some Demerol, so that when the local anesthetic wears off, you won't be in pain.
I think your good unless you get some kind of infection which probably won't happen. Good luck!:)
U should can. it doesnt last too long, 1 hour at the most.
probably not its painful I know but you should wait till you get better.
No
No, you were probably peeing.
i doubt that very much unless you have an abnormal prostrate gland.. the normal amount of seminal fluid that ejaculated is a teaspoon worth.
Sorry to burst your bubble but you didn't.

If you're a horse it is.
Well that does seem like a lot.
thats rare, might be a record

Don't supplement unless prescribed because the body stores iron. Please get your blood checked. You'll want to know if you are anemic and rule out anything else
Were the iron tablets prescribed or did you self diagnose? Have you had your levels checked by your doctor? If you haven't seen and been tested by your doctor, I suggest you do so as there could be another underlying condition.
Iron pills do not make you stop craving red meat & you can be tired from any number of things.
Are you eating enough and get enough sleep?
Without know what your symptoms are it is hard to give you a good answer. If you have had some menstrual problems, like spotting or bleeding more it could be fibroids or a cyst on your ovary. I had a hysterectomy because of large fibroids and later I had my ovaries removed because of cysts that were over 5 cm. Symptoms of ovarian cyst and ovarian cancer can be very similar so be patient and wait to see how your tests come out.
Has your doctor given you any indication what they are looking for? Fibroids? Cancer? Cysts? Endometriosis? The symptoms of ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer are very similar.
I hope that all goes well for you and that if it's anything at all, like you said, that it's only fibroids.
You should be asking this question to a doctor
Not exactly. And u never know it could be something else.
I have an elevated heart rate all the time at the moment (100-160bpm on a day to day basis) and I have been having episodes where I almost pass out and my heart rate goes up as high as 210. I got rushed into ER 2 weeks ago with one of these episodes that came on after I d experienced left jaw pain radiating into my left shoulder and a pressure on my chest. The hospital took a d-dimer blood test and after about 5 hours sent me home. I recently found out that my d-dimer was raised - I am a 26 year old female. What does this mean?
I did ask my doctor - she rang me today and said that if the hospital sent me home they mustn't have been worried. Shes a new GP though and doesn't know my history -I'm at the GP tomorrow to go over it further but i was wondering in the meantime what it meant.
Ask your physician

**** I'm a black guy I'm 9in so don't have to worry about that but just work with what you have Bro better tell the girl before sex look my dick is small *** **** but I can make it work and if she says uhuh no then my brother you have no sex life better start using that tounge 😂 If that doesn't work you should just turn gay lmao just saying
Rub it. Maybe a magical genie will pop out and then you can ask him for a bigger d*ck.
Grab a hold of it with both hands and pull really hard. It's going to hurt, but it will work.
Consult Ron Jeremy. He is an expert concerning big d*cks.
By losing weight.
It's probably NOT small. If you push back on your pubic area (the skin) you probably will realize it's not as small as you think.
Genetics, you're screwed. You should turn gay or use that tounge like that other dude said...
you could join a gym and try to lose a few pounds
There's nothing anyone can do - What you have is what you have.
If he is keeping you up ask him to shut up so you can sleep. If he has been masturbating with you in the room for a while and you are just now raising that as an issue, he'l probably ignore that.
That's going to be an awkward conversation.

In the Summer, if you don't wear tights, shorts, leggings etc to stop skin on skin, you get a very painful heat rash - chub rub!
You don't have to be fat for that to happen. Anyone with a healthy amount of muscle has their thighs touching when they walk. How does it feel that you can't lift anything heavy? Or that your more likely to need a hip surgery when your 70?
There are under garments that prevent skin to skin contact.
Hi... maybe you have allergies? Did you ever try taking allergy medication? I have had horrendous allergies starting every spring through fall and i have to take something every day or i can't breathe and i go through a ton of kleenex. Or you could have some sort of sinus problem. Did you tell your doctor about the stuffiness and did he do anything about it? If not, get an opinion from another doctor.
I somehow doubt that nose drops would cause neurotic anxiety. I'd wager you are dealing with an unconscious conflict. It's probably also causing your stuffed up nose.
im sorry you're sad, but whatever the reason, even if there is no reason, you are wonderful and deserve to be happy! don't let yourself down any further. go watch some funny videos on youtube, do something you like :) i hope you start to feel better soon <3
Get happy ferrel knows how it's done find a room without a roof I hear that helps?
you should listen to a trump speech. you will feel glad and the next thing you know is you will be voting for trump. a common sense politician finally in what is in forever! we havent had one of those people since reagan.
So? Why should anyone try to make you less sad when you are obviously just another needy attention wh0re. We have plenty of those already.
Stop being a Liberal

You have a risk of contracting an STI whenever you have unprotected sex. It doesn't matter if she's had 2 partners or 202. Of course, the more partners you've had, the more increased your chances are. You could have had hundreds of partners and they all may be clean. Or you could have had just one, but that one has an STI. Given your symptoms you should definitely see a doctor. And next time, always use protection! It's always a good idea to get tested for STI's with any new sexual partner.
Aids
Could you be at risk? Yes. Should you get tested? Yes.
I want to **** goblins sister
Netflix and remember that you are awesome.
I want you to make a sign big enough that you can see it across your room on the wall... "Not my choice today" Meaning you are never again going to choose to be bored to the point of depression. Go do some volunteering around your neighborhood by cleaning, mowing, etc. Old people will love you for it... will everyone will at any age.
Yes
Find something fun to do and get your mind off the boredom
engage in different hobbies or get a pet and nurture the pet.
Not sure if it was a placebo effect or the pills themselves, but I noticed a tremendous difference. My erections were easier to attain and keep hard, and were a lot stronger in general. I perpetually leaked pre-***. I left a trail of it in my wake like some sort of crazy **** slug. My stamina and control greatly improved. I could go for as long as I wanted and climax basically when I felt like it, and my loads were thick and bountiful. I highly recommend giving these Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pills a shot. They worked wonders for me.
LOL.... not at your age. Erectile dysfunction in a teen is virtually unheard of. ED is the inability to get or maintain an erection.
I was a bit skeptical about buying this because I feel like some of these just don't get the job done but I wanted to please my lady more and boy oh boy this did the job as said. I love this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product and would definitely recommend to other people needing a little boost.
than see a doctor
That's a question 🙋 for the doctor 😷 but In the meantime I'd suggest you compete the full 🌕 course of antibiotics unless you're having an severe adverse reaction symptoms to the antibiotics in which case id recommend you go back 🔙 to the doctor 😷
It's possible that the other ear isn't infected. It could be impacted ear wax. If it didn't clear up after you finish the antibiotics, then visit your doctor.
yes don't stop antobiotics just becsjyse its better
What about going to a doctor fool.
you shouldn't take any vaccinations for it in the near future, we vaccinated my grandson and he recently got diagnosed with autism.
keep taking the anti-biotics until they are all gone...
I'm a 17 year old girl, I weigh 130 lbs and I'm 5'4. Whenever I exercise, whether it be running, squats, lunges I run out of breath super fast. I could do 5 squats and I'm already out of breath. Today, in P.E. we had to run 4 laps in under 10 minutes and I couldn't do it. I ran out of breath after the first lap. Everyone was else was able to finish under 10 minutes except me. My time was like 12:05 and it was so embarrassing because I was the last one to get done. Is there something wrong with my lungs? Do I need to go see a doctor? Please help.
If you are a smoker, you don't have healthy lungs. Now if you are a healthy person, than you are maybe out of shape. What you need to do is keep on running which will help you become a good runner. Remember to do breathing practice, breath in and out before you exercise. It takes time to get better.
You may not be breathing well. Look up yoga deep breathing for instruction. You actually have to extend your abdomen to give room for your diaphram to move down to pull in a full breath. Also, make sure you're not holding your breath as a result of nervousness. Keep breathing through the activity. Also, there is such a thing as catching your second wind. If you keep pushing yourself, you may eventually get that second wind and catch your breath.
I called today to make an appointment to remove my brackets and the receptionist explained that the time it would take to make a retainer depends on the weather in part, if its humid it'll take longer. Anyone know anything about this? Do they make retainers outside or what, this is weird. I'll def ask the dr when I see him. I couldn't find anything on google either.
I would be curious to know their explanation for that comment as well. I've made retainers for over 20 years. I can't imagine how the weather would ever be a factor, unless there was a blizzard and they couldn't make it to the office.
Weather shouldnt effect making a retainer. They make retainers inside the office. I would ask your orthodonist your question.
It takes longer for the mold to set in your mouth.
No, neither is being pro choice. But if you're going to be pro life, that means you think abortion is wrong under ANY circumstance, including rape. A lot of times people will say "I'm pro life! Unless a 16 year old was raped, that's the only time it's okay to get an abortion." But that's hypocrisy at its best. A "baby" is a "baby" no matter how it was conceived.
Pro choice is bad Anyone who disagrees if free to disagree but they're baby killers Pro choice people just say and make up crap so they don't feel bad for taking away a life They have no appreciation for life It's sad
If you were just being a dumbass and got pregnant, you shouldn't be able to have an abortion. If someone was raped, they shouldn't have to go through 9 months plus some because of what some scumbag did to them, as long as they do it before a lot of the development. So no, being prolife isnt bad if you make exceptions for extreme circumstances.
There's such a thing as pro life and pro choice, which is what I am myself. It's not an either or thing, it's a both.
no im pro life i find pro choice people to be cold blooded people
it is not normal to have pain that starts 6 days after root canal when you had no pain before. normal soreness would have been if it was sore the first day when the numbness wore off and slowly got better, it is never normal for it to be worse. call the dentist.
yes
I would call (ring) your dentist, this is not normal.
Hey in your other questions you admitted being gay, and that's cool. But shoving a tampon up your butt is NOT dressing like a girl because we don't do that! If you shove it up your butt, you're going to feel it all day long, which you obviously enjoy. When girls use tampons, we don't feel it at all. So, you have a very warped & unrealistic perception of what it is to be a girl.
According to Obama, you can even go into the girls' restroom when Sasha and Malia are in there. {Get us some pictures, so we can show Odumbo what a bad parent he is.}
wear what makes you happy and comfortable
....why
Healthy Discharge should not smell and should be clear or whitish in colour. If urs has a smell and is yellowish then I would go to the doctors. If u had an itch, then it could be thrush. This is a totally normal yeast infection, and people get them all the time, in their mouth, vaginas, anywhere. Even babies can get thrush. So please don't be embarrassed to go to the doctors about it. Sometimes after taking antibiotics, people end up with thrush too. The treatment is just a cream usually, and/or a pessary. However, it is best to go to the doctors as it may be something else entirely. Good luck
It is hard to say. It could easily be normal discharge, but it could also be a yeast infection. Is this discharge normal for you? If not, it is likely a yeast infection.
It could be a yeast infection. If it has not cleared up by tomorrow, go to the drugstore and buy the treatment for yeast infection. I am pretty certain you can buy it without a prescription now. Then if you use that, and it still persists, see your doctor.
It's thrush. You'll need treatment once your period has stopped.
Hopefully the girl you want to have sex with hasn't seen very many penises in her life (if you are 14), and so she probably doesn't even know what one looks like. I remember when I first saw a penis, I realized it was not located anatomically where I thought it should be. Because I thought it was located about where a vagina is located, sort of lower, and between the thighs, not up front and hanging, like it does. Anyway, she's not going to be a genius connoisseur about what a penis should look like anyway, so therefore, don't worry about it. Also your size is within normal range, anyway.
That's pretty big for me at least and I'm a girl. Girls act like they want it really big but in reality it's too scary and I can't even put my finger up there it hurts so bad. So not being big enough is the least of your worries. Second of all I really think your too young to have sex and it's gonna make you feel guilty
This probably wont help I'm 13 I'm 6.5-7 inches erect and your 5 in yes that a good size for your age as the average is 5.5 inches so yes
You're far to young to be having sex, you should wait till you're about 16 or so. And yes, 5 inches spins above average for your age, but just cause it is doesn't mean you go around abusing it.
I bought this ProlargentSize first time and it gave me a longer penis, a stronger *****, longer time of erection and increased my blood flow. All these things resulted in me having sex again and again. Now after that, I have become a constant customer and I intend to buy it agai n as it has no harmful effects what so ever.
I am 15 and am the same size, but because you don't want anybody telling you that you're still growing, you basically don't want anybody telling you the truth. You are actually a little bit above average for your age
A lot smaller than 5 inches. You should not have a problem provided you do your homework and remember even at 14 you can probably give her a baby, so Precautions. < M.
5 and/or 6 is the average size im 15 about to turn 16 in s couple of days and my Dick is around 6 to 7 and im not trying to condone you into having sex but if u do use a condom because u can get her pregnant and ruin nut life
Eat lower fat meats and cuts of meat, and don't eat too much. For example, fish and chicken have fewer calories than beef, so try to eat more of those. If you want beef, select a leaner cut - lean hamburger over. regular hamburger; tenderloin over prime rib. Cut out other caloric things, like sugars, fats, and excess carbs. Exercise daily. We lose weight when our caloric input is lower than our caloric output. Eat less, exercise more, lose weight. Good Luck.
The Atkins Diet is most popular with Americans.
Cut out the fat meat products - sausages and things are fatty and don't lose much of that fat during preparation (unlike baking bacon, for example). Sadly salami (the crack cocaïne of meat products) is fatty ....
low carb diet
turkey and chicken are best for you i've heard tuna and fish too, but i hate those
You mean how small... and you didn't say it what age... But for an adult penis, age 16 or older to be considered micro would be 2-1/2 inches or less erect.
Under half an inch
Small... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
Under 3 inches erect.
Under 4 inches erect generally.
it is anything less than 3 inches erect
do you mean how small
<7cm
Wear tighter underwear or more that one pair at once. There is also athletic support underwear.
Difficult to do- need to wear briefs, pouch style are best- -boxers are worst.
Put something in front of it.
Why would you want to do that. All these guys trying to get it on. < M
Well you could put your shirt over it.
put it in a water bottle
hold something in front of yourself
I want to loose weight for the summer but im late as f u c k. I want to buy weight loss pills but idk which ones any suggestions that worked good for you? I guess my question is. If i waist train, keep a healthy diet, drink the weight loss pills, drink alot of water and exercise here and there i would loose most of it by mid of july? My original weight is 155 i am at 170 right now. I would like to be at least at 150
I got Weight Loss Green Store Tea product one month ago and it already seems to be working exactly as advertised. In fact, so far I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it gave 6 lb. I recommend to visit Weight Loss Green Store Tea product !!
Losing
Try the Adkins diet along with exercise.
Try listening to sleep hypnosis or ASMR videos on YouTube. Avoid electronics and bright lights. Listen to music, read a little, exercise during the day, sniff lavender, make a story up in your head, keep your room's temp down, don't drink caffeine at night, or breathe in and out really slow. I hope this helps!
start at 1000 and count backward in you mind. Clear you mind of any other thoughts. Don't drink coffee or caffeine after 3 pm. Don't stare at computer screens before you go to bed. Darken the room.
Try tensing up all your muscles for 10 seconds or so. When you release, you should feel more relaxed. Maybe try music or a podcast? I listen to David Attenborough when I can't sleep. If our mind won't stop racing, try envisioning a dream (one you've had or one you've made up) or tell yourself a story with your eyes closed. Take deep breaths.
When I go to bed and can't fall asleep I jack off twice shuve my dilido up my asshole and then I'm exhausted and fall asleep fast. Better yet you suck me off
Get off your computer lol. Maybe take a Melatonin pill or some morphine or something
Get drunk.
Masturbate, lol.
My face is always red.Not the entire thing, just my cheeks, and eyebrows. It doesn't burn or itch. It isnt just dry skin either. It wasn't always red, it started around when I was 9 and I am now 16. It is always red, whether I'm hot or cold or asleep or awake. The areas that are red usually redden even more when I work out or eat foods with a lot of sodium or if I'm embarrassed, but doesn't everones? Just kinda confused on what it could be or what I can do to treat it. (My mom has done some research on the web and doesn't think it's rosacea). Thanks for any help or advice!
Just how it is sometimes
So just yesterday I was helping my parents move our washing machine, and I decided to pull it side to side from the front of it and I guess I accidently sprained my back because after sitting down on my computer later that day for an hour and getting up I noticed a pain in my lower back left side. But today morning it seems like its not as bad as it was yesterday. Should I just wait for it to heal?
There really isn't anything else to do. You could take a couple ibuprofen and put a little heat on it, at night. But, it will get better on its' own. After you recover, talk to someone about core strengthening exercises ( planks, etc) and stretching.
Take Advil or Aleve according to the direction on the package. There's nothing that a doctor can do for you.
Take a couple of paracetamol and rest your back until the pain has gone .
Yes any one can carry an std.
Hillary Clinton does
No. Only the Trump and Hilary supporters carry those.
Yes, they can
You are a racist con; I am Funky the Snarky Troll
yes
Yes. How else would heterosexual guys get them?
yes they can and so can guys
Conservative girls do.
Not at all. Some of the most successful guys in terms of scoring with girls also masturbate a lot.
It depends on what you mean by excessive. Once a day is normal. Even twice a day sometimes is ok.
yep
nope, it does not work like that
Lot of us guys have that issue, Can be really annoying. I have found for me, if i work out or run early in the morning, then cool down and shower, I usually don't sweat as much during the day than if I don't have a morning "sweat". When I don't I can just break out in a sweat doing almost nothing. Might try that and see if it works for you.
or you could be really out of shape, excercize regularily, then over time as you exert yourself you have the energy, you dont get fatigued, and you dont start sweating immiediately, to the point you gotta be working pretty hard to break a sweat
buy shirts of different material, like cotton
It can be. Maybe you need looser/ more ventilated clothing. < M
Ok so im 15 & i had my appendectomy (removed appendix) two days ago & in three days im going to see my gf (5 days after surgery) & its both out firsf time so were both realllyyyy anxious. Im just wondering whether i should risk having sex so soon after surgery & if so what would be the safest position to do it in?
You are only 15 years old??!! You probably shouldn't even be having sex to begin with considering your age, but if you must, to answer your question the best solution would be to abstain from sex until you fully recover from your surgery, the last thing you want is to screw something up in your body and then you end up being out even longer.
Well, you are 15 so it probably won't take you very long to finish, but in any case I suggest that you try her on top. It won't be dangerous to have intercourse after an appy, but it might smart a bit. Maybe settle for a ******** this time.
If you want to inflame the area even more and risk having to go back to the ER because you hurt yourself again, ok :/ give it a couple weeks... actually, a couple years, a 15 year old shouldn't be having sex
No you should not risk it. Three weeks at least; six weeks is better; especially after abdominal surgery. You've waited this long, a little longer won't hurt.
If you had it removed 2 days ago I would worry about sex for a a long time
id wait. youd want your guys' first time to be perfect.
Perhaps you should plan your first time for a different time????
I enjoy masturbating and I get great pleasure ejaculating. I love to watch my penis erecting, ejaculating and returning to it's flaccid state. My body feels great afterwards.
i feel relaxed and serene after discharging a load of Ji zz
Slightly tired, due to use of hands continuously with no break.
i tend to go to sleep seeing as how i do it right before bedtime
Yes, much harrier than a normal 14 year old boy. But you already knew that. But its not a big deal. Some men are very hairy, with lots of body hair... and some men have very little body hair at all.
Thats completely normal, youre a guy and that is what it is... You grow hair coz youre on puberty, some guys have a lot of hair some dont, i have also bro.
No, you do not have too much hair. Your legs are hairier than a lot of guys your age, but a lot of people find hairy legs sexy. You're fine.
Normal, guys start growing hair down below first and it gradually goes upwards as you mature.
You are fine hairy boy. Enjoy. Regards.
Nope. Completely normal
That's just your genetics. You'll be snuggly warm in Winter :P
It's better than a bleeding heart.
Troll
Stop shoving gerbils up your asshole?
You should absolutely always put the gerbil inside a lubed condom before shoving it up there. Rookie error I say
Good grief !!! because you are an asshole, nasty *** person. Use a penis as your animal.
Maybe shove a cat down there to kill the gerbil. Should do the trick
Cus your a sinner and a fornicater
You answered your own question in the details box
Animal abuse. Sickos.
Should go to the doctor and check !
I am 28 years old and I've come to the point where I'm tired of living. Life seems one endless, mentally exhausting ordeal. I don't feel suicidal and I don't want to hurt my family by dying, but sometimes I think "what more is there to life?" And just want to sleep. I do have schizophrenia as well as depression and anxiety and I take medication for it since the age of 20. I never had a job and am studying at university to earn some diplomas.
Do what i did when i hit this same pit. Find your adventure and make it happen. Hike the AT Visit a new country Join the foreign legion Find something that speaks to you, apply yourself to it.make it happen.
it's quite normal but you have a lot of living left to do and if i was you i would talk to a doctor and go from there
Nope
Best advice is that you speak with your medical team and explain how you feel and see what they say. I expect you are on some meds and these may need adjusting.
I feel sorry for the people around you. Stop being Lazy and go take a shower, stinky.
Mental illness does that to people.
you must stink like a pig
P.U.
It should NOT take you 5 months to get an extraction appointment. I think you are just trying to avoid this. It may not be ok if you keep waiting and it gets infected. You might think getting a tooth pulled is a big deal but it is not.
here is really no way for anyone to predict whether it will cause infection before then. It might be fine or you might wake up in agony next month. or the month after that. I would find a different dentist if it were my tooth
Hi Chloe, Im a dentist that just read your post. Email at willman61@yahoo.com and I will help you with your fears and possibly treatment.
That's a good thing about being cut. Very low maintenance. I wouldn't deliberately not dry, but you don't dry your d!ck after swimming and it's ok.
Most of you guys don't know jack about cock , just because you are cut don't mean you got some sort of right to dis uncut guys and big yourselves up , guys with foreskin have very little trouble with infections better everyday comfort and more fun masturbating .
Nothing specific is likely to happen, you will make your underwear damp and it may be uncomfortable as a result. Had you been uncircumcised then things would be different as the excess moisture under the foreskin can lead to infection.
if you walk around naked, it should dry naturally. if getting dressed you should dry it gently. rubbing too hard could make you all excited and you'd need another shower!.
Nothing. If you are uncircumcised, you will accumulate bacteria and later have a painful and contagious infection.
The sky would fall. Jupiter would send a thunderbolt and your penis might drip on the carpet. < M
It'll be moist and ready I guess.
Nothing. Apart from the fact that it might get rather smelly.
Ok, as per ur race

I know a rare few people who have supposedly died from it, but at the sametime my family eaten red meat since they where kids. My aunt who has lived to be 102 ate red meat everyday for all her meals, she died due to other causes unfortunately. Lots of my family members eats red meat and there healthy and pretty old. My friend on the other hand is a strict vegan and is hacing health issues. Is there an explanation?
Vegans do not under stand that we have to have protein in our diet to survive, this is a known fact, If you look at farmer red meat ever day most live well into there 90,s Red meat does not cause cancer Never has, this is a myth started By vegans ,
Everyone has different weaknesses. Some get cancer after smoking a short time and others smoke 70 years with no problem. Same with meat or drinking or anything else. It's all a crap shoot.
Same here. And yes, my sister won't eat meat and her health sucks. I hope she is getting your protein from someplace.
The clear urine is from drinking all that water. It's actually better for you to be hydrated enough for your urine to be on the clear side.
It means you've been drinking a lot of water, most likely. I also drink a lot of water and my urine sometimes has barely any color. But in the morning i drink coffee, which causes my urine to be a darker yellow.
Clear urine means you are well-hydrated. It's fine.
it means you are sufficiently hydrated. dark pee means you are dehydrated.
consult with doctor
no it doesn't
I do that. I put a towel on the edge of the counter to keep from rubbing my d!ck where other d!cks may have been. If the sight of a hairy a$s bothers you, you're in the wrong locker room, and that's your problem. Nut shaving is kinda private, face shaving is not.
Real men don't have junk. I always shaved nude at the gym, so did most other guys. No reason to cover up with a towel,no guys did that at my gym-- (YMCA). We showered together so not a big mystery down below, and used the steam room and sauna and hot tub all nude. So no biggie to shave nude. Depends on the gym though, was a member of one where guys were prudes and wore towels to the showers, where they promptly took them off and all guys were nude together-- did not really make any sense to me.
Well it's a locker room that's just what goes on , we're all guys there an know what a pair of dick an balls look like so it's no big deal, we all have the same thing, he doesn't have his junk out for you if you don't wanna see it that bad then pay no mind to it an just do your thing.
It is not actually rude to remain naked in the locker room whilst shaving one's face. However, there is no need to be naked and so it is preferable to put on at least underwear once dry after a shower.
Yes!! Young boys, and now girls are in there. I know its a locker room but use some common sence, people probably don't want to see that.
I think you're right, he should have covered up....he was either showing off, airing out,or a million miles away thinking of something else....no way to know, just yrll HEY how about a towel ???? that should snap one out of it....
It's not rude, just being a man.
If it offended you to see that, then don't look. Quit worrying about other people and worry about yourself.
I would only if there were few others there, otherwise no.
i agree with you thats too much
Eating 400 calories is going to put your body into starvation mode. It would take a very long time to actually lose any weight, and worse yet, once you do start eating again, you'll gain all of the weight right back and more. It's not a good idea. Proper diet and exercise is a significantly better way to lose weight. That being said, being 110 lbs. at 5'3" is completely fine. You have no need to lose any weight.
You should be about 130 lbs not 110 lbs or 100 lbs. Eating disorders are so 90's and all the guys want a girl with curves like kim kardashian. Start eating & exercising everyday.
I called the customer service number, I spoke to Andera. She was very informative and detailed about Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea , and several other of their products. She was very polite and pleasant to talk to. I received great customer service. Just give it some time to work, you will feel better and loose fat and weight in the process .
I completely agree with the answers telling you not to starve yourself. 400 calories is way too little. By the way, you need help ASAP as some of your other questions indicate something is very wrong.
your weight is fine and you shouldn't lose any
I'm a 13 year old boy and I masterbate 2 times in 1 day but I don't masterbate every single day of the week just once in a while but I can't stop precuming I know precuming is a natural thing but I take showers every morning and when I get out there's clear slimy stuff (precum) so how do is stop this from happening again I know this is normal but I take showers everyday and I don't want to get out and precum just starts coming out it makes me discussed
Lol you can't stop pre kum any more than you can stop hair growth. Your 13 your body will do this until your 25-30 ...at 50 your dick goes limp so enjoy it while you can
? Why would you want to stop that. That happens to me too naturally...I didn't even know it was called that haha. And that doesn't make sense...It should be called like leftover *** from last night Oh. I know. What I do is I like squeeze all it out after cuming.
precum is fun
You can't really stop it. As it's scentless, why worry about it? It's there to prevent your pee from burning semen before it ejaculates. Think of it as 'Mother Nature's lube'.
Just be glad your new toy works. Not sure why you are disgusted. < M
Lol
I am 14 and male. I eat healthy foods and risers ice daily and hit puberty about 2 years ago. What I'm worried about is that all the guys in my school are growing faster and taller than me. I am 5'4 and remained the same for a while. The kids who were 2-4 inches shorter than me a year ago are now either my height or taller. Is it normal for a boy to pause a few months of growing during a growth spurt?
The next time you're in a public place where there are hundreds of people..... Look around and look at all the differences in all the people. You'll see some people that are super tall and skinny, some that are super tall and heavy, some that are short and skinny, some that are short and heavy. We are all different bro. Your genetics is what's going to determine your height. And you have no control over that. It is what it is. No reason getting freaked out about it.
You'll hit your growth summer overnight. When you least expect it. Sometimes happen till 20, but I'm sure since you've already grown it will happen at once.
Once you really stop growing you do not start up again at a later date. You only get one period of rapid growth during the teen years.
Talk to a doctor about your issue
Are you going to have surgery depending on the results of this poll?
Neither
I like vaginas
they can't feel anything way up there. they all prefer the little stubby to the pencil c0ck.
good grief.
why are you asking this?!
Puberty is different for all boys. Some see a lot of changes very early in puberty, while others see virtually no changes for several years. Puberty is a 6 to 8 year process once it starts. And we all develop at different rates and on different schedules.
LOL, you actually sparked a chuckle; ) Puberty is a long process that doesn't stop and make TPS reports. It can take a decade or more, all without 'updates'.
Everyone enters puberty and grows and develops in their own time and way.
You do see physical changes but not on a month by month basis as such.
feburary
Between 1 and 5.
Depends how many hours s/he wants to work. This is a really silly question.
Like any part time job, "part time" means 30 hours a week or less.
Stupid question is stupid.
Alright, I'll just use my own as an example. I've never been abused or anything before, and is one of the top students in my old school. My father drinks and smokes, and my mother didn't really care about me that much. I have an older brother. He's not that good at school like I am, got expelled once, and didn't really know what to do with his life.. I'm a loner, who is imaginative. I'm starting to be depressed, and considered cutting. Other than all of that, my life is going well.
yes, anything can happen in life. their life may have been the best so far, but you never know what happens tomorrow or the day after. since this person has not yet experienced much adversity, one thing that goes wrong can be totally devastating for them and drive them to the point of insanity. if you're saying this person has had a great life and with no reason becomes schizophrenic the next minute, then that seems like a very rare case, if not, impossible.
Of course. Just like a normal person can develop an autoimmune disorder like Crohn's or Lupus... a normal person can get cancer.... a normal person can develop any sort of disease or disorder. The brain is simply one of the many organs in a person's body.... the brain can develop disorders just as easily as any other organ in the body.
It depends on one's habit and behavior. Character forming is considered one of the best qualities in a man. If one is not having physical self-discipline, mental control, social orderliness and if one does not strictly adhere to the highest level of moral standards and if he also has the bad habit of eating junk food, consuming bad drinks and taking weed often, then he may become insane soon.
No, not if they had a happy, stress-free life. Most mental illnesses are genetic or are caused by being unhappy.
I think anyone can suffer an emotional breakdown, given an enormous amount of stress.
Yes, anyone can have mental illness.
No such thing. You can't get taller other than just growing taller.
It won't but if you want to indulge in fantasy, it won'r hurt you either
no such thing and you start shrinking by age 30
You're an idiot. Trump is the best of the worst of the candidate line up.
True, " Homie da Clown" wasn't we saw right through him. However, you turds got played the whole time. Yet somehow we have more Republicans than usual and big names leaving the PARTY. Ha ha ha!!!
Well if he's really a democrat then democrats should be voting for him...
Like all good business he plays both sides against the middle.That is why he will make a great president
To me he is transparent. If he's elected he'll be the puppet of CHENEY, Rove and Gingrich. He's a chameleon.
So what?! Does it offend you that Trump USED to be one of YOURS?!
haha somebody put your question in STDs category.
No, but I have. I felt a tremendous release of pressure being released and it became somewhat therapeutic seeing my pain be expressed. However, I stopped two years ago because if I ever wanted to be happier, I would need to learn to love myself and treat myself how someone would treat a little kid. I found different coping methods such as writing and acting, and became clean. It saves more time, and it is overall less destructive and deteriorating to me as a person.
Yes. I've been cutting since I was 10 and now I'm 15.
Yes unfortunately.
i used too long time ago but i got help for it
what do I do? He says its from heat. We put sab on it. sometimes we use baby powder. He told me not to worry. Last night when he took off his underwear I could see where like a green puss oozed out during day. Its about the size of a quarter. He has had it for about a month or maybe little longer. He gets mad when its time for sex because I tell him it kinda worries me...cant help it if Im scared. What can this scab be? Thank you.
Seriously, don't have sex with him until he is cleared by a doctor, and the scab and puss is long gone. If he doesn't like that, tell him bye. Fact is, he lacks good sense for any civilized male with a girlfriend.
Just tell him that you will not engage in any sexual activity that involves his penis until he visits a doctor, finds out what it really is and gets it taken care of. I would have to agree with Biff, it sure does sound like Herpes. I assure you, it's not from heat. And "sab" (whatever that is) and baby powder aren't going to do anything to make it better.
Sounds gross and the guy should be putting antibiotic ointment on it -- certainly not baby powder! That is just bizarre. If nothing else, vaseline. But really needs to go to a doctor and get it looked at, and get a prescription for antibiotics. Otherwise his gear may really rot off.
that's not from heat and absolutely do NOT have sex without a condom with him - that's nasty - most likely an STD - herpes is my guess - there is no cure for that - which if that's what he has means you should NEVER have unprotected sex with him - if that's the case, i would end the relationship, since he probably get it elsewhere and he's an idiot for not taking it sriously
You should never use baby powder during sexual intercourse. The powder acts has a mild abrasive and also absorbs moisture and will cause your vagina to become dry quicker and suffer irritation from the friction of the penis has it it enters the vagina try using a proper sexual lube product , it will help reduce the friction
i would refrain from bl ow jo bs
Your dentist probably saw something interesting in teeth xrays
Only your dentist will know. Nobody else has access to your dentist's brain.
Your dentist probably saw something interesting in teeth xrays. I would ask your dentist what he saw in the teeth xrays.
You'd have to ask your dentist.
probably that he saw something interesting. there is no sense being embarrassed to ask, he is the only one who can answer

There are many ways to lose a lot of weight fast. However, most of them will make you hungry and unsatisfied. If you don’t have iron willpower, then hunger will cause you to give up on these plans quickly. The plan outlined here will:  Reduce your appetite significantly.  Make you lose weight quickly, without hunger.  Improve your metabolic health at the same time. Here is a simple 3-step plan to lose weight fast. 1. Cut Back on Sugars and Starches 2. Eat Protein, Fat and Vegetables 3. Lift Weights 3 Times Per Week
Better not to focus on losing weight fast, better to focus on long-term health, losing weight fast usually equates to faddish diets that can be incredibly damaging.
Just stop eating so much and go do some exercise, like normal people.
a balanced diet plan and exercise. also take regularly green tea
Follow this diet plan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD2g4I1O...
a good diet and excercise
Yes
Yes I love being uncircumcised and having foreskin.
as you will read on here the uncircumcised have a lot of problems with their co cks
Just be glad that both of you are able to decide for yourselves whether you like it or not and can decide what you'd like to do or not do. A lot of us aren't able to make that choice as we were cut a birth.
I love it, it's great having a foreskin!
Go for medical checkups
I would never sit on one. Yes, there is no telling what you can get.
You'll be fine. Just don't lick them.
WASH YOUR HANDS PLEASE. Clothes also. As long as you dont get anything inside you, Then you should be okay.
Well, my personal guess is that you will grow to about as tall as one of your grandfathers, so about 6 2 or 6 3 is my guess.. but the khamis roche calculator says you ll be 6 0.5" if you re 15.5 and 6 1" if you re just 15 and the CDC (the inaccurate calculator) says 6 2.4 if you re 15 6 1.7 if you re 15.5
youìll stop at 24 yrs
Could still be growing, no way to tell until you actually stop.
It's pretty unlikely now.
It's normal
That's normal
You urinate once day? That's hardly often at all...
It's necessary, everyone must urinate once a day, the great King Beezlbub said so
You should normally urinate at least once a day to get rid of all the liquid waste that your body no longer wants. Why would you not want to do this?
you drink tha water bad
um?
Some parents do, others don't. Honestly, you should be thankful. A lot of kids out there grow up not knowing **** about sex because their parents were too shy to talk about it, and end up being scared of it, or getting pregnant way too young. Sure, it's awkward, but it's better for you in the end. Thinking of sex as a normal thing is much healthier for you
No, it's not normal. I would try saying something to your mom like "I don't want to hear about what happens in the bedroom". Explain to her that it makes you uncomfortable, or when she brings it up, say "can we talk about something else". She should automatically know not to talk about that sort of thing in front of you, but maybe she is trying to be your cool friend and not your mom. There are moms that make bad judgement calls at times.
Just ask her to stop if you feel uncomfortable, I'm 14 and my mom does the same thing
its fine. she should be open about it, ask her for tips with masturbation and use her dildo. try having sex yourself
So I'm 20 I started masturbating when I was 15 and I've been masturbating every single day since then, In time I've noticed that my sperm quality started to degrade over time it was white and thick before now it's clear almost water like also the quanitity decreased as well, any suggestion what might be the problem and how to fix it?
Theres no problem in it, your semen becomes watery and clear and the quantity decreses because you did it everyday, we have different tolerance or limitations some guys just need a couple of hours and some migt need days. I suggest you take a rest and stay fit... You might need some time to regain your semen back to normal.
Your sperm is invisible, what you see is your semen. Sounds normal, semen can change in consistency and volume over time.
Take a break. I once took a one month break and it was..... explosive.
naaah, everybody does it until 70 yer old and more...
for the past two days I've been feeling this constant thirst. I have been diagnosed with severe anxiety and have been to the doctor many times. I had a blood test but that was 3 months ago. Should I be concerned about this thirst? or could it be a side effect of anti-anxiety/anti-depression medication. This is really freaking me out as I am convinced I have diabetes and that it will lead to me having a heart attack or something else.
Constant thirst is a sign of anxiety, as well as mouth breathing (associated with anxiety). It is also a recognised side effect of some anti -anxiety and anti - depressant medications. Undiagnosed/uncontrolled diabetes causes more symptoms than just an unquenchable thirst . Even if you did have diabetes - which you do not seem to have any real evidence of so far - it would take many, many years of you neglecting yourself, your own health and your diabetic control before you'll have a heart attack.

Cos they always have been. Even in Tudor times when being fat was seen as good being rich and slim was not a bad thing, then Victorians had tiny waists, and it has escalated.
Because overweight is unhealthy. Most people who want to be healthy aren't going to consider your criteria for desirable sex partners as their main concern.

They smell worse when you accidently drop one in public and you have to feign innocence!
Then buy a bigger toilet. The place not the object.
actually, the toilet encapsulates the aroma and magnifies it for your nasal pleasure.

A bush native to much of north america with a very distinctive smell; steam distillations of the bark are used as a skin tonic.
It's an astringent or agent that has binding effect. Its botanical name is, Hamamelis Virginica. It's soothing when used as an after shave lotion.
The liquid is used to tighten the skin, so it used to be an aftershave. It is still used for hemorrhoids. The liquid is a tincture - Juice of the plant is distilled then dissolved in alcohol. The alcohol gives the liquid anti-bacterial properties.
It's a type of antibacterial treatment for wounds.
a shrub with fragrant yellow flowers that is widely grown as an ornamental. American species flower in autumn, and Asian species in winter.
Used for hemorrhoids and insect bites to stop itching.
a good skin cleanser for some
I do, yep. I run twice a week (used to be 3 times, but I'm cycling a bit more instead)
I have always had asthma and so I have never been able to run far. I like to walk and run slow back and forth
No I do not like to run . I get enough exercise doing my job .
To the food table yes.
Yes .. Its relaxing
yes it is very helpfull for health
no i don't

Yes. Quick and easy solution is there for this specific problem. The solution for you is to pray honestly and sincerely with ardent devotion, implicit faith and unshakable belief. Your genuine prayers will never go waste. It will be suitably rewarded soon by God. If you want any wonders or miracles to happen in your real life, you should adopt this simple method.
Anxiety/depression is common but easy to treat. tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It's an excellent antidepressant that works wonders.---- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole, new, healthy, confident, happy person.
You might find a quick way to do it. But it's never easy. Try to get some help dealing with these issues, if you can.
There is NO way that is both QUI*CK and EASY. The FASTEST way is to shoot yourself in the head, but it is NOT easy. The EASIEST way to get old and fat and die of heart disease, but that is not quick
Life goes on. think about what you are doing before you end something beautiful.
My doctor prescribed it five days ag and I have a terrible reaction, It burns so bad I almost cried, my skin is all peeling of my face, my face looks like I got sunburn and I can barely move my mouth open. I called the pharmasist who said to stop using it and call the doctor tomorrow. If I put on liquid banadryl will that help or just sting more?
Benadryl won't hurt it. Wash off the epiduo, but stop washing your face after that so that you don't dry it out further. If you try it again, use a very thin layer, almost like you're putting none on. The more you put on, the worse the side effects.
Wont help. Just let skin heal. Get these pads - they wont cause burn like epiduo, but will definitely help with acne - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Just leave it and wash with cool water. Call the doctors as told. Benadryl might make it worse
Best answer I got with your limited resource is rub dirt from outside it has to be dry to absorb what's in your skin rub it in good the rince try not to get it in your eyes
Ive had heart palpitations my entire life. I've under gone testing since I was young. Doctors have never found anything wrong and say its just stress induced. You do need to go to the doctor to be checked. Don't panick, your probably fine.
Your chances of dying? Very, very remote. Palpitations are incredibly common (pretty much everyone gets them at some time or other) and virtually always harmless. They're often caused by things like being tired, too much caffeine, too much sugar, smoking, stress, and anxiety - meaning the more you allow yourself to worry about them, the worse they'll get.
Nothing is wrong and this is all imagination. kids don't have heart issues. Heart palps aren't dangerous.
See the doc
talk to your folks, talk to your MD
Please go see a doctor

Talk to a mature and trusted friend who has good beliefs. Tell this friend what is going on and see what that person has to say. Although that person isnt a therapist talking about your issues does make someone feel a little bit better even for a little while. In the meantime go to the dr request a therapist. Depends how your insurance works to pay for the therapy. Stay strong....ive been there and it was sooo bad. Even now I still feel depressed but before it was soo much worse. A friend would talk to me and hear me out and he still helps me to this day.
Try writing. Write a story! It helps me a lot and I love to write. When you're done writing, curl up in bed with a heating pad and all your stuffed animals and sleep for a long time. That always helps me. Or if you have a headache, use an ice pack wrapped in a terrycloth towel and the heating pad around your middle or in between your knees. I hope I helped and I hope things get better for you! Stay strong!
Please seek help immediately. families can be the least supportive but if you are feeling this way then please speak to a doctor as soon as you can. they are there to help and give you support. sorry I cant offer more supportive advice but it sounds like you may have depression and anxiety and need a bit of extra support and the doctor is the best place for that. also consider seeing a counsellor. good luck hun.
See a therapist. They can help you put your family into perspective and figure out ways of dealing with them.

CARBOHYDRATES raise sugar levels. How much carbohydrates is in the type of bacon you are planning to eat? In most cases, when it comes to bacon, the carbohydrates are so low that it won't hurt your sugar to eat as much as you want. Now, on the other hand, over eating on bacon might cause you to develop issues with high cholesterol.
Yes
Yes, it is okay for you to eat bacon in moderation. So a small amount such as two or three slices once in a while.
The preservatives used in Bacon and Deli Meats are carcinogens.
Nahh give me the bacon I'll eat it for you
eating porky pig will clog your arteries, if that's ok with you, then eat away daddio....
My sister was 7 when she was first diagnosed. I pretty sure those symptoms will die down after a while because she too used to get really thirsty, she would have to pee every 5 minutes ( literally ), and she would get hungry. But she doesn't have those anymore. If it's something your worried about tact your doctor. But I'm sure it all goes away
It is not normal, as the insulin is supposed to stop hypo attacks, which means that you need to see your dr and find what is the best dose for you.
Keep checking your blood sugar and you will know what is going on.
I think you're lying -- I don't think you're only 15; I think you are much older than that. I've never known a 15-year-old girl who had boobs that big.
Breast sag. Its what they do. They are made of fat. There is nothing that holds them "up". The only time boobs are perky is if they are SMALL or FAKE. Your body looks fine. I'm not sure why you think it looks anorexic. I don't see your rib cage.
Breasts are meant to sag, so when you have children it's easier for them to breast feed. A lot of girls have breasts like that. You could moisturize them and try boob toning exercises.
you are a normal healthy weight for your height, and when you are 40 you will notice that your nipples start pointing down at your toes instead of out at the world.. which is what sagging is. your breasts are not sagging they are normal
are you serious? you are 15 it is not okay to post a picture like that to the internet.
I'm always bloated, at least 3 days a week, I get full fast. I just ate 1 3oz salmon, half cup of rice, 2 boiled eggs, and 1/2 Romaine lettuce with some ranch and cheese. That's like less than 600 calories. I feel full. At first very full, but in like an hour or 2 I feel hungry again. Is it cancer, IBS or what?
It might be Rhabdomyosarcoma . My friend's stomach was extremely bloated but she would get bad pains after she ate . So idk .. But go check it out . She went to like 4 different doctors and they all thought she was constipated but it ended up being cancer ! So go go go !
There is no way to tell you. We're not doctors, and your symptoms could be any number of things (including just normal for you). If you have real concerns, please go to your doctor or a health clinic, don't rely on answers here.
see a doctor
as the vagina is a muscle then no it doesnt get lose, even after childbirth it returns to normal.
Yes
nope that is a myth
You can be apprehended if it is evident you are about to do something physical. The police officers I know say they only arrest the person if they get in their face. That's an arrest that goes on file. They will apprehend a person (different than an arrest, no Miranda involved) momentarily if they are causing a public nuisance, which may or may not end up with a fine. It's a fine line.
In some cases, yes. You could be charged with causing a public disturbance, drunk and disorderly if you've been drinking, resisting arrest if you're being arrested (NEVER resist arrest, EVER. Fight the arrest legally using a lawyer after the fact, but do not resist arresting officers, you may be killed by accident in their efforts to subdue you. Most cops are good people but accidents can happen even with experienced law enforcement officers. And even if you aren't killed, your arrest experience is sure to be a lot worse if you resist.)
Yes, cops can arrest you. Sometimes cop even makes arrest that s/he knows is illegal. In this case, it's legitimate, because you can be charged with "disturbing the peace" and then while being arrest, the cop can tack on "resisting arrest".
You can be arrested for disturbing the peace for yelling at people.
Yes, that is threatening behaviour and likely to cause a breach of the peace.
Depends on what you yell. No threats or cursing (technically illegal). Why would you yell? Never works.
Not the best plan. Yes they can arrest you.
Yes I would think so.
Yes ...
disorderly conduct. why would you ever do something so STUPID?
I've made no achievements in my life except transforming my physique. Other than that I GOT NOTHING! No reason to live anymore. I can't feel any emotions AT ALL other than anger, depression, anxiety and despair. Call me whatever the f**k you want but please help me. It's like I'm on fire from the inside 24/7.
I am not so impolite to throw poop at Christians. They seem to enjoy it more on a plate.
Atheists do not believe in gods. That's it. That is all you can say about atheists and all we have in common. The naming and classification of species, taxonomy, is science and has nothing whatsoever to do with atheism. There are five kingdoms of life (six in the USA) Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera. The USA splits Monera into Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria. As humans are not plants, fungi or bacteria we have to be animals. That is accepted by theists and atheists alike, it is only rejected by ill-educated fundamentalists.
I thought that's pretty much what social media like this is. Aren't we all dodging poop coming from all directions, or did I do something wrong here?
Stop making Christians look like terrible, argumentative and hypocritical people by posting stuff like this. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU SHOW PEOPLE THE LOVE OF JESUS THAT YOU BELIEVE IN. You're making it so much harder for the rest of us here dude come on.
Because we are stupid, dumb, and ignorant. We care so much that we live here 24/7 just to see the Christians talking bad about us. If we are smart, we should leave and live a meaningful life, but we are not smart enough to comprehend that notion. Therefore, we just have no life.
I express my opinions, and some people equate my opinions with poop. As it is with the Bible, sometimes a metaphor must substitute for a literal description.
Because although humans are scientifically classified as animals, we still are civilized beings. I am not even an atheist, and I hate to be rude, but your argument is weak.
Uh they already do! Don't feed them!
Lmao, I had the same worries when I was at that age. I wouldn't say you're too young, just make sure to keep yourself clean and not use anything that would hurt you. Its nothing to be embarrassed about and you have every right to ask on here, its better you find out the right way than the wrong way :P research different ways to do it. All I can say is research a lot. I was uneducated at that age and started the same time as you, I often worried a lot that my mom or doctor would know. Just make sure to lock your door to prevent embarrassment
Well I'm 14 and I finger myself when I masturbate, and yes it does feel good. The doctor probably wouldn't be able to tell unless you accidentally cut yourself with your nail or something (which by the way, hurts a lot, it's happened to me before. If you have any other questions feel free to email me at alexah954@yahoo.com. Hope this helps!
I was under the impression that people who are only 11 years old are not allowed to use this site. And if it's embarrassing, asking a million strangers about it, some of who MIGHT be perverts, is a silly way to get the information.
try using a hair brush, markers, electric toothbrush, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, try find your moms dildo/vib when she is not home and have a great orgasm from that. all this can go into the vagina. dont worry. dont put finger in your anus put it in the vagina. masturbate much as you can and anywhere you can. you and your friend should masturbate together when your together at home or at her place.
No of course not. I lost mine at 32, should I hang MY Self?
Troll.
How could you have, since this question shows you're only 10.
If you feel that bad about it you should notify others so they can avoid the actions that create so much stress.
Congratulations on your marriage.
you missed out on crabs and the clap at 14. so sorry.
No. Autoerotic asphyxiation is not the answer.
Was your dad rough with you?
Please do. Then we can get back to grownups asking questions instead of your BS...
Just say "mom I'm bleeding from down there" that's how I told my mom and got her attention right away.
just go up to your mom, and say "I got my first period" that's what I did. but yes it can be awkward. or just tell your mom you have cramps and then carry on the convo from that. maybe even ask her if it's nornmal (which it is, but your hinting). good luck!
There's no way to avoid the discomfort. Come out and tell her so you can get the proper hygienic products to take care of yourself.
Your too young for that.What you need to do is to focus first on your studies. There's always time for it. That matter is serious and not a game to play, you might regret at the end.
If you don't know by now, you have a serious problem. G00gle it.
You can rub your clit. (Look up a diagram from Google to learn where it is.) you can also use your handle on your brush or toothbrush to play the role as the penis. You just stuck it up where you pee.
Have you tried looking online?
watch some videos.
punch yourself in the face until you pass out
Let the pet pooch lick your clitoris
put your finger in your vagina and go in and out. rub your clit with you finger then lick your finger after.

If it has to do with pain then it has something to do with you not him. If he was in pain then it's his problem. Sometimes it isn't a serious problem like in your case it's normal because it's your first time. Also doing it with a big penis may influence it and the different sex positions are more comfortable than others for women
You're too young to be pregnant. Besides having sex is an unsafe thing to do even after when you went through puberty.
You're not too young to pregnant. You should always be tested when you're sexually active. No matter how much you say you trust him. It could be because you're tight and haven't been penetrated often. If it continues go to planned parent hood.
Do you also drive? Do others drive a car without any info about it? Why are you having sex without total info? So like taking a joy ride in a car without knowing how to drive, you will crash. A sexual crash means STDs and pregnancy.
No it hurts the first time because your hymen broke or they call it your cherry being popped. It's not uncommon to bleed either
It means both. He has a disease and now you do too. Plus you're going to get pregnant.
maybe it means you were not aroused and he did nothing to get you wet. in otherwords he knows nothing about sex
he doesn't have a disease and your not gonna get pregnant and it hurt because you rushed it
The first time usually hurts.
lol....girls these days get into it sooo sooooon i guess
I think you need counselling. You should consider speaking to someone just to make sure that everything is okay
Just put up, it's not a lifetime!
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
Your penis is quite big at 7 inches. Just go easy and it will be enjoyable for both.
I take the Prolargent size product to increase my penis size when I need to be, and it works very well. Just take it when there's action and you'll be glad I did. Almost ripped the sheets.
Most girls would find that quite large. Just try some and see.
Someone way too young for sex. It would have to be someone who has not gone through puberty yet. Girls go through puberty as young as nine. Please don't have sex with a girl that little.

Type 1 is genetic- you can be really thin and eat little but still have it. Type 2 is from eating too much sugar. Your body stores glucose (sugar) as glycogen and then it gets converted back when you need sugar. If you have diabetes, you don't produce insulin (the hormone needed to convert glucose to glycogen) Glucose concentration becomes too high and you urinate it out. You end up with low blood sugar levels. I'm quite sure both types of diabetes can be helped by insulin injections etc., but I would recommend you do some research about what is best.
I think your born with a type one diabetes. and the type 2 you just get it for being fat and not doing enough exercise when your meant to. or its probably the other way round i don't know.

No, you don't need emergency help, but you do need to see a doctor. You have a bacterial infection (that's what yellow/green pus indicates) and you need proper medical treatment. In the meantime, put antiseptic on it or boil some water, put one teaspoon of salt in the water, let it cool to a temperature that doesn't burn you, and then dab on the wound with a clean flannel or some cotton wool. You need to clean this wound thoroughly. Salt water is a very good antiseptic. Your doctor will probably prescribe antibiotics as well.
That's infected pus. Wash the scrape thoroughly with warm soapy water, you can sterilize it afterwards with salt water (stings less than most other things and does the same job). Pat dry, don't damage the scab afterwards. Take an aspirin, but that should be enough.
Yes or Dr asap
Okay, last year I was diagnosed with servere anxiety, and also depression. Last night I found out my best friends brother was talking about me behind his back and so were his friends. I've been feeling really crappy and I just don't want to go to school. Of course my mom is going to make me go to school, but I was just wondering if it was acceptable. Thank you.
You ll eventually get over it. Just remember: Anyone can betray anyone. EVERYONE talks about others behind each other s backs, yes it may make you depressed, but it s life and you need to learn how to cope with anyone that talks bad about you. It s a cruel world
That isn't a good enough reason to take off from school. What will you do tomorrow. Your problem will STIL Be there.
I have this odd red lump that hurts so bad on my breast that showed up out of no where, I have no signs of breast cancer other than this lump! Most cancer doesn't hurt (I've had cancer before) so I don't think it's a tumor, but breast cancer is in my genes and I'm nervous... (I'm gonna get into some detail now) the bump is the size of my nipple and it hurts and it's red, I have a picture below and I know it looks like a nipple but it's just the lump!! Someone please help I don't know what to do
Sounds like a nasty zit or sebaceous cyst. If you have had cancer before then you know the best person to ask is your doctor. Surely you were given appropriate counselling when genetically tested?
Sounds like an infection.
So why are you asking us? Are you begging for breats exams fropm streagners? this isn;t Craigslist, you know./ CALL YORU DOCTOR and ask
Go to a female OBGYN to be tested. She will know what it is and how to treat it.
Look, you don't get breast cancer when you're 12. I am 13, and last year, I was CONVINCED I had breast cancer, to the point of crying every night. Well, I went to the doctor and guess what? It's just puberty. Apparently puberty caused one side of my breast to grow faster, leaving what was like a lump. But hey, it was nothing to worry about. I guess if you're worried see your doctor, but kids basically never get breast cancer.
At age 12 your risk of breast cancer is statistically ZERO. what you are describing sounds NOTHING like breast cancer. Sounds likely to be dried sebum, the natural oils in your skin. The average age for breast cancer is 62 and 80% of people diagnosed are over age 50. Talk to a parent or guardian.
No dear. Not even remotely close to even being considered breast cancer in any way shape or form. You are more apt to get a invitation to Hogwarts. No they are not dangerous. Nothing more than your still developing breasts. Speak to your doctor if you must so he can explain that you are fine.
You are too young to get breast cancer
I suggest you see the doctor if you are worried about them. Breast cancer at age 12 is extremely unlikely.
Those are white heads that you get around puberty. Nothing to do with cancer.
no you don't
No. Being obese is caused by eating more calories than you burn in a day. This can lead to diabetes and hypertension which are risk factors for developing coronary artery disease.
No. Obesity can cause coronary heart disease, hypertension and Type 2 diabetes though.
Yes
No - it's the other way round
No. Circumcision makes no difference to the growth of your penis except that if done before puberty the rim of the glans may flare out somewhat more. It was good that you were circumcised at 12 as your circumcision has a chance to fully settle as you pass through puberty, thus giving you the ideal combination of being loose enough for strong erections but as tight as possible for maximum stimulation. A tight foreskin (phimosis) would NOT have loosened up as you passed through puberty but might actually have got worse when the glans grew faster than the foreskin could expand.
No, no logical reason a circumcision would stunt penis growth.
Circumcision does NOT stunt the growth of your penis. Only a small amount of excess skin is removed from covering the tip of your penis. The idea of stunting growth is a fiction deliberately put about by anti-circumcision activists to try to bolster their failed campaigns.
No, your penis size should be based on your genes. With that said, it does make your penis smaller than it would have been -- it is penis reduction surgery. A Canadian condom study showed that cut men penis size is on average smaller than natural men. It is quite obvious that removing some penis will leave less penis.
Just Saying.. Most 12 year olds CANT stretch or pull back there foreskin. its normal. through puberty it detatches and loosens... I think you just circumcised yourself for a no good reason. Sorry mate
Nope. It affects sensitivity but does not affect growth. < M
sure not, it's a fake and stupid stuff
This is getting more interesting by the minute. 12 hours ago, in this category, you told us you injected marijuana into your arm and your penis is growing, but you are a woman. In the same time period, in Singles & Dating, you told us you smoked too much weed and now your eye is falling out. NOW, in that same 12-hour time period, you tell us you left a tampon in your butt for 4 hours and now you can't get it out. You have a s**t load of problems, don't you?
Oh, hahahaha! I agree about the **** load of problems, looking at your profile you've injected drugs and grown a penis, lost your eye and set your anus on fire all in one day! And for the record, tampons don't go up your butt, they go up your vagina! This is another reason I can tell you are a dude!
Once, I couldn't get the hoo hoo out my cha cha cause the string just came out so I went to the ER, where the cha cha healing lady insisted I was imagining it cause she couldnt find it by the entrance of my chacha, I said, look deeper, incompetent cha cha lady, and thank dog she looked deeper or else I would have gotten a cha cha infection. But if this is the rear end, eat a lot of oily stuff and wait for the big poop.
hopefully you are just a troll, though from the amount of people in the emergency room with weird objects up their butt one can never tell. it is possible that it got pulled up into your colon which would be why you are not supposed to stick anything up there that is not specifically made as an anal sex toy. this would lead to a blockage and death.. so if you are for real go to the hospital. unless you are a troll in which case one less troll in the world is not a bad thing
Just in case you really DO need help...sit in a tub of water, and try to get the water to go up your butt into the tampon, and it will soften up, and then be able to come out.
That's because that's not where it goes. Have fun at the ER.
Why in the butt? Are you trying to be funny here or just what? (After looking at your other very simple, dumb questions I now know your just trying to be funny.) Why is my penis green? HELP I HAVE REALLY BAD PERIOD CRAMPS!!!!? Maybe you need to make up your mind just what you are first.
Tie the string to a dog and throw a tennis ball.
Get it with a tweezer,Plus it being in your butt is wrong its supposed to be in your vagina
Dry fûck yourself
Chill! That white stuff you're talking about is discharge, which is what every girl gets before their period or when they're not on it. I remember I had that scared feeling last year because I thought I was pregnant when that white stuff came out of me. I was stupid cause I've never had sex before but still thought I was pregnant lol. STOP. WORRYING. You're not pregnant. In a few months you'll come back and laugh at this for thinking you were pregnant. Note: everyone girl gets the white stuff A LOT. Don't think you're pregnant cause you're not
You should not talk to your parents about this. They would have you committed involuntarily to a psychiatric facility. This is a grotesque thought process you've got going here. This should be proof enough that whatever meds you are taking for anxiety, they aren't enough. I'll be as vulgar as you've been. The only way you can get pregnant from your father is by having sex with your father. You are 17 years old and you know this already.
Just stop. You aren't pregnant from sitting on a chair after someone who was wearing underwear.
If you have to say "I'm not a (insert noun here)," then you probably are one.
Hello I m asking about my nose. When I was 9 year old my younger brother put chickpea in my nose.I blow my nose but nothing comes out So I looked up my nose i the mirror and there didnt seem to be anythin.i didnt told anything my parents beacuse of fear.now I m 25 year old but I have fear of that chickpea is there any complications that may occur due to a foreign object in the nose.. That incident ruined my life always please help
Nothing to worry about. You should forget all about that chickpea. It's gone. It went 16 years ago. If you need to know for sure just ask your Doctor or Practice Nurse to have a look in your nose and see if they can see any trace of that chickpea. I guarantee they won't. But at least you'll have the reassurance of them having checked and made sure it's not still lurking up there! Oh, and Rick was kidding when he said it will have given you a tumour. He was saying 'the idea that the chickpea is still up your nose after all these years is stupid...so here's an equally stupid answer'.
By now it's been sucked back into your brain (which explains a lot). It's rotted and probably created a tumor. You don't have long to live, you should get your affairs in order.
How neurotic. Is that. How can anything be stuck up your nose for almost 20 years, it would have melted in a couple of days.
If it is very important to you even now, then tell this to a doctor and take reassrance from them that it is no longer there.
I can suggest a Homeopathic remedy for your condition if you can give me your details specifically your individual symptoms apart from this problem what else do you feel. Are you feeling worse when you usually wake up in the morning ? And are most of your body pains and aches left sided ? Please put all of what I have asked and any other details and symptoms you can tell me here and your disorder can be cured without any side effects or any sort of complications ! Take care and God bless you !
Thin skin is from reduced collagen production, which is an expected part of aging. There isn't anything that effectively treats it, to date.
Take vitamins to strengthen your skin, and be sure to eat healthy! You should tell the doctor, though as skin ages It gets more fragile. Dying skin peels away faster.
Get some blood work done. Have them check your white and red blood cell counts. See a doctor about this.
fms is highly overdiagnosed...have you even been to a doc about the skin..try a dermatologist...that could be related to your pain
Go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
your darkest hour comes before your dawn.... please don't try to harm yourself. please. i had a friend that did that and it was bad just think about the people or friends that will miss you the people that stay up all night thinking about you and crying their eyes out. new leave earth with your problems god put you here for a reason so please live your life. ps. love you!
Consult a good lawyer. Request him to make a fresh deed of will.
Go out, help people. simple as that. that's why were here .JESUS SAYS SO
And are you asking us for advice? Or something else?
usually when you do not get enough exercise your body does not have a greater demand for calories. If you do not put a demand on your body and brain there is not a great demand for nutrition but no matter what you still need to eat a little something though out the day. Not just dinner. Your brain will thank you as it needs calories too. .
Less iron in you're body
Depression
You're going through puberty
You are probably growing.
It's thrush. Ask the pharmacist for Canesten.

As much as you want. Vitamin C is water soluble, you just pee out anything your body doesn't use. This also means that really anything over 1000mg is just wasted, as you will just pee it right out.
Taking more vitamin C than your body needs in a day will result in your body purging it, via urine or you'll just get diarrhea. Vitamin C does not act as an antibiotic.
Take as much as you want, your body will remove via your urine any excess it doesn't need. You do understand that vitamin C won't do anything to your sinus infection, don't you.
If you are taking vitamin C on a regular basis, take Ester C instead. It is less acidic.
Even if you take too much, to my knowledge you will just urinate it out. So you will do no harm in taking lots
First of all, that's too much carbs. not enough protein. Second of all, anything less than 1200 calories per day is counter productive because when you consume less than 1200 calories/day, your body burns muscle instead of fat for energy, and really slows down metabolism. Skipping breakfast is ok (it's called intermittent fasting - google it), but try to each chicken or eggs for lunch (plain grilled chicken, not something like a burger or wings), and try to have like an egg salad for dinner (watch the dressings - if you can without, it's better). For a snack in between, take a banana and a protein bar).
Add a banana to that toast and peanut butter and you have a healthy lunch.
If you are worried about calories you shouldn't be eating peanut butter. You can get a more filling lunch sandwich with salad and sardines.
yes,it is enough for lunch but you should eat more because you get only 1000 calories by eating this which is less and not enough for your health.if you eat less you will be unhealthy and can suffer from many health problems.
sure. you should probably eat a little more though. you know that
it is if it fills you up
I can`t see that an hour either way makes a difference.Better to do that than forget to take it.
It would be fine. As long as you take it approximately the same time every day, you will be fine.
It's fine, just change to 8.
No, it will be ok, just keep to 8 pm in future.
Never wear a tampon at night, use a pad, all night is too long to have a tampon in,just use the pad that suits you, i just wear the same brand pad all the length of the period, you can wear tampons during the day if you wish, just change them often, about every 2-3 hours.Ask your mum, she has periods!
I'm a pads girl and wear them for the entire 8 days of my periods, including at night, although I do use a heavier kind at night up until about day 6. I've been shown the tampon too, and would like to use them but not yet.
Ok I'll try to explain. When I get my period it lasts for six days normally. I have used Always pads with wings for about 3-4 years now. On day 1, my flow is pretty heavy and I use the pads with the pink wrapper, at night I use an overnight pad with wings it comes in the purple wrapper. I use the same product for day 2-4. The 5th day is usually a lighter flow but still there and I use a pad in the yellow wrapper and still use the purple wrapper one at night. I change my pad about every 3-4 hours normally.
What's the point of your question? You use the same thing on the second day and remaining days of your period that you use on the first day! You change it as often as it needs to be changed. A woman just KNOWS what to do - that's all. I don't know about other posters, but while I was still menstruating, I used tampons during the day and slept with one during the night.
Pads Tampons with a pantyliner Overnight pads for nighttime
always used tampons right from when I was 12 and I first started my periods. Yes you can sleep wearing a tampon, but try not to leave it in longer than 8 hours
I use tampons on every day of my period, and always have since I was 12.
I'm a boy but my best friend she just wears a organic pad at night.
i've always used pads like my mum. my aunty offered to show me how to use tampons but i never tried. the idea of having a ''mini dick' inside of me didn't appeal so i rely on pads or in worst case scenarios... toilet papers :(
Just do, you kniw when to use as you do
First, see a doctor to find out why you are so seriously underweight (50 pounds). That's who should tell you what to do to gain weight. You are in serious danger of a major illness, so you need professional guidance, including talking to a nutritionist. In the meantime, eat at least 2000 healthy calories a day, 135 carbs. No sugar, no white flour. 1/4 of your diet should be protein, 1/4 whole grains, 1/2 fruit and veggies.
Lift weights and eat tons of protein
Eat more , move more .🍔🍟 I don't know what a gerd is though . ❓
put mayo on your salad
Negative influences of meth or other drugs can not be passed by a male user thru his semen. The only impact on a fetus from drugs is thru the woman who is pregnant and using.
Eww -- why would you have sex with a meth head? Surely you can do better than that.
Not to be nasty but I imagine if you swallowed enough semen or other bodily fluids you might. Otherwise no.
I don't believe it can. Use a condom
As much as I know(finished medic high school). nope.
no it can't
😂😂😢I'm sorry that was funny
Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. So you are there! Slightly above-average, so no worries. There are a lot of men a lot older than you that would love to trade places with you. Me included. You have me beat buy a lot.
Average for 15 is adult size-- 5.16 inches. So huge in terms of length and girth. Top 5%
Completely normal, alot of guy wanted to have that size and few had been luckier.. I feel quite jealous about you.
normal
One way of being able to establish this is if the has a crash/come down period. If she appears to be very tired or lothagic very shortly after she has been hyperacitve then this is known as a crash/comedown period which happens shortly after drugs like heroin, ecstacy or cocaine have been taken
It is a loaded question. I don't know its exact weight. It depends on the level of mental confusion. A loaded question or complex question fallacy is a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption (e.g., a presumption of guilt) I mean without seeing the actual patient, I cannot guess or diagnose the illness.
Ask her straight because it looks like she's on drugs.
Not sure about now however when my son was born it is something they just do and you sign. It is cleaner for circumcise,never have I seen a circumcised man look odd or strange in anyway. You must of got it done while an adult. Maybe the physician can undo it without any nerve damage to you.
Allow your circumcision to fully heal before passing judgement on its appearance. You need to get used to masturbating slightly differently, after which pleasure will be as great as before. There is no difference in the sexual sensitivity of the penis before and after circumcision - that is a proven medical fact, not something made up by the anti-circumcision zealots.
well they do have a surgery where they can reverse it now
And is good to have a big dick
You are a bit overweight, but only by like 5 pounds (2kg). You should be fine
You are kind of chunky
You are fat.
i pretty much grew up as an only child. I didn't have any friends due to anxiety, and i just wish i had a big brother or big brother figure in my life. I feel like a lost little boy inside, I have no one to turn to or someone to hangout with and to do activities that i missed out on.. I always see these 2 kids down the street hanging out, going for bike rides, skateboarding, they even play baseball etc. it makes me sad when i see them because it reminds me of what i didn't have but wanted badly.
Know what libraries are ? Got libraries where you live? Go spend some months years learning reading about how to fix ur life. Change ur stinking self centered thinking and create better life for self or NOT.
Go ahead troll and eat some.
You are really weird. Wash your hands.
First off WTF!!!! Second, sure go ahead, whatever floats your boat, you'll just get really sick and start to see dancing blue bunnies everywhere, develop a very high fever, and die.
you can get severally sick from eating human waste ..
Sure.
As long as you can swallow it
Yes, it is safe to have sex during her period, as long as you are both healthy. Even though it is extremely unlikely that she will get pregnant during her period, it is not impossible. So use a condom or other birth control.
There is no such thing as safe sex wither she is on her period or not. You should always use a condom.
No such thing as 100% safe sex.
Up the ârse. Yes.
Your having sex and you cant afford a pregnancy test ..I think there like a dollar ninety nine on e bay and you don't have to be 18 to get one from a pharmacy
you may indeed be pregnant its already may id suggest getting a pregnancy test
how is your diet? have you changed anything at all?
how the hell do we know? go to the doctor
After a female has an orgasm, her body releases a number of hormones, and one of these causes sleepiness. So while you shouldn't have to masturbate everyday in order to fall asleep, if you can't sleep every now and again, this is definitely a great alternative to sleeping medications (and without the nasty next day drowsiness)!
I don't have to, but some times I do just for fun, and youre right- it does help to fall asleep
Yeah, I do that, too. But before that I'll just try to watch some ASMR because that also helps sometimes. I don't know, you might want to check it out if you're not weirded out by it or anything.
Yes. There is a 9 to 12 hours time gap though
sometimes it helps,i masturbate 2- 3 times a week,your body does release hormones that cause you to feel tired or sleepy. Melatonin, which is a sleeping hormone, is what causes you to feel tired.the more you get tired the more Melatonin is produced in your system.
That's fine,whatever is right with you is ok.you are relaxed after masturbation so you will go to sleep if you are in bed.
Nope
im a guy but i dont really need to do that in order to fall asleep...
Hurry up and fall asleep.
Yep
All flushes are medical quackery. I'm a liver patient--if there was a liver flush that helped the liver in any way, don't you think my liver specialist would have recommended it? My mom died of renal disease, after years of treatment including dialysis. You telling me she could have flushed her kidneys and improved their function? Excuse me, but that's total bull. Kidney, liver, and colon flushes "work" by making the person believe s/he did something good for his or her health, not because they actually did anything good. It's the placebo effect, only highly profitable for the makers of the flush products.
Normally kidneys keep themselves clean. It's only since the onset of nut-jobs and proponents of junk remedies that people now have to do these ridiculously implausible cleansing rituals.
Just nonsense. The liver and the kidneys are 'detoxing' your body all the time. Where did you get such quack ideas?
"Detox" has no meaning outside the clinical treatment for poisoning or drug addiction. Your body has evolved to very efficiently remove waste and toxins - you cannot improve upon this without medical assistance. "Detox" and "flush" diets and products are pseudoscience.
Your body does a "kidney flush" all the time and a sign that it worked is that you pee.
If it all it works, no pain while micturition [passing urine] and discomfort of any sort.
Gallstones are not in the liver.
Bogus and quackery.
Yes, of course, depression is a state of sadness, life is difficult at times and thats hitting you hard, so you are depressed, suicidal is comleaty different and is when you have just given up on everything, the 2 can be linked but depression can be very mild to very extreme,
Yes you can have depression without wanting to kill yourself. Not everyone with depression has suicidal thoughts. Depression is a long lasting low mood that affects your ability to do everyday things, feel pleasure, or take interest in activities. It can feel like concentration difficulties, body aches, irritability, anxiety, apetite changes etc. Suicidality or suicidal thoughts is just one portion of that. So they can overlap but they don’t always go together.
Of course. Depression and suicidal ideation are two completely different things.
Yes. Depression means you feel generally sad or uninterested in life. It can range from mild to extreme.
For course
You will when you become an adult
In the past one year I've been taking efforts to exercise regularly and eating as much as healthy as possible and with this I came down to 55kgs from 68. But then with added on stress and dining out with friends often I gained upto 5kgs even with exercising whenever I get to. I'm a student and sometimes because of which can't cook all the meals at home. My problem is that just until a few months back I could get rid of all cravings but after I started going out with friends I can't get rid of cravings completely and that's what has caused the weight gain. Tips for helping me getting back on track would be truly appreciated!
This is what you do: First off the 2 most important things are your calorie and macro intake (macro's are fat, carbs and protein. In order to know your daily intake search for the IIFYM calculator on google and fill in everything (and as goal say maintain weight). After that, first look up how many cals and macro's the food has you want to eat when dining before any other food, because you know that you'll eat that food on that day. Personally, I use the MyFitnessPall app, real easy to use, but all in all its about calories and macro's. Tracking cals and macro's changed my life.
It's easy! Simply be cognizant of what you put in your mouth. What's causing your weight gain is YOU not controlling your cravings. Try ordering something healthy, like a salad WITHOUT any dressing or a burger WITHOUT special sauce and mayonnaise.
Weight Loss Green Store Tea product works !! I lose 2 pounds in 14 days. I eat healthy and work out every other day. I highly recommended for people that has constipation problems.I am purchasing my second order now :)

Having a hot bath or shower for sunburn is really bad for the skin. For any type of burn always run cold water over the affected area. It's not a cure all, but is a good stop-gap measure if further treatment is required and is designed to take the heat out.
Cold bath or shower. After standing in the shower and pouring cold milk all over yourself. Weird and kinda gross, but it really does help a bit with the pain and cools the skin more than water alone will. You'll just need to wash it off afterward, so you don't end up sticky.
Ice in Cold Bath.
A tub of acid will take that sun burn right off no problem
Yes. I've been smoking for 60 years and I'm now 83 years old. People keep telling me it's bad for me.
Yeah I've known that since I was 5 actually
seriously...no kidding....I wondered why there is a warning on the side of cigarette packs
No ****. More likely to get diseases
yes it defoe is
Are you sure?
No. HIV negative means someone does not have the HIV virus. But nothing in medicine is 100%. No test is perfect. Someone may take a test that shows no detectable sign of HIV but they could still be carrying the virus and pass it on to someone else. If someone has the virus and shows no signs of it, that is called 'undetectable'. People who have HIV can be treated and reduce the amount of the virus they carry down to the undetectable level meaning it would not show up on a test but they still carry small amounts of the virus and it could be passed on to someone else. It is just that the risk is lower.
It means they dont have HIV so you are safe unless they just got infected reently and the antibodies dont yet show on a blood test yet
No
No.
Yes it is healthy for a 6'1 to be 164 pounds. If you have a small body frame, it can be from 152 pounds to 164 pounds, it is the ideal weight for 6'1
I'd aim for 200lbs. Why you'd want to be weak and skinny, i have no idea. 180lbs at the least. This is with a low fat percentage 8-15%.
You must look very skinny then.
yeah, but if anything you might be too skinny
Well girls do that regardless of the guys size however your plenty big in fact your above average in size. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into that size range with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some degree. Hope this helps.
Yes, your penis size of 6.7 inches is definitely okay. It is bigger than average and a very good size.
"She's mocked one of her previous boyfriends penis". Really? Be prepared she mocked yours when you become her ex. BTW, you size is good, but until you give more details about her, I won't have sex with a woman who mock her ex's penis.
your size is fine and if she laughs at it she's nor worth your time and effort
You are definitely showing signs of schizophrenia. Go see somebody and they can help you. You'll feel so much better, I promise.
You need to schedule the next available counseling session as soon as possible.
See a doctor asap.

You don't have to diet, you just have to eat right and get regular exercise, making sure you work at a caloric deficit.

I did this yesterday and it was fun and cool: go to your craft store and buy a fairly large white canvas. Paint it solid with acrylic paint. Then cut out stuff from a magazine, glitter, ribbon etc and modpodge (eh spelling) it on then spray it all with a shinning finishing spray! It looks really good in my room:)
Crafting
distracted from what? one fun things is crochet, and knitting. you can make useful stuff and pass the time.
Please see http://www.circinfo.com/post-op_care/car... for valuable, medically approved advice on the care of your newly circumcised penis. There are millions of circumcised men in the world, happily fathering families. Circumcision does not reduce the sexual sensitivity of the glans and certainly doesn't prevent one becoming a father. Give your circumcision plenty of time to properly and fully heal and then enjoy it for the rest of your life - your sexual partners will!
Of course. Circumcision doesnt cause infertility. It is just for hygiene thats why other guys are circumcized.
Given about 90% of adult American males are cut, and most have kids, yeah.
yes
you should follow this tip if you like to do it. 1.take a small bowl and add five table spoon of yogurt in it then add one egg yolk in the yogurt and one lemon juice then mix it well and apply it in your roots of the hair and wait until it dries then rinse off it with water and then apply shampoo(the shampoo color should be white and it should be moisturizing shampoo).after applying this you will see the difference in only one wash.if you don't like this tip then you can also use an anti dandruff shampoo
Rub a drop of Tea Tree Oil on your affected scalp area after taking a bath. Just a drop or a few drops coz you may not like the smell.
after washing your head rub apple cider vinegar in your scalp, wait a couple of minutes and rinse. It doesn't get rid of it forever, but it reduces it for a day or two, in my experience
Use a shampoo that contains selenium sulfide.
No. The sun emits radiation, some of which can be harmful if you look directly at the sun for a length of time. A picture does not emit the harmful rays that do the damage. So you could stare at a picture of the sun for hours and it will not hurt you.
So, if you take a photo of a river, aren't you afraid it will flood your house when you print it out ? It's the same thing...it's a photo , it isn't real. It can do no harm.
Only if there's a glare.
You've never been called confused with a genius have you
no it won't
can i have real answer im scared
No
I am against circumcisions that are preformed on UNconsenting people. If you are not the person getting the circumcision, you should not be the one deciding. That's a violation of a person's basic rights. Its their body, their choice. Very few people are going to be happy if you cut off a part of their body without asking. Circumcision is the same way, if given a choice most people don't want it and would be furious if you ignored them.
I am definitely against the Circumcision. Are you smarter than GOD who provided you the extra cover to protect the most sensitive part of a man . It also facilitates him to masturbate with great pleasure. It may be removed only if there is a medical problem. Regards.
I am not against circumcision as long as it is the decision of the person to whom the penis is attached who decides for it. I believe every male should be able to decide for himself whether to be circumcised or not, whatever his reasons for or against it may be.
Orange Bear is dead right , if your pleased you were cut as a baby you are victim of the culture you live in .
No... It's clearly a cut above.
The two most violent nations on Earth routinely practice this barbaric "cutting off the end of a fella's todger", and THAT is the root cause of their violent nature, since their young men grow up frustrated & angry at the world because they cannot ever achieve genuine sexual satisfaction the way INTACT men can.....so yes, I am very much against it...
of course, i am not a fanatic religious or some
Yes, no point in it, and it is rare any guy actually needs it medically.
Absolutely NOT. I am very pleased that my parents were well enough informed to want me to have all the proven lifelong health and sexual benefits that it brings.
Yes, you should try to get down to 105 pounds.
No, you are underweight by about 10 or more pounds.
No. That is actually "Light" for your size. Best of luck!
Not at all!! That sounds like you are the ideal weight!
not at all
Yep, that's definitely a problem, you better get your freaky penis disease under control before it travels to your whole body, then when you're walking around, your WHOLE BODY gets hard, and grows big for no reason. Bless you!
Stop looking at Kim kardashians aśś
well you don't have a disease but it would help us if we knew how old you were
Yep, that's called the erection disease
I just wanted to see what everyone said to this retarded question
Sounds serious, you should amputate it immediately.
this is so deisgusting, how could you ask that you perverted weirdo get a life it's gross STAY AWAY FROM TURTLES
Cheap and disgusting.
Turn it around and fuc k it.
Anywhere from 115 to 135 pounds would be fine for sure. Stop worrying about weight. Just eat a healthy diet with enough calories - at least 1800 to 2000 - and get lots of exercise.
If the girl had hydrogen in her lings, probably 80lbs. There's a weight.
Use a BMI calculator online, it will ask for your height and weight, then it will calculate your total body fat percentage, or if your underweight
110 lb
Around 110lbs - 120lbs I guess.
So for 2 weeks I dieted and lost 10 pounds. For some reason I just got lazy and unmotivated so I ended up gaining all the weight back in the past 3 weeks... I feel so disgusting and am so mad at myself. It was like loosing the weight in those 2 weeks was a complete waste of time! I don't know what to do to stay skinny and not constantly loose weight and then gain it all back again?
Don't think of dieting as a thing that you do just for some time and then go back to what you did before. Think of it as a change of life style, something you do long term. If you worked out what made you lose weight do that and then treat yourself to things you love now and then, remember to exercise regularly. And please don't do anything just to lose weight. Take your time and do it the healthy way.
Your body wants to be at that first Weight. It'll always be that way. It happens to me too and requires vigilance and determination. Like learning to ride a bike. Fall off, get up, start again. No laments, regrets, or blame.
no,your school doesn't start too early. you are used to go late except the two days that's why you are thinking that you are going early to school.
In Australia we generally start between 8:45-9:00 in the morning...
Grow up! That's not a men's health issue or concern.
I have a healthy way to loose weight. It's a non GMO organic health and wellness plan with It Works. The first product is called thermofit which helps curb your appetite without stimulants so no shakes!!! It also gives you energy and boost your metabolism!!! Then there's the greens which you drink. It gives you all the fruits and veggies you don't get in the day!!! It's a natural detox and natural energy!! Lastly are the Fat Fighters....you take these after your largest meal of the day!!! It help you body not absorb some of the carbs you have eaten. I would be glad to tell you more!!!!!
Chop of a hand and half of the forearm. Alternatively start doing about an hour of exercise daily, but this won't lose you the desired weight in time
Surgery. The healthy weight loss rate is 2-3 pounds a week.
Eat leafy salads only and walk a few miles a day.
Don't try. Any wight loss, passes through your kidneys, that would do more harm than good.
Get an over the counter Water Pill. And flush the water out of you.
You can't.
Drink a gallon of water and just wait for the release.
You might be able to,but you can't dictate where it will shrink from.

I'm a 16 yo girl a couple of weeks ago I had sex for the first time we used a condom but it broke, he has no stds, he didn't ejaculate and my period had ended two days before, about 4 days later I started feeling pain at the end of urination, and I have intense lower back pain like it hurts so much I started crying, could I be pregnant? Or could it be something else? I'm kind of freaking out
That sounds much more like a urinary tract infection than anything to do with pregnancy. Go talk to a doctor. It's a quick test... you pee in a cup, they give you antibiotics.
Sounds like a urinary tract infection. And yes, you could be pregnant - when guys say they didn't ejaculate they did and either don't know it or aren't willing to admit it.
Maybe you suffering from a Urinary Tract Infection (UTI). It is commonly happened when having a sexual intercourse. So if I am you better seek for a doctor so that it will not worsen and will prevent from bleeding.
Lol it's a urinary tract infection hun you'll be fine!!! Just go to the doctor and get antibiotics
take a pregnancy test...but this does sound like a infection. both? if the condom broke theres a 50% chance you're pregnant.
Sound like u have a urinary tract infection...you wouldn't have pains from being pregnant a few days later. Not even close.
You are now a parent. Start picking names.
Yes, masturbation can indeed cause a headache. It is from the blood vessels being constricted.
Not usually though less blood is being shunted to the brain during sex so that might cause a headache.
If you mean "cause" = then no it shouldn't. Maybe you have another problem. < M
should not, but it could
Yes, that sounds like a very typical breakfast for a lot of people.
Yeah that's fine for breakfast! It'll keep you full up until around lunch which is good!
Yes, it is. But why two bowls? I think that 1 small- medium sized bowl of go lean crunch is enough. I also think the banana was a nice touch.
The younger they start eating healthy the better.
Personally, I don't see it as shameful, but it is questionable. Porn actors go through a lot of cleaning before anal sex. I have very, very, very high doubts that all gay men go through the same cleaning, if any. I personally would not like to have to deal with feces every time I want to have sex.
straight men just don't like the image of two men having sex as it is the opposite to their sexual preference .. In the sameway hardcore gay men would think v@gina is a turn off . Society seems to pander around the gaylords needs all the time - you could understand when the GAYS just wanted to be accepted and wanted to be treated the same .. But now there is hardcore unified collective promoting and creating INEQUALITY - through demands on the rest of society for their own preference and sexual alignment
These people are hypocrites as they will object to two men having sex as disgusting, and the same objectors will quite happily watch porno videos of two females having sex which they think is horny.
They never tried it, for one thing. And for another, most people were raised for hundreds of generations that two men having sex was "bad"- it is even stated so in the Bible and other religious texts.
Religion teaches many things are shameful. Then 8,000 years later, God changes his mind. < M
religion and/or closed mind. most men usually do it, but don't talk about
because it's gay bruh you suck at getting pussy so you turn to mens *** bruh what a disgrace
Because its gay
every women have one bigger breast and one smaller, even bra comes in that size, every girl have different growth rate,, don't worry puberty have not fixed end time ,, it vary with girl. don't try any artificial method,, you can use breast exercise or massage.
If she really wanted to leave her husband, she would've done it before she got involved with you. If she really wanted to make sure you were serious about her, she would've done it before she slept with you. If she really wanted a trustworthy man, she wouldn't pick one who'd be willing to sleep with someone else's wife. She's playing you for a fool, and you're nothing but a homewrecker. If you want a serious relationship, then this cheating dirtbag is not for you.
Okey saying you "really like her" isn't enough .. Do you love her ? Thats what truly matters . If you do write her a letter about everything you love about her and how much you enjoyed spending time with her , buy her a bouquet of flowers and give her that letter to read when she's alone . Take her to a place that is significant in your relationship that will make her heart swell and tell her how you feel .
I mean if you really do love her and think that she's the one and you're willing to accept responsibility then I would advise that you propose to her. That shows you're pretty serious and then she wouldn't be as worried about the development of her kids since she will have a stable life with you.
Get out of this situation. Let her take care of her marriage or end it. This is going to be horrible for the kids because she was cheating and due to the way you guys met. Maybe after she's single for a year or longer see what happens. For now get out of this situation.
Don't do it you'll regret it lol trust me. Also don't be the reason her kids have a broken home. If she cheats on her husband why wouldn't she screw you over?
you are dealing with a married woman who has no respect for her husband. you are a fool to believe she would not dump you for another guy as soon as she finds her next victim. you are not that special!. dump her cheating a** and find someone unattached. no one wants to be with a cheater, they do not change.
As a guy, you should be assertive and let her know whats up--without playing games.
a short fat penis is far better for a womans pleasure than a long thin one.
It's a matter of how well you can stimulate the clit on the women. Penis size doesn't matter unless it's micro in nature.
Yes, a thick girth will provide more stimulation to the vagina than a thinner girth- and the length is not so important, most of the sensual parts are in the first couple of inches.
no it doesn't if you know how to use it properly

I have been there. Even now I keep my distance however; it may help to take a personality test and then search out people with similar personalities. I have a couple friends who I really love one I have had for ten years the other for four both have similar personalities that's why we get along. Be careful though if you get someone just like yourself you might get on each other's nerves.
yea, talking is wayyy over rated. I wouldn't stop talking completely but maybe don't engage with people mindlessly in chit chat or in stuff that upsets you. just keep talking to a minimum and you might feel less stressed
You sound unhappy and probably have depression. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft if you are at least 16. It helps :)
You must be very flexible to be able to suck your own dick. When I was 17 (I'm 75 now) I was able to do it while my g/f watched & fingered herself
What good would it do you? Other than a very tiny amount of zinc, there are no nutrients in semen.
No, semen has high concentrated amounts of sodium and it would dehydrate you further and unless you bust cup fulls it wont feed your hunger either. But it would be pretty hot.
Use common sense after a while it would lose it's contents and after a while you would be too weak to jack off you burn more energy jacking off
seeing as i have no dick or semen, no i would just die D:

Just came back from the dentist. First time in 3 years.... I do have tooth sensitivity; whenever I drink anything cold or eat sweets. I ve only ever had 1 cavity. After about getting my teeth cleaned for 15 minutes, my dentist tells me I have NINE CAVITIES. I was shocked, because I didn t really feel pain in any of my teeth, other than the sensitivity. I wouldn t be surprised at 1 or 2, but NINE?! She told me that most of them were small and in between my teeth. I don t think 9 cavities is very normal for a 16 year old. Should I ask my parents to take me somewhere else for a second opinion?
A few weeks ago I had 11 cavities. Was I shocked? Not at all. I Haven't gone to the dentist in like 5 years. It's really no big deal if you act fast and just get them filled. And the filling isn't bad either. If you haven't seen the dentist is 3 years than I wouldn't be shocked for all the cavities you have.
I had nine cavities too. My nine tooth now have fillings. I got them a week ago because i haven't been going to the dentist either due to financial problems my parents are having..
I always go for second opinion but it's your choice. Before putting my braces on, my mum and I went to 3 different orthodontists before we found someone 10 minutes away from our house, 3-4 minutes away from my school and someone who graduated top of his class in University of Western Australia. However, she did clean your teeth and when a dentist cleans your teeth, they clean every spot. And since she cleaned it herself, she would've gotten a clear view of it. There are people who does have 9 cavities. I would recommend limiting yourself from sugary drinks and foods and start brushing your teeth twice a day for two minutes.
Get a second opinion. I was told I had 4 cavities. I went to different dentist to get a second opinion and he told me i had none.
Lol i got more cavities and im younger. I just had 4 pulled yesterday DX
Even i had 9 cavities at the age of 16..no big deal..
you should go to the dentist at least twice a year for check up and cleaning. If she says you have cavities then ask her to show your pics
intolerance of grease can be gall bladder issue, but that usually has other pains and the issue is after removal, sounds like you need to keep a food diary any day you think you might havce a reaction and see if you have a food sensitivity, check with your MD as to how to handle this
Here's a novel suggestion: Since you have seen that pizza and MacDonald's food or other greasy foods do not agree with you, then don't eat them anymore. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure that one out.
You answered your own question. It's the grease.
* Stop eating greasy foods that make you sick. Its not rocket science.
You're too stupid to stop eating food that makes you sick.
Try going to church and read the bible everynight before you sleep..I mean would you not prefer dreaming of Jesus Christ instead of the devil?
Just you talking to yourself
Not at all-- penis size is genetic and helped by blood pressure, sure, but a guy with an 8 incher might not have any higher blood pressure than a guy sporting 5 inches. The ejaculation is caused by the prostate and groin muscles so penis size and blood pressure.
Firt off, orgasm doesn't happen in the p3nis. Orgasm is the release of "happy chemicals" in your brain. Second off, there are zero muscles in your p3nis. I don't know how you thought you could somehow flex it but the p3nis is just tissue that fills with blood.
If I were 12 years old with a mental handicap it would make perfect sense. What's going on? You think bigger means better but it doesn't.
no the so called strength of an orgasm is based on stimulation and desire, having a bigger penis does not give you more of ether and does not give ether to a vagina
Orgasms are triggered by stimulation of the nerves in ones genitals, the size of ones genitals is not a factor.
i'm sorry, but you haven't got a clue, do you?! it's NOT all about the penis daddio...you watch too much porn....with their mutant penises.....and pathetic attempts at love making....just contribute to wrong conclusions by boys with avg penises and no love making skills at all
No. Theory is nice... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Yes, this is a good theory and quite plausible.
Perhaps.
Well I've managed to lose 10 pounds and I still eat pizza so nope, not bad at all. It isn't what you eat, it's how much of it you eat. All that's needed to lose weight is a calorie deficit which means you're eating less than your body is burning. So say it takes 1920 calories to maintain my weight right now, in order to lose a pound a week, I would need to create a deficit of 500 calories a day so I would eat 1420 calories everyday. More if I exercise on those days since the deficit is already built into 1420 calories. Gotta fuel the workouts.
Make sure you aren't starving yourself. Eat pizza maybe 2x a month but just eat more healthy things than unhealthy things and exercise daily. If you cant go to the gym, go on a hike or a jog in your neighborhood. You can have pizza, just not too much of it at once.
Pizza's not the worst food. It does have a lot of calories. Eating 5 slices of pizza at one sitting is not good. Eat smaller portions and don't eat just pizza. Eat healthy foods most of the time. The issue is your total calorie intake. If you consume more calories than you burn off, then you will gain weight.
It doesn't have to be. A pizza made from scratch with say, a cauliflower base, or an almond meal base, would be pretty healthy.
Not necessarily, 1-2 pieces a week is fine. A whole pizza is not.
Eat healthy ot makes losing weight alot easier you can eat pizza as long as you are burning it off in the gym it's not so much what you eat you have to workout and burn the calories.
What KIND of diet? To gain or lose? Actually it is NEVER WHAT YOU EAT...it is HOW MUCH in terms of CALORIES you eat. You will lose weight if the total number of CALORIES PER DAY is below a certain level. So if you want PIZZA...HAVE PIZZA.
From what you have described, it does NOT sound like you are a sadist. It is one thing to not feel empathy when someone suffers... ie. just not caring; it is another thing to take pleasure in INFLICTING the pain. Think Windom Earle from Twin Peaks. Perhaps to an extent, being pleased with someone's suffering could be mildly sadistic. It really depends on what sort of 'suffering' you find to be laughable... for instance, sometimes seeing somebody trip on a banana peel might be amusing although it probably hurt them. Since you say you don't want to feel this way, then it seems you are not intentionally wanting to be 'sadistic.' Don't fret.
More than one possible cause. Sometimes when there has been too much emotion, as with grieving, one's feelings will shut down this way. Or one might be maintaining a vibrational level too low to support caring. Use good nutrition, get enough sleep, avoid indulging alcohol, sex, or drugs, meditate once or twice daily, and dwell in your mind for a time on something or someone you know you care about. Don't worry; you're not a sadist.
Looks like you got special little snowflake syndrome, don't cut yourself with that edge. Bet you also have headmates too, huh?
This is also a serious mental health problem, which you are not aware. Please consult Dr. Varadappa Naidu, in Chennai. He is a great psychiatrist. If you are a good gentleman, he will not charge any fees and the medicines will be supplied to you free of cost.
A sadist takes sexual pleasure in the suffering of others.

Dont get white unless ur teeth are white. I suggest warm colors since it is almost summer. Maybe like orange or red. Pink is also good
Orange
You can get any color you want, your skin color should not affect that choice.If you feel like getting red or purple, get those colors, don t give a **** what other people think
Is there a clear color?
pink is good colour for braces
Steel colour..
huh? sheeeeesh, it's just melanin for crying out loud.
You should never stop Lexapro (Citalopram or Escitalopram) abruptly - the sudden cessation causes lots of undesirable symptoms and feelings. However, since you did this a week ago, you're probably past the withdrawal stage. You could take 2.5, 5 or 10mg and see how you feel. Break a tablet into fragments to get the small dose. Although you're usually told to take it once a day, you can split your dose morning and night. This causes fewer unwanted effects during the day (sleepiness) and at night (insomnia). A proper weaning would be to reduce by 2.5mg each week until you are only taking 2.5mg daily, then discontinue it. Also, your doctor should be aware that you are doing this.
That's a good way to find yourself hospitalized. AD withdrawal can be quite severe..... How about you call your doctor and discuss this all with him/her..... The drug manufacturers don't call it withdrawal.. that has negative connotations... so they decided to call it "a discontinuation syndrome"... and Lexapro is one of the worse.....
Obviously, that is the wrong med. for you. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
He and I are actually pretty worried. This is not a joke, he seriously ejaculated after sex onto my stomach and it was a light purple color. How on earth is his semen almost my favorite color? Is this an emergency? I know I'm not insane, because he saw it too. He says he'll be embarrassed if we ask our families or go to the hospital. So we are trying to find any online info or help first. Why would his semen / ejaculate be purple? This is really concerning, please share any help. Thanks
That definitely does not constitute and emergency. He should consider going in to see his doctor. Odd colored semen can be indicative of blood in the semen, or possibly and STD or other kind of infection.
because he is a lakers fan to his core and jizzez purple

"Ballsack in the middle" I'm crying😂 do you mean your labia minora Hun?
Glasses don't cure the problem. As your vision changes, the glasses have to be changed to keep up. Those same changes will happen whether you wear them or not. All they do is help you see by focusing light to the correct place. If you prefer to think it's an evil plan to make money , then stop wearing them. The only way to get rid of your myopia is with laser surgery, that's why it exists.
They correct vision problems. They do not improve vision without the prescription in front of the eye. It's not like medication to correct a potential problem.
With glasses - Better vision. Without glasses - Worse vision. This stuff is not rocket science. Are you considering something like Lasik instead of glasses? It's an option for many.
Corrective lenses do not improve the health of your eyes. They are simply designed to help you see better by changing where the light that enters your eye his the back of your retina. Unfortunately, your eye sight deteriorates as you age and that is why you have to keep getting different prescriptions.
It's all a cruel trick to keep selling glasses.
Some eye conditions can be helped--even corrected--with eye exercises. But the main conditions that affect the eyes can't be corrected that way.
I am 14 years old. Male. Pretty physically active, and don t feel sick at all. When I take my shirt off I m a tiny bit chubby but can see that the area above my hips both look different. One is bumped out more than the other. I think I can feel something but I m not sure. I really want to see the doctor. I am terrified right now. Please give some insight if possible.
So go to the doctor. I have one hip bigger than the other too, and I don't have cancer. Most likely you are worrying over nothing.
One hip bone is higher than the other? That's not cancer, that's a musculoskeletal problem.
No one is perfectly symmetrical. This could be perfectly normal. If concerned, ask your Dr next visit.
Go ahead. But first take a pic of the vibrator in the drawer so you know EXACTLY how to place it back in the drawer when you're done. Don't use the lube this time. And make sure to wash it with soap & water when you're done. Dry it completely and return it to the drawer (according to the pic). Don't believe all the warnings about diseases. If your mom was engaging in risky sexual behavior, she wouldn't need a vibrator in the first place.
No, you shouldn't use it. Personal items like that shouldn't be shared.
That is not an item people usually share.
I find it highly unbelievable that you weigh 220 and are a size 8 considering that I'm 200ish and I wear a size 16-18 (happy about that too). But it really all depends on where the weight is. For me I have a huge butt which makes it hard to fit into anything lower.
Maybe instead of worrying about clothes sizes, worry about eating bealthier and losing weight.
becuz you can't tell the difference between you and reality
Huge for an adult- less than 5% are that large -- as in 5% of all adult men.
It really depends on your gag reflex.

Sounds like you may have some type of rash or it could just be poor hygiene. You need to wash yourself there with warm soapy water every day and rinse well. Hygiene is everything kid.
Sounds like you wear boxers-- wear pouch style briefs so your balls don't bounce around and get irritated.
u soud lik dem :D also i herd cuting dem off 8=3
do you wear briefs? this could be because your underwear is too tight
Your leg probably felt asleep because you were lying over it during sleeping. It's like after you are sitting for a long time with crossed legs.
1. A sudden shock may affect an organ temporarily. 2. Hopefully, you shall recover in a couple of days.
why did you tell us your dad fell down the stairs? you could have posed your question without that information
Your leg fell "asleep" while you were in bed, that's all.
Let me consult my Crystal ball
Perhaps you were too nervous and lost control of your muscles.
I'm a 16 year old guy, I'm not usually a depressed person, but lately, and after my move to a new school, I've had a fight with my old and closest friends, the new school is terrible, with ill mannered people and terrible education, my hard work is going to waste and I haven't been able to make new friends, the end of year exams also stops me from playing video games, which is something I enjoy doing. I don't want to stay like this. Any suggestions? Note: I don't have any mental illness as far as I know.
It is a surprise to me. Because nobody in this world likes over-depression. I think you should not over-do anything. If you deliberately over-dose the medicine intake, it may adversely affect your present mental health. Sorry. I have no idea to increase your present depression. I can only suggest some positive methods to overcome mental depression. i.e. you should consult a psychiatrist and take proper and regular treatment immediately without fail. Also strictly follow the instructions of the psychiatrist meticulously if you want quick recovery.
Well because it's nearing the end of the year, you'll be able to get back to your video games soon!!! Have you tried talking to your parents about moving to a better school? And as much as it sucks, you'll make new friends. And if they're really your friends, you guys will make up.
Please note that I have significant health centered anxiety. Earlier today I noticed a dead rabbit right in the way of the road so I took a napkin, and used it to grab the rabbit by a back foot and moved it out of the way. So i'm coming back, and my (stupid) friend thought it would be funny to chase me with the dirty napkin, and ended up pressing it into my face. It was clearly dirty after touching the animal. I'm concerned about the filth that came into contact with my face and a little worried. Should I be expecting some terrible disease to take over me now?
The only disease you presently have is that friend of yours. Or a parasite. Unless the dead animal had flies or maggots concentrating on aiding the decomposition process, you won't have anything except road grime. But if you like this friend, carry some disinfectant or wipes in case it happens again.
Wash your face really well and get a new friend! And, if you still have concerns, call and leave a message for your doctor. She or he can call you back and reassure you.
Yes, and some do it a lot. The wife is not always available for sex or even wants sex as much as the guy- plus when she is on her period or pregnant she usually does not want to have sex. And then some guys are just horny all the time. So sure, masturbation is a normal part of a man's life.
well i am happily married 14 years and yes i still masturbate once a day to help me sleep
Yup. Once in 4-5 days - or it gets all stuffy down-there. Gotta get some release and it's easier and more convenient than waking the missus up.
Yes.
Yes, of course
Yes banging the same woman for years gets boring
Yeah , in fact they ask the wife to do it for the man and he simply enjoys it. Regards.
Yes they do.
Most do, while some do not.
Only if they are alive
How many times are you going to ask these sperm questions? Seriously... It's getting old.
Sperm dies quickly.
Nope, not likely
Yes it can.
No
Doubt it would be easy and why would any person do that? Missing out on lots of fun solo sex. Certainly no benefits to not ejaculating regularly and I'd not brag about it.
Yea u can.. just act like u have no penis the only time u have a penis is when you piss and shower... I went 6 months without fapping since then I got mad attention from women
Is one allowed to ummmm order out?

That is stupid... Not easy
LOL... why are you trying to find out? That makes no sense.
sure it is irrational
NO!
Think for a moment how ridiculous that question is.... If that were true every male in existence would have a dull face and oily skin.
no also does not cause blindness. However It is like drinking or chocolate - too much of a good thing is not good for you and you have to exercise a bit of self control. Maybe having a girlfriend would also be helpful as it will tend help you grow up a little more and be there for each other rather than just being there for yourself.
No it doesn't. But being a teenager, over washing, and harsh soaps can.
no

This can be solved like a maths problem. 3 months is roughly 90 days. That means you need to lose a pound every 2 days. Each pound has 3,000 calories. So you need to eat 3,000 calories less than you use every 2 days or 1,500 calories less per day. Using this website http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/#result I calculated that, based on your weight and weight, you use 1,690 calories per day. That means you can eat 190 calories per day on days when you don't exercise. Increase calories for exercise. e.g. if you want for an hour add 200 calories or if you run for an hour add 400 calories.
Im 15 and i lost 60 pounds just by not eating much

Becasue funeral bills cost too much.(Take it from a funeral director in training.)
I got nothing.
Yeah but it involves doctors breaking your legs. Very risky procedure and you would only be a few inches taller. Everyone has their own problems and you just have to deal with them. If you're a woman then you don't have anything to be worried about. If your a guy that doesn't mean you can't do great things the late prince was 5ft 2.
It CAN be done but would be expensive and take many years. The surgeon saws a leg bone and then put it back together with a splint that holds open a space between the two ends of the bone and it regrows in that space making you a little taller. But there is a limit to how far they can be apart to do this so would take many operations to do it. I'm not sure but doing it many times could weaken your bone structure too. I don't think I'd want to even try it!!! Love who you are.
Nope I'm 19 and I'm 5'1. Being small has its advantages you will never have to worry about being taller than a guy love yourself for who you are.
There IS a procedure that involve sawing the FEMUR, and STRETCHING it with titanium rods while it grows back. This is EXTREMELY painful, takes 2-5 YEARS to complete (while you are in a wheelchair), and the result is only about 1" - 2" extra height.
Yes. It's done a lot in China. There are several different types of surgeries. It takes about a year to complete.
There is a "controversial and painful" procedure that has been done a couple of times. It doesn't seem like it is medically sanctioned, though. http://abcnews.go.com/Health/leg-lengthe...
*Not unless its in your genes. Its a simple fact.

Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It's a great antidepressant. It takes 2-3 months for your body to adjust to it but after that you will feel like a whole new healthy happy person. You can inflate bike tires at any gas station. You can lose 10 lbs/mo this way: Avoid junk food, greasy food, starches, carbs, sodas, coffee and alcohol in all forms. Stick with fresh fruits and veggies, salads, eggs, chicken, fish, turkey, fruit/yogurt smoothies and lots of water. Good luck!
I'm sorry you're going through this. Don't skip meals. It lowers your blood sugar, possibly adding to tiredness, depression and lack of motivation. Have something small and healthy. I know what you mean about feeling judged, but you know what? Everyone has some crap about them that they could be judged for. Everyone. So screw them and enjoy your walk. Think about how nice it is outside. If you have a dog, tell yourself you're walking because the dog HAS to. Good luck. You can do it.

'Are white people supposed to be here?' I have no idea. I didn't read the Yahoo terms of conduct. Maybe I'm breaking the rules.
If you read the yahoo terms you'll see it says no white or Caucasians
Any person regardless of color, race, and ethnicity, has just as much of a right to be here as you do
Oh oh!! I got one! Do illiterate people is suppose to be here?

You are what you eat, but in the case of chips you will turn into a lard ball.

No.
Ask your wife why she does not show any interest in making love anymore.
I don't know. My crystal ball's in thefucking shop. Have you considered asking her, dummy? She's YOUR wife.
Maybe she's bored or something.
She isn't getting anything out of it, you need to learn how to help her have orgasms.
Yes. You may feel a bit washed out but you need to relax and not think about having only 4 hours sleep. Focus on the day ahead. It won't do you any harm and you will sleep very well the next night.
Wow. You're shaking? No wonder you can't sleep. Stop freakin out, just lie down. Yeah you'll be tired if you don't sleep more.
So you are freaking out over nothing? That's your problem.
Faking or no...your friend has a serious problem. If your friend is faking, you need to know why. If you haven't done it already, you should google symptoms and signs of brain cancer and then ask your friend questions about it. Then you will know for sure. If they cannot answer, then you know they are lying. As I said, if they are lying there are other serious problems occurring...psychological. How to handle this would depend on your age...and since I don't know that I am not sure how to answer.
Brain cancer is pretty hard to fake. It's obvious and evident in many, many ways and if the only thing indicating her disease is her words, then yes, he's lying.
Incorrect. Your aquaintance says she has brain cancer. If she is lying to you she is not your friend. If she is telling the truth and you don't believe her you are not her friend. Either you believe her and act like a friend or you don't and stop pretending to be her friend.
Ask her what type of brain cancer she has, what treatment she is getting and has her oncolgosit given details of the outcome or how long does she have to live. - Then find new friends.
Why do you think she is faking? Is there a history? I agree with other comments, if she is she still has issues.
If she did, she'd be having treatments, probably surgery. Both make it pretty obvious..
Wait and see.
The word in that sentence means diabetes can be cured. It is a false statement though because once you are diabetic, you are always going to be diabetic until they do find a cure. Changing your diet and getting more exercise may bring your blood glucose levels down but you're still going to be diabetic; once you stop the diet and/or exercise, you body will go back to mismanaging glucose/insulin. Diabetes is NOT a reversible disease. Plus it is really a permanent condition, not a disease.
The word "reversible" in this sentence is an assertion that diabetes can be turned around, and therefore either lessened or abolished. The intention of the writer is not known by reading this sentence out of context.
Depends on why one is diabetic... if you get "Juvenile Diabetes" it is NOT reversible. If you get adult onset diabetes it can be reversed or blood sugar brought down through diet.
It can never be reversible meaning it has gone but it can be cotrolled by diet and exercise.
No cure just control.

That's a common sign of a heart attack, but most heart attacks never involve cardiac arrest. "Cardiac arrest" means that your heart has completely stopped beating - it has "arrested". In which case, you won't know about it because you will be dead.
Yes. 100% of the population will suffer cardiac arrest at the end of their life.
Common in people over 60 years old. Not in people under 40.
Yes
no it's not if you look after your body right

Dunno
The pain i had from my wisdom teeth before the surgery was worse than the post-operative pain. In fact, it was manageable with just Tylenol (the vicodin they gave me for pain just made me throw up and I found that I didn't need to ask for something else). My one suggestion is really just try to do a liquid/fully soft diet until they tell you you can eat regular. I was so hungry that i tried eating normal and that caused more pain. My fault. I had all 4 removed at once, BTW. So, stock up on smoothies and applesauce! You'll be fine. ;-)
Getting put under is better but you should be fine if you stick with eating purees, luke warm soups, smoothies afterwards and drink plenty of water. Also always ice your face with the jaw icepack. It really depends how experience the person is who's pulling out your teeth. Mine was recommended and extremely experienced and recovery was easy. Also you need to sleep upright on your back for a few night so prepare the pillows.
Relax. The actual surgery is nothing if you get the anesthesia and are asleep while they're doing it. The only painful part is eating things that require quite some chewing. I didn't find it as bad as I thought it would be. It's an experience I wouldn't mind doing over.
not comfortable, maybe there are 3 tools inserted to your mouth, 1 for sucking saliva, keeping mouth dry. i don't remember any pain during surgery. after surgery, the doctor will give painkiller, with that painkiller there will be no pain. whenever you start feeling pain then eat that painkiller. after surgery i can ate rice, beef, brocoli, and always ate normal food. i revisit the doctor to have a sewing thread in my gum, removed. but i lately realise there's a valley in my gum in that wisdom tooth area, which can cause food to get stuck then i would need toothpick to get that food out of that gum-valley, so ensure that doesn't happen
I got mine out 5 days ago and am still in so much pain.. the surgery itseld is no big deal, but the recovery process has been rough. I had the woest pain of my life on day 3
I did not enjoy it at all. I had all of them removed by a millitary dentist. I told him I am allergic to narcotic pain killers. He said, "Be a man!". He was a total dick. I was out of comission for three days. Buy something to read!
Uncomfortable. Can't really say it hurt, just throbbed...
Your cervix is capable of dialating to accommodate for a baby to pass thru. No, it is not "done for". He is being too rough, or you are not completely aroused tho. You need to tell him that it causes you discomfort and pain when he does this. Sex every 2 weeks is "addicted"? Lol no. Many young couples have sex several times a day. Every 2 weeks is more like the average that a married couple with kids has.
If his penis is 10 inches long, then you need to kick him to the curb and find a guy of normal length. No woman's vagina can accommodate 10 inches. His length is not necessarily going to harm your cervix, but it's sure as heck going to cause you a lot of pain. A woman's vagina is not long enough to accommodate a 10-inch penis.
You Speak Up when it Hurts- a caring partner Does not want you to have Pain He >Can> Control the Depth and Force of his Thrusting but you Must Tell Him!!!
He should not be forcing it in all the way. He needs to realize it's causing pain for you. It's about both of you, not just him. Take a break from sex and tell him the boundaries next time. Good luck:)
See your doctor. You can have an easily treatable condition called "H PYLORI". All you need is a round of antibiotics to usually take care of it.

I'm super white and my areola/nipples have always been super pink. so recently I noticed they look beige and they're no longer the same pink color at all. should I be worried? and no I'm not pregnant and not going through menopause which may explain it according to websites I've read but I'm worried because some websites are saying any changes in the appearance of your breast could be due to breast cancer. I don't totally remember it, but my grandmother had breast cancer (but she died of lung cancer) and I don't know the probability of me also getting it.
You don't mention your age and that could be relevant. Also taking birth control could be relevant. If, as I suspect, you are a young adult (18 -25) this is probably a sign of you maturing. Some women even find the shade of their nipple colour c u anges at different times through their menstrual cycle. Hormones! If concerned, see a doctor.
I guess you are around 17 years old? A change in hormons can change the colour of nipples and nothing to worry about
This is total imagination and not any kind of symptom of b. cancer I've seen.
Put makeup
Yeah. I'm not supposed to tell you this, but there is a safe with bottle full of pills. Taking 1 pill can cure cancer permanently. They don't let everybody have it or else the world will be overpopulated.
Of course not. They are there to sell drugs. Cancer cures are blockbusters.
Still no cure for cancer.
1. No.
I'm more concerned about who hid the cure for your bad engrish.
THERE HAS BEEN A CURE FOR CANCER BUT SURGEONS ONCOLOGISTS AS ND PHRAMA SHUT IT DOWN. THIS IS WHY I REFUSE TOGIVE TO CURE FOR CANCER. HOWEVER I WILL GIVE TO HELPING PEOPLE LIVING WITH CANCER

You're against fat shaming? What do you think you're doing? You're judging them based off of their appearance without knowing anything about them. You have no idea what they have gone through or what type of health problems they are dealing with. Where is your respect and love for others?
Some of them eat for emotional reasons, some have metabolic or hormone disorders...some have meds that cause weight gain and some just love food and don't care about being fat.
I really don't think it is any of your business. Your writing skills need a lot of work why don't you work on the things you can control rather than the things you can't control.
What is obeased?
They love food.
For about 2 weeks now, every day for about an hour and a half, I get an extreme urge to pee but when I try to, there s nothing. I ve been to the doctor and the UTI and all STD tests came back negative. They diagnosed me with a yeast infection and I took the medication that treated it but that didn t fix the chronic urge to urinate. If it s not a UTI or an STD, what could it be? By the way- I am a generally healthy 18 year old girl.
Check for diabetes. That can lead to frequent urination and excessive thirst.
Call your doctor. Report that the urge to urinate has not subsided.
It sounds like one of the standard early indicators of diabetes.
If you are over stress ; yes it will make you pee often and if you are not stress ;; it can be a sign of diabeties
OK so today I went commando with just jeans on for class. I got really horny, and it got to a few points where it left the "sticky spots" where my penis was. Later I got so horny I had to "tickle the pickle" and ejaculate, and so I calmed down. However, even though I wiped it all off, my penis later conjured up a little more leftover ejaculate stuff and left a few spots. Are my jeans ruined now?
no their not and just wash them
No. Wash them.
I would not recommend this to you at all. You could get caught and get in A LOT of trouble. It would be also humiliating if you got caught. And yes, it is very wrong to masturbate in class
Yes
Considering you're a female, neither are wrong at any time in any place. Have fun.
Yes, of course.
OFF COURSE it is... Go somewhere private
Yes, you should be paying attention. < M

I am very insecure about my penis, I've always wanted it to be longer, it's just around average, I'm 16 btw. I'm a grower not a shower as I'm like 2 inches flaccid and around 4.5 or 5 inches erect. I do have a little bit of a fat pad that hides between a quarter or half an inch of my dick. Which I have no clue how I'm going to get rid of. Any exercises or something I could do to make my flaccid length longer and/or maybe even my erect lenght. Serious answers only please.
Almost anything you do to effect your flaccid penis will effect your erect penis. Circulation is probably not a problem but if you want you could try taking something like Ginkgo Bilbao or even Male Response for a temporary effect in hang. You might try some mild jelling to increase blood flow on a more permanent basis. ebon00 hits a good point about stretches but they will effect erect length too as will jelling. A side effect most people would be fairly happy with. The good news is that people who PE often see a lower expansion ratio between flaccid and erect, ie you turn into more of a shower than a grower.
Getting rid of your fat pad is a simple as changing your lifestyle.... You have to eat healthy comma fresh fruits and vegetables... And exercise daily. If you're lazy and do nothing but sit at home and play video games and eat junk food... You'll never lose your fat pad. And there is no way that you can increase your penis size. That is genetically predetermined for you.
Cardio helps lose fat everywhere. There are no specific exercises that will help with that other than cardio and watching what you eat. IF your not a lumberjack don't eat like one. As far as in the locker room etc. just fluff yourself before taking off your shorts by giving your cock a good squeeze and tug which will make it plump and look bigger to anyone who sees it.
here the thing if you have your penis out for a sex partner - it should already be growing if you have you penis out in like a locker room do you really want them looking at it? and why should it matter what they think as long as you make your partner happy no you can't change your penis size soft or hard and really as a fellow grower some girls really like to watch and help it grow to full size
No muscles in the penis so can't exercise it. But start walking or running and build up to about 5 miles a day, and you'll burn off excess fat fairly quickly.
The only way to lose the fat pad is to have a good diet (no sugar, no sodas, low in carbohydrates. Most of it should be vegetables, fruits, and lean meats). Daily aerobic exercise helps, but the diet is what does 90% of the trick.

Hello, you might want to seek help and explain your problems to a professional. You seem to have some pretty strong anxiety issues. Not getting this checked on can seriously disadvantage you in life, so seeking out help is the number one thing you should be doing now. If you are physically and mentally unable to do it yourself, get your family to force you into it. No matter how hard it may seem, it needs to be done and you need to understand that if you are going to make a difference. Good luck.
Mental disorder. How can your behavior be NORMAL when people actively go to school, to work, go out jogging, to the park, for enjoyment?

Most advertised penis enlargement medicines are ineffective, and some can cause permanent damage to your penis. Pills and lotions usually contain vitamins, minerals, herbs or hormones that manufacturers claim enlarge the penis. None of these products has been proved to work, and some may be harmful.
There is no "medicine' that exists that increases penis size. Lots of fake products for sale though.
Meds don't work. Try penile enlargement surgery
No. None of the things you can buy do anything. The only way is surgery.
lol that **** is a scam bro. if u got a tiny dick try jelqing
I'm wondering if I just have a flu or a bug, but my symptoms have been persistent for about a month and have been progressively worsening. I'm on an anxiety medication if that helps. I just don't want to see a doctor for no reason. Thanks, here are the symptoms Tiredness Disassociation of mind to body Dizziness Shortness of breath Nausea Chills /Hot flashes Headaches Problems falling asleep Problems staying asleep Problems staying awake during the day Low grade fever
I take Lexapro for anxiety but if you don;t take it you can experience these symptoms know as Withdrawl or your body is adjusting to the meds but It could be any of these but don't worry it really could just be a cold or the flu but just in case (I highly don't think it is any of these) Dehydration Panic Attack Hepatitis A,B or C Mumps Iron Poisoning Low Blood Sugar Peptic Ulcer Hay Fever Constipation Underweight Lung Cancer Drug Allergy Rectal Cancer Pancreatic Cancer Gallstones TB Depression and a lot more.... See these symptoms ar quite broad it really could be anything
You should see a doctor. Persistent unexplained symptoms over time are a reason to see a doctor.
The fact you are already on anxiety medication may mean you are worrying about nothing (you are clearly generally a worrier). However in my experience If you feel ill then the longer you leave it before seeking medical help the less chance there is for the professionals to help. Early intervention and diagnosis is always preferable to chasing an already deep seated problem.
Oh, for heaven's sake -- go see a doctor. You have too many symptoms for anybody here to attempt to guess what is wrong with you.
Yes you should, but do medical tests like a magnetic resonance imaging of the whole body
It's quite possible. Strep is very contagious, and I've gotten it that way before. However, there is a slim chance you won't, so only time will tell.
there's a good chance you will, but you may not.

What does it say on the lower receiver? If it is labeled 223 and not 5.56, then no. Too much chamber pressure. It would work but you would be hurting your sporting rifle.
If it says .556 on the barrel, you can shoot that AND .223 ammo. If its says .223, you are restricted to .223 ONLY.
5.56mm NATO is a military grade cartridge- I would not fire in a rifle only rated for .223 remington -probably too hot for a hunting rifle
It's not 5.56 season.
Yes but 1st let me get an insurance policy on you before you go play on the swings
.223 caliber is 5.56mm. Whether is is suited to that particular gun, I would check with the manufacturer.
No rated for a different chamber pressure.
Not recommended
The body normally flucuates +-2 pounds in a day normally. The reason you are not losing weight is because you are eating too little (i know it doesn't make sense, but it's true. I'll explain). When you eat too little, your body naturally assumes less food is available, so it stores EVERYTHING it can from the food it gets. This means you don't lose weight. To lose weight, you need to eat 3 healthy meals a day, and at least 1 healthy snack in between, and drink lots of water.
if you put stuff in and don't pee and poop it out just the stuff in your abdomen can vary by about 3 pounds from day to day also eating one meal is not a good idea, body goes into starvation mode and makes as much fat as it can, eat the same number of calories in 3-6 meals spaced throughout your waking time of day and you will loose faster
You need to eat 4 or 5 really small meals a day. Only eating one slowes down your metabolism and that's why you're not losing weight.
Your body weight fluctuates 1-3 lbs daily anyway.
You should only weigh yourself once per week, your weight fluctuates from day to day so weighing yourself each day is very stressful.
Goodmorning, Yes its healthy if you eat healthy, and probably it will take you 2 months to notice fat if you eat 3000kcal a day fast food and unhealthy food can make you grow slower, try to eat healthy all the time, also before you sleep eat fat food..hopefully this helps..have a good day❤️❤️ and goodluck
Your body isn't used to having the excess calories and probably will store it away as fat. Try maybe building muscle instead! Good luck ♡
None. Diet pills are a waste of money and can actually harm you. There is little to no real regulation and most of them are scams. If you read the fine print, most of them will say something like "with a diet and exercise program.' So why waste money that can be downright dangerous to your health when a decent eating plan and moderate exercise will do a better job?

If you are young, this pain doesn't last forever. I don't know how old you are, but if you are living with your parents, I would suggest getting a job to fill up some of your free time, while saving money. Young people tend to overthink and feel like their lives are coming to an end. Things get better as you get older and you are able to make your own decisions. Please don't lose hope. And please seek help whether it's with a counselor or one at school.

I m an 18 year old girl about 5 4 and 170ish lbs. I ve been trying to lose weight and it s really hard because I never am full. No matter what I eat I just can t seem to fill up my stomach. I m pretty active, I play softball & go to the gym. I know how much I should be eating but it s so hard because food is all I can think about when my stomach is always growling. What do I do???
Hi. I'm a 16 years old girl and I have the same problem. I'm always hungry and keep eating snacks (they never make me full). I could not help eating so I told my mom not to buy much food. If I don't have food at home I won't eat. And only snacks I eat are Chex mix. Those are healthier than other kinds of snacks like chocolates.
Eat small meals every 2-3 hours so your metabolism is constantly moving. Feel free to snack all day on healthy things like fruit, yogurt, veggies, nuts, trail mix, etc so you are not hungry all the time. Keep busy and active doing things you enjoy so you are not always thinking about food.
If you've dieted and lost before, it might be extra hard for you to lose weight. The body wants to regain. Overindulging makes it worse. Probably, you'd need to eat less and figure a strategy to keep hunger at bay. Instead of raiding the fridge for carbs, have crunchy fruits and vegetables. Have boiled chicken.
Is it possible that you are using food for comfort? It is very common and the way out is to get to the source of the problem.
You can't get rid of ADHD. Some people say it's just an excuse. While ADHD is a real thing - if your ready and able, you should treat it as just an excuse. Don't take any medication for it unless you become violent (I've met one guy that did). Your teachers and/or parents will probably recommend/tell you to take it if it helps you study - but no one with ADHD "needs" pills to help them study - so don't do it. Other than that do things to help your focus like; Proper exercise - Stronglifts.com Healthy diet - don't count calories, just try to eat natural, unprocessed and preferably unpackaged food and try to drink mostly water.
ADHD can be treated with medication and maybe some counseling, but it cannot be cured. Go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
With out knowing any signs or symptoms you're having we can't tell you. If you think you have one then see a doctor and get tested for stds.
Do you have an STI? do you engage in unsafe vaginal or anal sex without condoms, with persons who have frequent unsafe sex with many different sexual partners? If NO then you can't have an STI, if sometimes you do, do you have a green/yellow discharge from your penis or vagina? then go to a dr or sexual health clinic for tests and treatment.
Dry fùck yourself
Yes hang yourself
Stick a photo up and we'll tell you.

are you sugar lips?
You're paranoid. You've had a "morning-after" bleed and 3 menstrual periods, and at least 2 negative pregnancy tests after you had sex. You're NOT pregnant! You had sex in December. If you had gotten pregnant at that time, you would be approaching your 6th month of pregnancy, and you would KNOW you were pregnant. If nothing else, you could look at the size of your belly and know.
Paranoid. This pill can cause irregular periods for some months after taking it. Heartburn is due to what you have been eating not being pregnant. This symptom only comes in the last trimester.
paranoid. if you have had periods, there's no way you could be pregnant since your uterine lining is being shed so no embryo can implant on it. periods can be weird, due to many factors like stress and hormones. if having unprotected sex makes you this paranoid, always use protection or just stay away from sex until you're ready.
No, you are not pregnant,you are a bit paranoid,always have protected sex, far less to worry about then!
If your're from that far in the future, why are you asking here? Your local Wisdom Orb can help you better than we can. If not, you should calm down. Getting pregnant without sex is just not possible.
youre pregnant
I'll tell the surveillance team to be a bit more discreet until you've calmed down a bit
well your not paranoid your growing up
Alright so, literally 30 minutes ago I had an 'episode' and I don't know if it's worth looking into professionally or whether it's normal because I keep having these episodes 5 to 10 times a week. But anyway, I all of a sudden go EXTREMELY happy for no apparent reason, I then start to shake and feel really anxious and paranoid and start seeing things (this instance was I saw a child crying on the stairs with his eyes bleeding), that all lasts for about 2 hours which at the end of said episode I begin to feel really nauseous and flustered. Is there any explanation behind these symptoms?
◔̯◔ It's normal for some people to have very active imaginations like you do.
Well its not normal and would be a real problem if you were driving when it happens
This could be serious. Go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
Yes
Nope, I get hungry as hell and start craving pizza and other greasy stuff, but with weed it's the crisps donuts and sodas!!
Just don't drink it's unhealthy and will alter the food choices you decide upon.
Yea a little

NO...it does just the opposite.
Just eat properly. Supplements only add extra cost to a diet and probably don't do anything unless you have been diagnosed with a deficiency.
The Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board recommends that teenage boys between the ages of 14 and 18 consume 11 milligrams of zinc each day. Teenage girls of the same age require 9 milligrams daily. Pregnant and nursing girls between the ages of 14 and 18 respectively require 12 milligrams and 13 milligrams per day. For teenagers, the tolerable upper intake level, or UL, of zinc is 34 milligrams. This means that teens regularly consuming more than 34 milligrams of zinc each day are significantly more likely to experience potentially harmful side effects.
Just not too often until you're older. You can get 50 mg from a big portion of baked clams.
sure, take it every three days
I'm starting to think there is one jerkoff who used to be conservative but is now moving questions just to piss everybody off. Of course there is also the possibility that liberals sick of having their questions moved by question moving jerkoff and doing revenge moving.
There is no way of knowing who moved your question.
I'll keep moving your troll posts until you have finally grasped that we're not feeding into your empty life.
Whoever does it, does it just to annoy you. Are you are being stupid enough to tell them in no uncertain terms that it is working.
LOL I moved your post!
yes
libtards hate free thought.
suck my black veiney ddick mommy
Tell this about principal or just tell it to teacher or other teachers. In every country there is some teachers who picks 1 student who he/she doesnt like and starting bullying them or making extra work and trying to tire them. Propably the best thing would be to say it straight. If you are scared or you cant then you should send her a email.
I guess cyber school isn't so great after all. I recommend finishing your education via correspondence school. No stress, no mean teachers -- plus you graduate early. I loved it!
I would remember I am not a health care professional and not pretend I can "cure" my friend. Encourage your friend to continue to get the help she needs from the right sources.
Once again... there is no such thing as a "split personality disorder". Borderline Personality Disorder maybe.... in which case you walk away. You can't help her.
Know that her mental illnesses are hers. You probably cannot really help her. She needs to do it herself. Tell her you are there to listen if she wants to talk, but know that change will only come from her when she wants it.
do you love her. then you help her by being there. don't offer advise just accept her for who she is .. if you can not then your not a good friend to her. and most likely don't need to be around.
Asking people who have no qualifications and cannot examine you to guess is one idea. I'd see a doctor myself.
Take Ibuprofen asap. If it doesn't improve in a day or so see your doctor as he can prescribe stronger medication.
Walk it off
I think the best thing you can do is to see a doctor
You might needa lose weight...
Bare in mind the person is not suicidal and there mental health is a okay however they would just like to highlight a form of social injustice in the Western World for all to see. Its what they would call the ultimate sacrifice. However they only would do it if the media was watching!!! #selfish lol
Possibly. I am an IVU nurse, so I get to see the dying process pretty frequently.
No I would Not. There are enough stupid shows on TV as it is, this would top them all
Aslong as its teen mom or goardie shore.
Sure why not. Can it be Teen Mom?
Yes
Yes.
You are a Giant compared to many, many creatures , ....here's just a Few . ..🐇🐨🐿🐭🐹 🐠🕊🐧🐸🐝... Too many more to list !.....would you consider yourself a Giant ?
No, you're a human.
I am eighteen years old. Yesterday I woke up with a discomfort in and around my vagina. As the day progressed, it became worse. The more I itched, the more it itched. Yes, I have had sex May 2nd. I also used Nair that day. (not a good idea) The smell from my vagina wasn't there. It smells like nothing. There are no lumps or sores around my private area. There is no smell. (My vagina always had a smell) No discharge. I do not have fevers. I do not have stomach pain. I am not fatigue. immflamation , itch , burn only
It sounds life a yeast infection, but you ought to visit a doctor.
Yeah -- Nair will do it, all right! It will burn the hell out of you! You're going to be sore and raw for several days, all over your genital area.
nair caused a Chemical Burn
sounds like the problem your having is from the product you used to remove the hair down there
sounds like yeast infection or otherwise STD
im a 14 (almost 15) year old girl and i was prescribed 50 mlg of zoloft for my ocd and other stuff a while back, but i tend to not take it every day and skip around with it because i often forget. (unmedicated adhd going into play there) right now i haven't taken it for 3 days and i have a headache and feel kinda loopy/weird, and im guessing it's because i haven't been taking my meds. is it ok that i do this? like, will i be permanently damaged or somehow injured because of this habit?
Well you won't experience physical health issues by not taking it. But you are absolutely diminishing the effectiveness of the drug. Speaking as someone who has ADHD; set a little calendar notification everyday to take your medicine. You might find that your ADHD symptoms become alleviated with the consistency of taking your Zoloft
probably good if you take medication every day.... I know personally if I don't take my antidepressants regularly it doesn't end up good.
It depends. If it is in the best interests of your own mental health, it is okay for me also.
Learn Marshall Arts, But be genital with Daddy.. !!
The 'best answer' is >Marshall< Arts? Huh? , , START NOW and "get over it". You have X-number of days before you turn 18. If you STAY under his roof and Rules after that day YOU LOSE. If you make the 'argument' physical YOU LOSE and so does he to a lesser extent. , , It appears he isn't adjusting to your natural need to Grow as an individual and you RESENT being stifled by his Place in the family. BOTH factors will pass with time. Clench your teeth and tolerate things the best you can until YOU'RE OUT.
My dad died when I was 14 . But he had been sick and away for a long time . But I do have an older brother by 3 years who used to bully his 3 younger brothers . So , one day when he came home from the Navy and started bullying one of my brothers I told him to come out back with me so we could settle this . For , I had been taking wrestling in H.S. . And I immediately put him in a wrestling hold , where he cryed Uncle .
Wait until he's 100 years old.
weightlifting karate physical conditioning no steroids just naturally get bigger and faster my dad beat me mercilessly daily for fun until one day i nearly killed him in a fight still have the scar from where he stabbed me that or seek help from local authorities the police have seen everything and may help you get out of there into a safe environment your choice looking back i wish i had asked for help i 49 and in a lot of pain that could have differant if i had just spoke up good luck be well
You're already strong enough to lift a gun, that would likely work.
I'm sure he tastes his medicine every time he takes it. Did you mean you want to taste your dad's medicine? That's not a good idea.
Chuck Norris kick him in the nuts then do it at least 5 more times in a row to make sure!
What will this physical confrontation accomplish? Be the mature one, and walk away from a fight. Hopefully in time, you guys can have a better relationship.
It's really that people with a lot of belly fat with have greatly distended stomachs which take a lot more filling before they are satiated so they are for ever esurient.
yes,it is true you will feel more hunger than before if you having a lot of belly fat and if you eat more then you will become more fat
Nope. Not in my case, actually I feel LESS hungry.
no it's not
It would be a fairly rare occurrence if it did happen.
Yes, it IS possible, but it isn't guaranteed.
No
no
Stab yourself in the head with a knife,through you eye.your eye is soft and knife will go through it easily. Or jump of high building head first.
Use butane or overdose on ketamine. Either are fun, attempted them both before.

You're probably gaining muscle. I would try to get your mile down to 7 minutes or under as that is a good indicator of cardiovascular health. I had the same thing happen to me and I hit a growth spurt. I was a sophomore at 6ft 185 then junion 215 senior at 225 and I wasn't any fatter just more muscular.
Your body is adjusting to your new athletic actions. You may be gaining muscle capacity before you work off some of the weight you want to lose. Don't worry too much about it unless you start to not lose weight but only gain it. If this happens, you may need to talk to a doctor if it gets out of control.
you could have gain muscle but you could start to eat better, no matter how much excersice you do, if you dont know how to eat you wont loose weight
You are not getting fatter you are just getting more muscles... The fat will probs burn off and just try to eat healthier
Because you're getting muscles!
Hello, I'm 24 years old and I think my beard is JUST coming in now. I can grow a mustache, and a in a month ago, I can grow hair on my chin. I can see a lot of very thin white white hairs on my cheeks but they never seem to grow past that. Is there something I can do to kind of "wake it up". I've looked online and have read that shaving to induce growth is just a myth. Is there something I can do to actually make it work??
You're a 24 year old grown man... And you are actually asking how you can make your beard grow faster or thicker......? And no.... shaving does not make a beard grow faster. It does absolutely nothing. The hair follicles produce exact same volume of hair regardless if it's shaved or left alone.
No, no way to make whiskers grow. You may gradually grow more though at your age that is less likely. May just not have full beard growth- 50% of all guys don t
I used to take vitamin E for my hair (I had long hair in college) because I heard it helps your hair and nails grow faster, so you can try that. Also, this might be an old story our dads taught us as kids, but I remember hearing that when you shave, your beard will come in fuller (maybe also faster, don't know).
That's the dumbest thing I've heard ALL WEEK !!! It's SO BAD that I don't even have a snappy come-back for it !!!
Yes that's why people use lettuce
yes
They do use some chemicals to make toilet paper.
nly if you do it with sandpaper soaked in gasoline.
i had to use pine cones at one time-no problem THEY DO SMART :(
No
no it doesn't
No it does NOT.

No, chickens don't know any better. The chicken crossed the road in a bucket after the two black guys caught it
Yes. And they were carrying a fryer and some purple drank. The chicken knew what was going down.
It's because the windshield testers forgot to thaw the chicken before firing it at the air craft windshield.
-Nah... -It was cuz Cornel Sanders was Hot on its Tail !
to show possums it is possible
true
I don't really want a six pack or visible muscle definition but I would like to get a little firmer and a more toned body. I hate strength training, it's boring and it gives me headaches and nausea. However I really love dancing and I regularly started to attend dancing classes (tap dancing, swing, salsa and other modern types). I also dance at home almost every day. I can say that I spend 8 hours a week dancing. Do I have to do strength training too for a toned body or is dancing enough?
Yes-ish. You really do still need to train for your dance in general. If you want to have any extension at all, you'll need to do your developes en croix, and 8-4-2-1-1-1-1 etc which are exercise.
dancing is great, so are the 5 tibetans , and calisthetics, and shadow boxing. get bored with one, move on to another and so on......just dancing by itself til you break a sweat burns off stress, oxygenates your blood and generally contributes to a feeling of well being !!!! so keep it up, and don't forget quality food based vitamins and minerals....
dancing is a wonderful tool for toning because it isolates so many different and alternating muscle groups
it can be.
-Not possible. It takes at least 5 MONTHS to grow an Inch. 2 Weeks is just NOT going to cut it. -Sorry. :(
Stand on a gallon of milk. Boom, you 'grew' a few inches.
Milk doesn't make you taller, nor does anything else. Genes determine your height. Nothing you eat will change your height.
You cannot make yourself grow taller than your genetically programmed to be.
Men stop round16. Women 15. Nothing you can do.
There's no relationship or similarity at all. Lyme disease is caused buy a spirochete bacteria that can cause chronic problems that are similar to rheumatoid arthritis. West Nile virus is a viral infection that can cause mild to severe flu-like symptoms that last a few days. The symptoms you experienced would not occur from Lyme disease, but they are typical of many different types of viral infections.
Anonymous is right. People thumbed down this but its actually true. Both are forms of bio warfare. Its not just a conspiracy theory, its very real and there are very real files you can just google. Also read the book, "Lab 257" and it explains how the US hired Nazi scientists and plopped them down on Plum Island right off the coast of "Lyme" Ct. When the ticks they were experimenting with got back to the coast riding in on deer and birds, it infected "Lyme Ct" thus giving Lyme Disease it's name. As for the original questions Bob is right.. no relationship at all.
lyme ( borellia bergdorfii ) was developed by an EX Nazi at the CDC biolab on plum island NY . west nile like virus was a developed by the Iraqis and delivered to the US in 2001 .
Try eating leaner meats. Sausage has a huge amount of fat these days. Try something else like maybe slices of lean ham. Add some fruits and veggies too; you really need them. Find some that you like, maybe coleslaw, corn, strawberries, apples? Or whatever you like if its healthy.
YOur diet is not so great. I would pick up a good basic nutrition book. You need fish, chicken, grains (not white rice), vegies, less potato.
You should talk to your doctor, since there are other factors besides diet.
My school will start after 1 week so i decided to masturbate 5 times today so that i will not be masturbating during classes days and i will be more focus on my studies but just right after 1 c*m i regret everything I've done and feel digusted with myself so my supposed to be 5 c*m today become 1. I do not know if I'm being normal because i never heard about it before, do i have mental disorders? Do y'all experience it as well? What?? Please helpppppppppl
many guys get that "regret" or embarrassment feeling following masturbation, likely just because in many it is ingrained that masturbation is "bad" or "wrong" but the urge is strong so you do it. Nothing wrong with masturbation of course, and over time you get over that regret feeling once you accept solo sex is normal and natural. But 5 times in one day is a bit much. For school, if really horny may want to do it when you wake up or in the shower before school, and then maybe the night when you go to bed.
Dont overdo your masturbation although its normal you can also have nasturbation and c.um after class or before going to bed... Your normal bro, i do sometimes regret coz instead of studying i watch porn and masturbate... What isnt normal is if your social life is being ruined by masturbating alot.
There is nothing wrong with masturbating. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
You are very normal kid. You have no mental disorder. Try to distract your mind from this act and play outdoors. Dont stay alone. Give rest to your weapon. You are great.
no. you get fat by eating too much food. Normal people eat 2500 to 3000 calories a day (young people) so if you eat 4000 calories a day you will gain weight. You could literally just spoon sugar into your mouth until you reach 2500 calories and then stop - and you wouldn't gain weight. You might get diabetes and die of kidney failure tho.
Yes, you would get fat by eating sugar but, if you run or maybe Evan jog it will burn some calories for you.
Not necessarily. However, you might become diabetic in the long run if you eat too much of it. If you had to choose between a fatty food and a sweet one, go with the fatty one. "Why eatin' fat doesn't make you fat" http://www.realfoodhouston.com/wp-files/why-eating-fat-doesnt-make-you-fat/
Not really, but you risk of sugar-rushes and high blood pressure.

Hi James, seems to me that you are ashamed to have diabetes, which is why you feel lower than everyone else ie abnormal, but having type 1 diabetes means that your pancras is no longer working ie not producing insuline and that has nothing to do with bad living or a reflection on a person. There is absolutely no need to feel shame and well, how do you know that the person who you feel inferior to is not battling the same issue or something even worse like aids? Does not make you a weak person. What would make you weak is if you succumb to those negative feelings and do not control your diabetes.
Hon, your problem doesn't sound like diabetes. A lot of type 1 diabetics socialize and take their meds, they take their condition in stride and it doesn't stop them from enjoying life. Diabetics who manage their disease have a life span that is comparable to non-diabetics. You sound like a lot of other teens who struggle who don't have diabetes... depression, trouble socializing, feeling isolated and misunderstood, etc. These things are something a lot of teens struggle with, no diabetes necessary. Have you tried joining something you're passionate about? Maybe outside of school even (music lessons, volunteering, etc.)? When you indulge in your passions, you tend to find like-minded people.
What IS 'normal'? Everybody has something they have to cope with in life. I urge you to talk to your Diabetic team for starters, then your parents, teachers, GP - in other words there is help out there and please look for it instead of getting so low that you try to kill yourself. As far as your diabetes is concerned, it's sad you have to deal with it of course, but people live long and fulfilled lives, despite being diabetic. Be thankful that you live in an age where this can be controlled. Wasn't always the case.
Not normally, no. There is a "valve" that locks out the bladder when one has an erection making you unable to urinate. So you'd be unable to pee whilst ejaculating. However, you can urinate when semi-erect since this valve wouldn't be entirely shut. It is also certainly possible for a person to have a defect that prevents normal operation allowing urine to leak out when aroused or during an ejaculation, but this wouldn't be actual peeing.
Not normally. When a male is at full erection, the prostate will shut off access to the lower urethra by the bladder-- so no urine can mix and contaminate the semen. So guys can't generally pee until the erection subsides slightly. And during ejaculation the urethra is certainly closed off to the bladder so no urine should be there.
No. Urethra shuts down while your ejaculating to prevent pee from flowing because of sensation.
No. The prostate swells and kinks off the urethra.
Nope.
Nope, not possible for any normal male
Generally no.
People say no, but anything is possible if you put your mind to it

They can do that because they are very focused and are willing to do what is necessary to be successful. They are willing to work hard and make sacrifices. Short term pain for long term gain.
Time management. Making a schedule also helps.
A combination of time management, natural smarts, and probably a lot of caffeine
Please attend a Refresher Course for three months.in any of the Tutorial Colleges in your town. The fees are moderate and timings flexible. It covers all the subjects that you need during adolescent stage of life. The title of the course is "Do, Did, Done". It will make you conversant and familiar with everything. I appreciate your best efforts to grab this answer without raising a solid question.
Go slow and easy, and focus on your own sensations, and don't watch porn while doing the deed. OK to watch before you start but takes away from your focus.
Sit under the water tap in bath room . let the water flow in full speed over your cock .(Adjust speed if it hurts). The cock will get erect and the semen will ooze out . You will enjoy like any thing. Regards.
Faap while watching porn. Thatll give you much pleasure just be careful coz its addicting.

pre period. wear panty liners until is goes away.
sounds like a period too me but i would still ask your mom
yes it probably is. had the same experience :)
Okay...it might sound ridiculous but hear me out cause I'd like a serious answer. So...like most (I hope) boys I have a masturbation habit. I do it under my clothes so I won't get busted. The thing is...I've notticed that while the hair of my abdomen are straight, the parts my sperm stays on became curly. I haven't tested the theory spreading sperm on other hairy parts of me (cause that would be gross) but my abdomen hair are straight except from the areas where my sperm stays on. So I wonder if the reason they became curly is sperm. Does anyone has any similar experiences?
I don't remember experiencing what you have. Because I've shaved or trimmed my pubic hair for a long time now. Water and liquids (chemicals) can make straight hair curly or wavey. But it is only temporary. Maybe this is what you are describing. My hair used to get curly or kinky (frizzy) when wet. Then my hair straightened when it dried.
Yes. As you ask in the end of your narration, my uncle does similar dramas in our house. We are used to it because he is a serious schizo patient. Initially for a feet or so, the growth of hair will be straight. Afterwards, it may become curly, if you have implicit faith, unshakable belief and unflinching devotion towards your Mentor and if you strictly follow the instructions, systems and procedures meticulously. Moreover, if you don't unsettle your mind, you may not get confused like this.
Semen, not sperm. Guys ejaculate seminal fluid, which contains about 2% sperm by volume. But no, semen does not make hair curly. Pubes tend to be naturally curly. I would not tell anyone you ejaculate in your pants, as most guys cannot fit their erections in their pants -- too big, dude.
No. Sperm is a microorganism used for fertilizing the female egg for the sake of pregnancy. It has nothing to do with someone's hair growth.
Yes
I left a tampon in for around7.5hours. I had to stay in during lunch at school to talk to my teacher, and that's when I change my tampon. I completely forgot and didn't change it for around 7.5h. I read all the symptoms and I don't have any except I did have pain in my sides which went away, and feeling a little dizzy which I usually feel if I'm nervous. I do have a light flow but I always have leakage so i used a "light" tampon with panty liners.
The recommendation in the UK is that you can leave a tampon in safely for up to 8 hours. Even if you accidentally go over this, TSS is an extremely rare condition, but seeing as it is largely associated with tampon use they are required to warn people. Doesn't mean its likely to ever happen to you. You are almost certainly going to be absolutely fine, the symptoms you have are due to your period. If you had TSS, you'd be toxic and extremely sick. Best wishes.
In the UK we normally leave a tampon in overnight for 8 hours. There seems to be Neurosis about this in the US. We all have the same bodies. TSS is incredibly rare. Why have the English girls not died of it ?
tss is very rare, usually people that get it from leaving a tampon in too long leave it in much longer than you, sometimes days. keep an eye on yourself just in case, but since you don't have most of the symptoms, i don't think you have it. pain in your side and dizziness can be caused by other things.
Fluorides highly reactive nature makes it a relatively dangerous substance in general. Ingesting more than small amounts will damage your bones and internal organs. Fluoride poisoning risk is why toothpaste and mouth rinses containing it are not recommended for young children or carry warning labels to that effect. It has been shown small amounts of fluoride exposure, especially topical to the teeth, can improve the acid resistance of the teeth thus reducing tooth decay somewhat.

The fact that it is in our water proves it has been found to be good for us.
It can help tremendously, but only because of the caffeine. If you prefer another type of caffeinated drink then any will do. Some pain relievers contain caffeine, too.
In some cases, yes!

You should have had a 504 plan in place lone ago. First, tell your teacher simply what you have said here "it hurts terribly and gives me really bad anxiety" The important thing is to have your parents follow up with the teacher and explain the health situation. If you have not seen a doctor, you certainly should. If this is something that has been occurring for a long time, you need to have it on record and the school can the responds accordingly. Simply having a student say "I have panic attacks so I can't run" sounds like an excuse that the teacher has probably heard similar excuses hundreds of times. True medical need, should be addressed immediately.
Tell teacher you need to opt out of gym class, if that's what you are talking about. You will probably need a doctor's note and it should be put in your school record for future.
Let your teachers know that you have panic attacks occasionally, so that if one occurs when your at school, your able to go to the school nurse, have some time alone, or even go home if needed. Hope I helped ;)
see a counselor, therapist.
It is depression.Consider why she might feel depressed. Sometimes depression is a symptom of something circumstantial in her life. Is she feeling spiritually disconnected or sexually restless? Is she suffering from creative blocks? Is her body failing ? Is she facing financial ruin? Let her be honest with herself about what might be off-kilter in her life, and make an effort to get to the root of why she might be feeling depressed. Always you be around so that she pay attention to you & not talk to herself.
No, that is completely and totally normal. Don't you ever replay a conversation in your head? Of anticipate an upcoming conversation in your head? Or have a pretend conversation in your head? So she does it out loud.... it is no more abnormal then thinking it in your head.
Yes, don't suppress the diarrhea, which is the way for the body to expel the bad stuff. Never, never do this again, nor ask anyone else to do it. It is extremely dangerous. Make sure you drink extra water to make up for the lost fluids owing to diarrhea. You are not thinking clearly if you are worried about your birthday. Your body and your health should be your primary concern.
Quite likely. Drink lots of fluids and eat easy to digest food until it, um, passes. If you start feeling like you have a fever or notice blood when you go, call a doctor or go to urgent care
over 40 % of all factory raised chicken has salmonella . chicken and beef are loaded with pathogens - listeria , E coli , ptomaine , cryptosporidium , campylobateria , etc .
Lately, I haven't had enough money to afford food, and I'm not sure how long it will be til I get more money. I've been stretching the food I have, and this should be temporary, but I've been eating between 500 and 1000 calories a day. Is it a bad idea to drink the sugary drinks to account for missing calories, since it's all I have? I'm used to eating about 2500 calories a day since I go to the gym and weigh about 180.
If you haven't bought the Lipton tea yet, then use that money to buy some real food, like beans for example. If you've already bought the stuff and can't return it, then don't waste it and drink it up; even so-called 'empty calories' will help you, if you're going to be stuck on a forced 500-1000 calories diet. Don't worry too much about the undereating though, just treat it like a period of fasting, it's not going to kill you when you go hungry for a period.
If you have no money and no food then drink the tea if that's all you have in the cupboard, but be aware they are empty calories and won't sustain you for long, do you have a food kitchen In Your area, they will supply hot food, look on google to find closest place that will feed you for free! I hope you get back on your feet soon and don't be worried about using these places I know people who work full time and eat there a couple of times a week to make ends meet
It's not just about the calories. Sugary tea won't give you the vitamins, protein, minerals or anything else important your body needs. If this goes on too long you might lose muscle mass and become deficient in something. Could you for example eat at a friend or some family member at least once a day or ask them to borrow you a bit of money until you get a better source of income? Does your home are have a system that gives financial support to people with low income?
I'd say use that money you use for the tea and buy some beans, rice or noodles. Drink water instead of tea. Beans rice and noodles are quite cheap at most places like a discount food store.
Those are empty calories and a terrible waste of money. Why do you buy them in the first place? I drink tap water and make my own black coffee and iced tea(from tea bags and boiling water). The stuff you think is going to substitute for food is only going to delay starvation for a short time. Your body will start destroying itself in a effort to continue functioning. You can look for a soup kitchen or charity food cupboard in your area and pick up enough to avoid having to make do with sugar water.
Yeah because there's no real heavy nutrients, and it isn't solid enough you might as well drink a Naked smoothie drink if you're going to attempt drinking heathy calories
Yaybe you read the ingredients of Lipton's peach tea and notice how much crap they put in it. Compare it to better quality products.
If sugary drinks are all you have then that is fine, so long as you don't get a vitamin deficiency which is quite hard to do. If you can try to apply for food stamps. the important thing is that you don't starve.
U might have worms crawling up ur butthole
Lmao
maybe pinworms, try eat raw garlic, alternated with eating a meal. garlic likely kill pinworm. allicin inside garlic is antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal source : 'antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiprotozoal activity.[6] Allicin is garlic's defense mechanism against attacks by pests.[7]' in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allicin
Could be you have parasites. Some say 60% of the population does.
Either a yeast infection or hemorrhoids.
may be
Could easily be pinworms....
cus they are
Labia help to protect the delicate areas of the vulva such as the head of the clitoris, also the vaginal opening and the urethral opening within the vestibule of the vulva, protecting from friction due to contact with underwear or dirt. Labia are also stimulated during sex, labia minora will swell during arousal and become more sensitive but also during penetrative sex the penis/fingers/toys stimulating the labia minor can also in turn stimulate the head of the clitoris.
That structural design allows for better expansion of the orifice. Labia on the mouth allow for speech and make eating much easier. Labia on the vulva allow for copulation and childbirth.
For extra stimulation for the woman. I mean, if sex wasn't enjoyable then the human race would have been extinct.
To protect your external genitals.
The stuff works. it's no miracle pill. You still have to do the other 90% of the hard work for this to have much effect.. But I like it because it's not so extreme on the body like other Fat Burners. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea gives me a clean energy boost when I need it, helps suppress my appetite, and gives me those extra deep cuts that I need for my modeling profession
The safest would be phentermine/adipex that you can get from your doctor. They only prescribe if for 3 months then a 6 month break but it works really well
Dont waste your time or money they dont work as I have tried them all over past 30 years, healthy eating and exercise done it for me and i lost 28lbs, Good Luck
No. All "fat burners" are just "cash burners".
You sound depressed. You also sound like you have a fair amount of awareness around what's going on. I would speak with a psychologist or therapist to learn some better coping strategies. Also, there's a lot of lonely people out there, you're definitely not the only one.
listen. Life is way to short to let depression take you over. You are a person wth e life on this earth and I up to you to choose how you live it. So whatever is making you unhappy, cut it out of your life and don't do it. Find something that make you happy and let NO one take it away from you. music helps me feel something, Im in the same boat as you but im younger. Keep writing music. I know you lost interest in it but it helps so much. Listen to Bring me the Horizon. They help me a lot.
What did you think the medication was for, Genius? If whatever you were given didn't work, go back and tell th doctor so you can try something else. Finding the right SSRI with the best balance of benefit : side effect is usually a lot of trial and error. This is largely due to the fact that no one responds to a certain SSRI the same. What do you want, pity? Sorry, fresh out of pity for those in need who refuse the help they're given.
What you describe is depression. Go back to the counselor and make a plan to move your life forward.
Hgh won't do anything at this point. There's very little growth left after 15. Hgh works when taking before your growth spurts
From a biological standpoint, you might still be growing! Ladies stop growing around 18 years old, and guys stop growing around ~24 years old. You might need to just give your body a chance to keep growing. Keep eating healthy foods and stay active!
You don't have to listen to me but, I'll tell ya now... Listed to your doctor or you will regret it later in life, if can become a lifestyle type thing. Just be smart!
At 15, you've likely stopped growing.
And I know some people who knewly took this who was taller than me on my age
No, as it must be prescribed by a doctor, and no doctor is going to prescribe it.
Are you male or female? Don't try to destroy yourself.
Whole grain foods, fruits and veggies. Some more than others. For example celery is very high in fiber but cucumbers have less. Once grains are processed they are pretty much stripped of their fiber. You want whole, unprocessed grain in your bread. Oatmeal is a great source. Flax seed and chia seeds are also great sources of fiber. I keep them around and put a Tbls or two into most dishes that I make. That much isn't noticable in taste but it continually adds to our fiber intake.
Pretty much all fruits and vegetables Ezekiel bread Oats Beans Nuts Basically, plant foods
Cauliflower & Broccoli
Whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, pears, sweet potatoes.
Im going to be visiting family and its a 24 hour trip. I wanted to know if I eat less calories the day before lets say 600 and I eat the rest and the daily calories intake the day of the trip will my weight maintain. Its because I usually eat around 2300 calories a day and burn off 500 so I won't gain weight but being im going to be in a car.
You eat enough to keep from becoming fatugued while driving. Plus hydrate. Pack a cooler with water and homemade sandwiches. No one counts calories while driving. Even if you were to gain a lb, you could lose it in a day.
Holy fack.. you don't have clue, do you? Your body burns calories all day, every day. A person DOES NOT gain weight by sitting in a car..... you gain weight when you CONTINUOUSLY consume more calories than you burn. The fact that you think you can gain weight by riding in a car is ridiculous.
You have serious body issues that need looking at. Don't you know that you can go days without diet and workout, and your body will maintain the same as you've been maintaining? Stop counting calories, and relax.
No it does not always come down to your parents being strict, it comes down to how you were brought up, experiences you've been through and genetics, just a mix of all of them
Probably. How old are you? Do you still live at home? My advice would be to move out and away from them if possible. Once you are on your own, the anxiety should lesson.
One of my psychology professors summed up early life for me in this sentence: "We are the sum of our experiences". In short, we learn how to respond to situations right from the beginning. However, most of us with strict parents easily outgrown our dependency on their approval of what we do in adolescence.....we don't need their approval. We're healthy.
yes
More about it the nail is still on in 1 price but half is still completely on but the other half is falling off
no way....use liquid bandage, it will sting.....let it air dry.....use loose gauze to hold nail in place, remove gauze at night....nail needs to fall off....don't force it off....bandaids do not allow for good healing, it needs air
Go to an urgent care clinic and have them look at it..
no seek medical attention asap
Yes, there is a moderate interaction. Gabapentin can enhance the adverse side effects of the Celexa. There is an increased risk of psychomotor impairment. Exercise caution when operating machinery and vehicles until you are sure how the medication affects you. I don't know the exact reason for you taking the medications and I do not want to assume. However, consult with your prescriber and pharmacist who are monitoring your therapy. If anything, you will have to start on the lowest possible dose of gabapentin and titrate to a tolerable dose.
Don't mix dietary supplements with medicine without first consulting a Dr.
I do now. I lived with my father who was an abusive alcoholic and blamed a lot of my behaviour on him until I gave myself a kick up the backside and realised that he was an addict and I had to take responsibility for my own actions. My future is in my hands and I'm doing alright, I make mistakes every now and then but these are small mistakes and I own them as my own. I have an awesome job and have done things I never thought I would but I wouldn't have done any of this if I didn't give myself a kick up the backside because its so easy to blame others for my own misgivings!
I do. Like being in the calm eye of a violent hurricane surrounding me, thanks to Jesus! Jhn 14:27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Jhn 16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. Phl 4:7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.

A 5' 4" teenage girl should weigh around 65 pounds. Ideal weight, 55 pounds.
Height Ideal Body Weight 5' 4" 108 - 132 lbs. it varies depends on how thin you want to be but this is a normal healthy weight for your height.
I'm 5'5 and a doctor told me my healthy weight boundary is between 50-65 kg :)
I think "robert" got his weight system wrong, 50 KG is around 110 pounds, so about 110-150 pounds is Healthy (assuming what bonnie said is true)
The target weight for a 5`4`` female is 125lbs (plus or minus 10lbs).
the ideal weight of a 5'4" tall lady is 117lbs (equal to 53kilogramm). the normal "healthy" weight of a 5'4" tall lady is 138lbs (equal to 63 kg).
Hey man, I'm 16 too, now, I can't really relate to you, but I'll try to help you get your shít in order. Masturbation doesn't cause weak bones, if it did then every teen would be constantly breaking bones, smoking can change your voice, and I don't suspect you could change it back. You skin looks like that because puberty, bro. Give it a few years, things will change.
Masturbation is just solo sex-- guys are designed to have sex so no side effects. Sounds like you need to quit smoking- probably causing the skin disorder (though acne is common in puberty) and start exercising and getting in shape to improve your health. Just walking daily can do that.

It's called a maternal-request c-section. And the only way to find out if you can get one is to ask your doctor. Some of them are totally chill with it, some of them are not. C-section deliveries without a clear medical reason *are* more dangerous to you than normal deliveries. If you're planning on having a large family (more than three kids) you should make a very serious attempt to avoid caesarian deliveries, since they also increase your risk of dangerous complications in subsequent pregnancies. The method of birth has nothing to do with how well the weight comes off.
not if you dont have a medical reason. your vagina will go back within two months. and its just as hard if not harder to lose baby fat after a c-section, as its difficult to exercise with the longer recuperation time. many women have had children and gone back to their pre pregnancy size. c-sections are riskier then vaginal births, for both the mother and child, so they dont do them unnecessarily.
if there is no medical reason for it, they are not going to do a c-section - that is MAJOR surgery and costs a lot more - plenty of women trim down to pre-pregnancy weight if they actually TRY
In Canada, you schedule it. It's a choice. Not sure in the US, can't see why not. BTW, having a C-section doesn't help you lose the chub.

He should have told you he has HIV before you guys have sex. You should dump him. He put your life at risk. I'm not preaching but don't engage in unsafe sex ever. Oral or intercourse without protection you can't trust people with your life. Anyway it'll be wise to get tested so you'll know for sure and have a peace of mind. See a Dr and tell them exactly what you wrote here and get tested 3 months after exposure and then 6 months and once or twice a year. Please use protection if you can't abstain from sex while getting tested. All the best.
Hi! Thanks for answers. Yes I will definitely get tested, I was just wondering if this behavior was on high or low risk. In the meantime I called the doctor and STD clinic and they both told me the risk is low, but that I should get tested in 3 weeks in order do be 100% sure.
Go to a doctor. Tell him/her this. Get checked. People on here cannot tell you if you've been exposed or not.
go to the doctors! We cant examine you online :I
the cheaper your rent, the more weirdo's you come accross.
You need to find a better class of people. Find some big happy churches, attend some age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Talk with the pastor/minister; where else can you get counseling for free? Put a "roommate wanted" notice on church bulletin boards.
Or maybe you are the weird room mate who refuses to accept that he is a weird person who drives away all the normal people and attracts the strange ones. Look dude, if something happens to you once (or maybe even twice) it can be excused as coincidence. But when something happens repeatedly.. over and over.. all the time... then YOU need to look at how YOU might be contributing to the situation.
Yes, men masturbate whether away or not, whether driving or not, married or not, alone or not. It's the most guilt free feeling of releasing tension. Your BF is a healthy normal being.
Quite normal- I don't know any married guy (or any adult guy for that matter) that I have hung out with that didn't admit to masturbating regularly. Just something guys enjoy doing and certainly if the mate is not available guys will take care of urges by hand. He is not disrespecting you in any way, just relieving sexual tension and horniness.
LOL... he can and will masturbate when he's away, and at home. It doesn't matter. Men masturbate whenever we feel like it. It has nothing to do with anybody else or anything else.
Its normal for guys to masterbate, and homesickness while your away make him more to do it. And it helps him feel relax and calm, im a guy and masturbation has been a part of my life so theres nothing to worry about it. Anyway congratulations on your baby.
it is normal for a man to masturbate whether he "works away" or not
actually it's quite normal if the girlfriend is not around and everybody does it
of course
Exactly the same way he peed before he was castrated. Castration is the removal of the testicles. You know that pee isn't made in the testicles, right? Urine is stored in the bladder (which is inside the body just like in women) and travels down the urethra to the end of the penis.
Castration removes the scrotum and testicles, or just the testicles from inside the scrotum. The penis is generally left intact.
castration is removing balls, not penis.

There are around 200 different diseases called cancer. They have different causes and risk factors. In many cases we cannot identify the cause. Sounds kike you need to do a LOT more research for your project and perhaps narrow it down to a specific type of cancer.
No, infants to the elderly pass of cancer. Your project subjects need to include all groups of people. Bone cancer, blood, pancreatic, many types inclusive of all people. Then there is demography, all groups can get cancer. You need to hit the library as this is one disease the library has microfilm and articles on this horrible disease. Dating back over a century. Best wishes on your paper. You may have selected a topic that is hard not to take personally.
There are lots of risk factors that some cancer has in common, but it varies so much person to person and cancer to cancer.
High fiber reduces risks of colorectal cancers, most colorectal cancers occur in the sigmoid and rectum where fecal material transient times are slow, people on high fiber pass the fecal material quicker thus their incident of rectal cancers are less. Obesity is correlated with endometrial cancers. Smoking of course, oral tobacco products with oral head and neck cancers. Sun exposure of course HIV correlated with Karposi's Sarcoma.
Of course they aren't. Think about breast cancer and ovarian cancer. I suggest you google causes of cancer.
No. Some are familial mutations that predispose individuals to it
I will be finishing my 6 chemo therapy and I am scheduled for my radiation therapy and I have no idea what I will have to prepare for myself. Someone suggested that I use suntan lotion before and after treatment . Is that appropriate ?How serious will my burn be ?Is it necessary to have 6 weeks radiation therapy ? What is the after effect if I do not finish it all.
I got an instruction sheet when I first saw the doctor. I had no burning at all after 16 treatments. It wasn't a big deal for me; I got a little tired but I needed a fifty mile round trip every day to get to the hospital, and I think that did it. If you do not finish, the after effect is that your cancer may return.
My radiation therapy was a piece of cake. Lasted a mere 8 minutes a day. No suntan lotion here. And I burn very easily. I mean BURN. And I didn't burn once during radiation treatment. I may have gotten a light pink "tan" but nothing like a sunburn. Wasn't painful at all, and rarely even used the cream they gave me for dry skin. Yes, it is very necessary to have 6 weeks of radiation. The after effect? A return of your cancer?
The radiation oncology team will let you know what's necessary. I've had 69 radiation sessions to three different parts of my body and I've never burned. I've never used any lotions either. However, that's simply how my body reacts. Talk to your team.
As a nurse epidemiologist, I can say that you don't need suntan lotion... you're not getting the rays that you get a sunburn from. Wear comfy clothes. Afterwards you will feel tired for a few hours. So sorry you have to go through this.
If you have yet to ejaculate, you have not really climaxed. This is a concern, because boys are typically able to ejaculate normally like any other man by the age of Thirteen or so. If this continues, you need to talk to your doctor about it.
Give it some time, maybe your body is not physically able to ejaculate yet.
Likely just not finishing or allowing the climax to build sufficiently to start the release of semen.
you are 14, just that. wait some months again
sexual contact with your self or with others. including but not limited to, oral, intercourse, or other acts. when you see your doctor for a physical, they will ask you this. they ask to make sure to test for sexual diseases or not, or if you're having other issues that aren't normal. it maybe embarrassing to talk about it with your doctor, but they are there to help. it's better to talk with them then your parents about it at least.
Unmarried

Youre very lucky you can do that to yourself. Flesxibility is the real answer to that.
start with a long co ck
just keep practicing
it's a sign, ur gay bro.
You have a nice size. It's like that when you are younger but when you get older you will realize how nice of a body you had. If you want, get a breast reduction but I don't recommend it. Try doing chest exercises like push ups to make your chest a little more muscular (not like a man) but it will reduce your bust size if you were uncomfortable your chest size. Other than that, you sound like you have an awesome body. I have a huge breast size as well, I just learned to love it. Don't be self conscious about it.
Hi who is your computer? No want win 10 afraid of consequences Make update no come I need lawyer
Sigh.......dear, this is your body. There is nothing you can do about changing it. So love yourself, accept yourself, believe that you're beautfiul.
You are lying about something I wonder if you are a girl or a guy . You are anonymous so i guess you are a guy .
I've been using for a month now...recommended by a friend...too early to see significant improvement...texture is a little greasy...probably better for extremely dry skin so I purchased the Argan Rain Ultra Organic Argan Oil Treatment for stretch marks...use this for night.
Not at all. It's natural. I do fel insecure about my small penis. It's only 5 inches.
no you shouldn't and there just a part of getting older
no! they look cool
That's correct. Start a document, and write main goal, subgoals, and steps to achieve them. It's personal as there's no one who comes along, writes goals, sets reminders, heaps praise, and dispenses rewards. For motivation, a desire not to be a burden on loved ones.
No. A routine. Set a dietary and exercise routine and stick to it.
No, you need some will power, self control and awareness.
I am a 13.5 year old boy . I have a fine amount of pubic hair few hairs above my lip and a high amount of hair on my leg . I lack armpit hair . All my classmates have a fair amount of hair on their armpits . Even my 11.5 year old(has armpit hair) friend supposed that i did not start puberty. Can you help me please? I need ways to increase armpit hair growth as well as upper lip hair. I m getting bullied!
Bro it takes time. You shouldnt hurry about it, youre being bullied yes but its just for now, it wont last and i promise it. Youre in a process of puberty where rhe body start to change gradually. Iwas also like you back then. Iwas being bullied for having tiny voice, iwas also the smallest in class, i was a girly looking back then. But now i am one of the tallest among my classmates, got deeper voice... So it takes time and patience. And temperament for those guys who bully you. Smile bro☺.
Armpit hair is not a puberty marker. Some guys never grow any. Bullies are always ignorant = tell them to get lost. If you have body/ leg hair you are well into puberty for 13.5. No problems. < M
You can't change how fast your body develops because every body grows up at different times and rates. Being 13 or 14 ad not having armpit hair isn't abnormal. I didn't get any until I was 15.
Some males (Like my brother, who is 20) don't get armpit hair. My brother for one is the hairiest person I've ever met, with thick hairs on his arms, stomach and legs, but NONE under his armpits. In the meantime my younger 13 year old brother and myself have armpit hair. Some people just don't get it.
You are in puberty, pit hair can come in any time during puberty. Or not even get much. No big deal. I'm hairy as an ape but have very little pit hair, never have. You can't compare your genetics to anyone but a close male relative. Got pubes, you are in puberty.
Theres nothing you can do to make hair grow there but dont worry, it will eventually. Puberty effects everyone differently, some go through it all quicker than others. The good news is you're already growing hair above your lip and legs so just give it time.
People grow at different rates chill
Not necessarily, smoke of any kind can clog your pores trapping dirt inside and causing worse breakouts. Stress is a cause of acne but so are other things such as hormones, greasy foods, and not caring for your skin properly. Smoking cigarettes and or weed will not help and it will be more costly than just taking simply measures to reduce or prevent acne. I hope this helped :)
Smoke marijuana for stress free. Cigarettes suck and cause all sorts of health problems, including acne
Fags can help you relax and is more readily available than weed. Weed is more a relaxed happy state for a hour or so while a fag gives you shorter boosts of stress free but you can still work effectively with fags. If you start smoking, buy a bag of rolling tobacco and some papers. They are far healthier than premade fags.

If you are young, it is probably no problem for you to accommodate enough to see your computer. Your doctor should have done tests to see whether focusing at that distance caused strain for you. Apparently it did not. For most people being able to look up from their computer and see clearly across the room is pretty important. If your vision at your computer is not comfortable, you need to tell your doctor.
My distance glasses are no good for the computer. Its too near my eyes.
You don't trust a trained professional, so you want advice from random strangers instead. Is that correct?
Do what works.
If they are minus lenses take them off if you are comfortable without and can see.
Depends on if they help you see, or not. Only you can judge that.
No, I've never taken a painkiller that works by changing your perception of the pain.
If you mean prescription painkillers, yes. I took Percocet for a few days after getting my wisdom teeth removed.
Yes. I've had 11 operations on my left arm. Took prescription painkillers after every one. UPDATE: correction: no.
Yes, I had an addiction to them for awhile too.
Yes, last month when I had a cast on my leg
yes
yes, im on some now
Do you mean prescription? Sure.
yes only when I absolutely need them.
yeah
Generally its pretty common for guys to get erections during a massage. Just do what they ask and you will enjoy it. They have seen erections before. No big deal.
The pills I have purchased from Prolargent 5x5 Extreme website have worked as advertised. Lots better than Levitra and Cialis. Wife loves the feeling I can now give her.
1) Ofcourse it's okay, they will have seen much worse ;) 2) You could wear undies, but my advice is to just get used to it, and tell him/her that you're a bit nervous because of this. Again, they will have heard this hundreds of times. GL!
You will be covered with a blanket anyway. The only part of your body that is revealed at any given time is the part that the masseuse is working on.
When I was a youngster, I had to go to some trouble to hide mine, it wasn't easy.
If the masseur tells you to undress, do that. If that's what they tell men to do, they've seen b0ners.
Big deal. Don't worry about it at all. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Very natural thing. The therapist understands it
Honestly I've been asking mysself that too. I'm maybe going to fall off a bulding, make it look like an accident. That's what I planNED anyway. I then decided, well what's on the other side? What if it's just my devestation and loss and upset and hearbreak on a loop? How do I know that my life will end in what religeous people call Hell or Heaven? What if it's worse? My death will drag my famly down with me along with my bestfriend since I am the reason she is alive today. That and the questions relate to you. So before you do it attempt to answer my questions. Is the "after life" worse than life? Is there proof?
No. :/ why do you want to die? Think about it and your family if you weren't here any more. Forget about your problems and enjoy life bc you only get one. Make the best out of it. If you're dealing with depression ask for help. Dying may be a scary feeling for some people (me) and sometimes it might feel comfortable to others who knows. Just keep on staying strong i know you'll make it!
No, that is only a way to get out of a temporary situation that you will eventually get out of. There is a solution to every problem. You will find a solution eventually just cope with the situation you are in now. If you commit suicide now, that will be the most regrettable act that you have ever done because you will miss out on blissful moments and new experiences that you might enjoy later in life.
Trust me when I tell you, NOTHING will be worse for your family then if you end your life.. The very fact that you have questioned this subject, says to me that you don't want to die, but that right now your life is in complete turmoil and you can't seem to work thru any of it.. IVE BEEN THERE.. TWICE!!! Before you make any decisions please talk to someone... Anyone... ME!! If you're interested in talking to me, let me know and I'll give you my cell number.. I promise to listen to you..
Why would you want to die ? Why would you want to take your own life ? Trust me I've been through bulling and cyber bulling . It really does get better. I promise. Do not kill yourself . Think about your family. Your future friends. Your future husband/wife ????
No, you shouldn't. If you want to die, ask Siri about it and she'll make you contact the thing that is supposed to make people forget about dying or whatever.
No! It may sound cliche, but everyone truly has a purpose in this world. Everything has the possibility of getting better, besides when you die. Talk to someone in person, someone you trust. Please don't hurt yourself.
Great question. Most people will say there is nothing like good sex, but when your sex life is not so good, masturbation can sometimes be far more pleasurable. Some will use pictures or videos to increase the effect. The answer is yes, it is a different feeling, but depending on your individual situation, it can be nowhere near as good, or sometimes far better.
Wanking is sex , just a different variation .
Yes, as the vagina feels alot different than your hand does. It wraps the whole organ in a wet warm sensation ( though with a condom the wet sensation is not there) plus the rest of your body is able to experience her warm body as well.So your climax should be more intense and you ejaculate inside her, which is a wonderful sensation too- even if sheathed in a condom it feels awesom.
Yes. Both physically and emotionally. Orgasm is orgasm, but the sensation on the skin prior to climax is different and much better, in my opinion. Emotionally, it's much more satisfying, as well, to share the experience with another.
intercourse is 100 times more pleasurable

Who cares if you're either? You're a big boy for your age.
Not necessarily.
Having sex does not delay a period, If you have had sex, your period is due but does not come you may be pregnant
Sex won't delay a period.
Wrong all of you. Sex CAN delay your period OR speed up your period.
Sex can't delay a period.
Up to 9 months
It shouldn't. there is such a thing as 'sex shock', usually girls who have first time sex might get it and cause a period to be a little late or even early.
That's a stupid myth with no scientific merit.
It shouldn't. But i suppose everyone is different.
Nine months. Think about it.
about a day
I'm sorry it has been my own experience that it is a fast downward spiral and snow balls fast where nothing seems to go right. I recommend two books for you that changed my life. While nothing is a "miracle" they gave me greater understanding and a better ability to cope. The first is available online in PDF........ The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck...............That will help you to understand and cope. The other is meditation which Dr. Peck recommends. Here is a link to this free book. http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe....
Take a sabbatical for 3 or 6 months and try to shape up
I was depressed until one day I had just enough energy to get up and check my emails for job offers and I found none but in my email was a video on faith in Jesus and it brought happiness back into my life.
i think you need to see a psychiatrist for him to help you, im really sorry you are going through a rough time.....mental health facilities are lacking world wide now, but persist for help....if the only appointment you can get is in july, then make that appointment and pour your heart out to them, be open and honest, so the team can help you, i wish you the best.
I am about your age and this is the time that everything comes after you. This is the **** part of your life. I hate to say it but sometimes you just need to smoke a joint. Pills can be addicting, pot will just make you hungry and after a long period of time if you are anything like me... fat.
My depression was bad BUT I STARTED SEEKING JESUS AND HE CURED MY DEPRESSION AND GAVE ME REAL PEACE JESUS CAN HELP YOU IF YOU LET HIM
you see your regular doctor - he can prescibe medicine and refer you to therapy if you think that will help
Go to counselling
Who cares? Who made you smoke that shet anyway? Say no to drugs next time.
I have heard going to McDonalds during breakfast hours and ordering breakfast and orange juice cures it. Never been high so i wouldnt know
it depends on ur body type. Some body types look good with muscle and some don't. But most women by far prefer a tall skinny guy over a short and muscular guy. I learned that the hard way....
A 5'6 guy could have the body of a god but most women would still prefer a 6'0 guy with an average body.
neither I like women
dont do it for women
neither, on the stilts cuz he's too short.
I bought this Prolargentsize to give me a bit more energy as I've hit a lull in working out, while also helping in the bedroom, given that I'm working two jobs. I've only had this for a few days and I can feel a boost in my energy levels. I also feel a bit more calm and relaxed. I love that it's not overwhelming, but more of a mild increase in energy. I can definitely feel the stamina as well. I'm looking forward continuing my use of this product.
There really isn't anything you can do about your size one way or the other.
You don't, no real way to make it bigger once it reaches its final adult size- usually by age 15
a question as old as time
If 2 women spend a lot of time together they will start having their periods around the same time as each other. Happens to me and 2 of my sisters a lot. But it won't work if both people are on birth control. I think it has something to do with pheromones.
No. The most recent research concludes that the synchronised periods are a myth. My guess is (some) women notice when periods coincide, but not when they don't.
Yes often when women live together or are close, our periods are syncronised
It's not a "problem". However, the shelves at every pharmacy and many stores are filled with a dozen or so products you can wash with, insert, spay on or rub in to taste like a wide variety of flavors that have nothing to do with you. The problem with these products is that decades have proved out that they aren't healthy for you, they "mask" what is a totally normal and healthy odor and they promote both physiological addictions and a distorted belief that you need to smell like something besides yourself. Does HE need to smell/taste like something besides himself? He needn't. You needn't either. Just take a shower/bath and be clean.
You're diet affects taste and also effects how much bacteria is attracted to down there which is what causes the smell and the vagina is self cleaning however many bacteria are natural. Eating plenty of fruit can help and staying away dairy ect.
Douche right before sex. I mean like "Excuse me a moment, Dear. I'll be right back." and then use a bottle of wine, whiskey, whatever and pour it, a little bit at a time, onto your cooter. Experiment before the sex though b/c I have a hunch that 150 proof vodka might sting a bit.
Make sure you are good and clean. Best to let him do you after you have soaked in the tub. Also you can buy flavored gels that you can insert in your vagina before he does oral on you to make you taste like a fruit.
You don't need to be putting anything down there, it might cause you to have an infection. Just do what you have been doing all along. It has its' own natural smell.
Good grief -- stop capitalizing every word and use some punctuation.
roast beef smells good.
There are many ways to do it. Masturbation is about enjoying yourself and exploring that you like. www.jackinworld.com has most of the ways to do it. Enjoy.
With a helping hand.
Please stoke your cock with hand slowly and increase the speed without causing any pain. Once the cock gets erected continue to do it . The semen wiill ooze out and you will enjoy. It is masturbation . Please do it every alternate days. Regards.
With a partner, ideally. More fun that way.
Whatever way you are happy with. I prefer to lie on my bed naked and stroke my penis with my hand until erect and I ejaculate.
Do it before bedtime or after waking up early coz you have ***** and its mind blowing bro, you can watch porn if you want...
whatever way makes you happy
hands on
Just mansterbate routinely to get a pleasure and do an awkward moments in school.
Your "friends" are only using you. Stand up for yourself. Your IGCSE exams are very important and it would suck to get low grades. Concentrate on the more important thing, your education. After your exams, deal with your friends, tell them how you REALLY feel.
You need a therapist and therapy to help you. sounds like Body Dysphoria where women and girls see themselves as something they aren't. You thought process of eating more will hurt your health in the long run so don't binge, you must learn to be happy and confident in your won skin. Take Care, Sorry you're going through this.
Everything is a disorder now days. You could say body dismorphia If you really want a label. I personally think you subconsious is making excuses for why eating more isn't a bad idea. When you eat your body de stresses, and your mind is protecting you the quickest way. This happens in addiction, it may be mild now, but it can get worse. Sugar is 8 times more addicting than cocaine. I myself am addicted to food, more because it soothes my emotional problems than because I like the taste.
It's a fat *** disorder. I love you though.
It could be Body Dysmorphia.
The reason I think this is because all of a sudden, it started to swell up and get really hard and long. I measured it and it was approximately 10 inches long. I don't know how a bee could have gotten down there! Maybe it was burrowing in my foreskin? Hmm... Can someone help please? What should I do? Should I see a doctor? I asked my girlfriend and she said it was fine just the way it is but I don't really trust her diagnosing skills. HELP!!!
Your penis will be perfectly fine after a bee sting. In fact, it sounds like it made it bigger and better.
Bees are not that stupid. They don't burrow into foreskins. < M
Lol I knew where this was going...
Your body is telling you to quit isn't that a great thing after putting that poison on your body for 8 years your body had enough good for your body that is talking to you so listen!
Tobacco smoke is toxic and carcinogenic. Perhaps it's time to stop.
Sounds like you boy wants you to quit.
lung cancer? some other smoking related illness
good.
Works very well!! No side effects , such as headaches other users complain about. Would recommend and have reordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product again.
Probably prolargentsize is the best performance enhancer i have ever used. Like all natural things it took 2 days to work for what I needed, now everything works super well. For sure thi s is the top of among the top 3 for performance I have ever used or seen.
I assure you, this is it. It works just as well if not better. Also, I had no side effects as I did with the products that didn't even work very well. You can buy this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme with confidence.
Seems rather common in America. How, When , Where, and how overweight. < M
It's on the small side of average, but the fact that you are obese ( borderline morbidly obese ) that'll hide your real size.
Good , it may grow further
Adult average size exactly.
Yes, your penis is definitely very good.
No. In fact, most girls are turned off by guys who only want to show off their equipment.
I do! Can I have your email? Never mind... according to your other questions, you are 12.... can't be much to look at.
Yes, please be stupid and put your e mail address here on a public form. We all want to see.
Q
Good grief. Every man and his dog just has to have a massive wang or they're nobody. Sooner or later you realise that as far as sex/another person is concerned, it's not even relevant. IF you're that big, you're an early developer.
Still growing some I'd wager but quite good size, an inch above adult average.
You know in a year or two when it has completed its growth.
it's nice

Earlier today I got into a fight with my parents and it got way out of hand. After I went for a walk to clear my head I came back to find my ps4 and a lot of my other **** gone (including my door). I'm kind of a bad kid but not so much so that this is normal. I'm a little traumatized because my parents are usually really chill and loving so to see them so angry really bothers me. I just need some advice on how I can cope and deal with this because I feel really disturbed. I was an asshole and I deserve this but I just need some consulting.
You need to realize what you did wrong and change it, you need to start behaving! Your parents sound like they finally had enough, you can't keep doing bad things and getting away with it, people can only take so much! First you need to apologise, then you need to start listening and obeying their rules, if you do this in time you may get your PS4/door back! Remember manners don't cost a thing!
first of all, apologise to your parents if you haven't yet. now you know that you can't keep messing with your parents. you can't just do whatever you want to do with the life your parents gave you.
get a job . save every dime . move out the day you turn 18 .

Tampon use and sex have absolutely nothing to do with each other and people who have used tampons for their periods do not have easier first-time sex.
Doesn't work like that because everyone is different.
It's okay, do it in the bathroom, pretend your pooping and if the problem is p¢rn, silent your phone while watching p¢rn (it still makes you turned on), so they don't know your watching it. And besides, your 15 and it's okay for a 15yo to masterbating. I started when I was 11 but if none of these works for you Do it when you're taking a shower. It's not like it's gonna take 30 minutes. Only 5 mins is enough.
I used to masturbate in the men's toilets when I was 16 at college and at age 16 used to masturbate in the woods in a very quiet secluded spot. Alternatively I masturbate in the bathroom or my bedroom late at night -was so one else but me in the bedroom.
If your brother is older or at least have an idea what masturbation is, you can do it in your bedroom... Either his asleep or not just do it, or at least make yourself open to him, ask him or at least have a conversation with him until both of you are quite okay... Its a bro talk at first then a bro move afterwards.
Most brothers come to an arrangement with one another as both will have similar needs. Either arrange time when you and he each have privacy in the room with the other elsewhere; or simple masturbate with your brother doing something else in the room and let him do it when he needs to.
Bathroom is where I go. Never liked masturbating while in bed for some reason.
Ask a female government school teacher to pleasure you and forget about masturbating
So an arrangement with your brother is necessary. After all he is gonna masturbate too if he is more than 8 or so. < M
that stinks. You should be able to have alone/privacy time without worries. Hopefully you can at least find a place when everyone is asleep and take care of business.
You can masturbate in the morning while having bath
I'm 15 too just do it in the shower or fake taking a dump...or wait till your brother goes to sleep to do it
why is my hole of ******** vertical? people have circular hole on peni's head (where semen comes from), but mine is vertical, does it mean bad? when i try to open my hole of penis by my hands, then it open like a pacman's mouth and then it becomes circular, when i close it, then it gets old shape, how to fix that?

It is normal for the meatus (piss slit) to be a vertical oval shape when relaxed but to become more circular in appearance when you are urinating or erect. You can do nothing about the size or shape of your meatus, so don't worry.
Bro everyone is like that, I'm like that, it's completely normal and even if you wanted to change it you couldn't.
Well there is nothing to fix. Sounds normal.
what the hell, dude, of course it is vertical; often becomes circular when hard, but not in everybody
sounds like it..its a rare talent
Squirting is a more violent orgasm. Not just leaking fluids, but actually squirting them out as if you were peeing really hard. Next time you get the sensation, don't hold it in.
Nope. That's just what it feels like when your g spot is being stimulated. If you let go you will just pee
Apparenlty massaging them with cocunut oil works? Do pushups daily, even if its just 10-15. This will build your pectoral muscles and make your boobs more perkier and ultimately make them appear bigger.
This girl went from an A to a D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J_9BgV9...
You need to become fat to make your boobs bigger.
sex or alot of masturbation. helps

Not a pleasant sequence to even imagine is it. Your balls exploding due to some form of mismanagement. The screams of agony , the bloody mess, and that moment of sheer agony as you go off like a bronze cannon. Contemplation of which is apt to disturb a peaceful night sleep. Hells teeth !
Only if the prostate exploded with it. Semen is a mixture of fluids from different components. The testicles are just...two...of the components. And FYI: They aren't hollow balloons.
Matured sperm is stored in the epididymis – the coil like structure that runs across the top of each testicle so if your balls exploded all you would have is goo and blood
There is no way your balls can explode. Even if they did, sperm is produced in the glands themselves and stored in the epididymis just behind the testicles, within the scrotum. So you might see very little sperm in the unlikely event your balls did "explode".
Balls are solid organs, and do not have semen in them. They do produce sperm but it is stored in the epididymis, not the testicles. So just be blood and tissue.
Nope
Balls are solid organs, and do not have semen in them. They do produce sperm but it is stored in the epididymis,
Yes, along with all other sorts of gore. I suggest you refrain from placing explosive devices on or near your testicles.
Yes and impregnate ever women for miles around,lol,
if it isn't constant then don't worry, I was stabbed in the top of my rib cage 5 times with open scissors, it hurts still (after two weeks) but only when pressure is put on it(i.e. coughing or sneezing)
Might wanna get it checked out, possibly bruised ribs.
depends on how hard you got punched but i would still see a doctor
yes it will eventually go away.. so don't worry too much...
Please don't worry for such small things. If it is big, you should take some drastic steps in right direction and consult a professionally qualified doctor. Now you can delegate such powers to a younger person in your family, if you are really tired.
It is quite common. Having a schedule helps a lot. Try to manage your time effectively. First record the amount of time you take to do every activity, then make a schedule.
of course not, but you should keep calm and just reveal the triggers that are making your behaviors and mood changes. you need to take therapies
I was halfway through this bottle and almost gave up until my wife convinced me to just try the entire bottle. Now she loves to tell me how she was right. My performance is perfect. My penis is too hard. She says that My penis looks bigger. Prolargentsize saved my sex life.
Yes, it's pretty big. Would you like a medal to pin on it?
It's big enough that most females don't want anything to do with it mate, sorry..
It is normal for a 14 year old. < M
it's normal for your age
So it is big or small ?
I would not wait for that neurologist appt. If you go to the ER, they will do a lot of the tests the neuro does.
Large
This Prolargentsize product is wonderful, I implore whoever that is willing to give it a trial to go ahead. Quite and perfectly sure that a trial will convince you. Thumb up cheers .......!!!

Combination of healthy eating and physical activity. Cardio, in particular, is good for weight reduction. Foods such as oatmeal, almonds, berries, eggs, beans, legumes, lean meat, wholegrains, green vegetables and avocados are all recommended to reduce belly fat.

By the magic of diet and exercise
By eating less and exercising more.
Eat less. Move more.
'Nausea', not neusia. You don't need to be spraying your shorts in the waiting room in order to be believed. Most doctors now are understanding that this is a real problem. Wasn't quite the case 15 years ago, when one's IBS might be dismissed, as mine was. Times have changed. It may not be IBS. Lots of things cause nausea and diarrhea. The doctor will ask you questions and your honest answers allow them to identify what may be wrong. No one wants to waste time treating the wrong malady.
Doctor will want to know what you did, ate or drank within a couple hours of the diarrhea. While you are waiting for the appointment, keep track of those things, so you can answer him. He may also ask you what your poop looked like. So make it a point to look at it. (I am not kidding) That can help. If the family doc doesn't help, ask to see a gastroenterologist. You usually need a referral for your insurance, Good luck.
The doctor will believe you and ask other questions to try to figure out what is going on.
Nothing. It sounds like you either have a food allergy or have IBS. All you have to do is tell him it comes and goes, he will figure it out.
Possibly stress / anxiety can affect your health but if you're concerned you can always go to the doctor 😷 and go From There
You should take Tranax 1mg tablet to remove your stress completely. This tranax pills prevent mental tension esaily. You can buy tranax 1mg tablet from "MifepristonePills" online pharmacy at very affordable prices.
Ask local adults for actual info locally as it varies greatly depending on what country u live in.
You will die early of a heart attack or stroke.
Yup my therapist said caffeine is really bad for anxiety . Hold your breath in for 10 seconds help or bite the inside of your cheek . Idkkkkjk
STOP drinking caffeine, is the obvious answer. Your body does not like it.
You just open your mouth and say the word, 'No'. It's not hard. Your doctor can't insist you have one and, if you choose not to, she has to respect that decision (altho. she may ask you to sign a paper saying you were offered a pap smear but declined it). As Tavy already said, if you were here in the UK, you would not be offered one until you're 25 anyway. The belief here being there are far too many false positives in girls aged under 25 for the test to be meaningful anyway.
Sure, you can tell the doctor you don't want one and she may go by your wishes, but keep in mind that the test is for cancer. It does not matter that nothing has been in there nor your lack of sexual history. Virgins need the test. They can and do get cancer. Some cancers are not detectable until it is too late. I first had the test as a virgin. It's not as painful as you think it is. It's not painful at all and only takes a minute.
Unless you have any gynecological issues which would merit an exam, if you are not sexually active, there really is no reason to insist on a pap smear. You have an absolute right to refuse any exam with which you are uncomfortable. This is always true. Simply tell your physician that you are not comfortable with it and choose to refuse the exam. That is all you need do. No professional health care provider would view that as rude. It is your right. Again, as a physician, I see no real need for the exam at this point. Hope this helps and I wish you well.
You have the right to say no. No one can force you to have one. Her reason for doing it is to check your cervix for abnormal cells. Have you spoken with her about why you should have it done and that you are a virgin? You should be open and explain your concerns with her. As a doctor, she will want you to have a Pap smear for health reasons but if you don t want it done, tell her no.
so your gonna base something based on a video you saw on the internet well hate to break it to you never ever watch a live video of a baby being born as you'll never want to have one than and getting a pap smear done doesn't hurt and it takes less than ten minutes to do one
I'm 16 and 2 days ago I had to have one as I'm bleeding a lot and I thought I wass too young to have it but they said I needed it I felt really uncomfortable as she inserted a finger then the metal thing it really hurt me as she pushed on it I was scared but needed it done , if you don't want it done they can't force you just tell them that your not ready and that you want to wait a while
Sexually active or not, a pelvic exam is always the same. And a pap test is done to detect cancerous or pre-cancerous cells... it's important.
Of course you can refuse, it is your body. Here in the UK girls don't have it done until they are 25. My friend is 68 and has never had it done.
Most girls just using their finger or a vibrator
You don't.
Throw away the can and continue?
U wanna use your blood as lubricant??
Personally I think if you eat healthy and exercise. Weight loss gren store tea does make a difference, but if you are looking for miracles, and continue sitting on your couch. I doubt you will notice anything.
Green tea, exercise, diet
Smoking - tobacco and marijuana, maybe cocaine or crack. But I'd just stick to good ole fashioned exercise and natural food.
Exercise and healthy diet.

He is in Thailand, why would they give him free treatment because he pays taxes in the UK? That agreement has nothing to do with Thailand.
If your brother has been resident in Thailand for 10 years he is non resident in the UK. He would have to establish residence to become eligible Two thousand pounds is cheap compared with the UK.
No, you can't sue him. You can write a review about him on Yelp or his website but you can't sue him. It is good that you went to get a second opinion because I know a few dentists in my area who are more about the money than the patients. If you actually had work done by the first dentist and then had proof form another dentist that you actually didn't need the work done then you could sue him. But you cant sue him just for telling you something.
???? Never in my life (Except my next door neighbor, who had ALL Her teeth filled) have I ever heard a dentist say that. Accused you of doing meth???? That's a big Accusation! Looks like you found yourself a New dentist...screw this guy, he's in it for the money. Sure...speak to a lawyer. See what happens.
yes, i would recommend suing this dentist, only if you have proof and a good lawyer
I've been having really bad drainage in which I have to spit up some times and every now and then little tiny pieces of blood comes out of it. I've also been noticing weight loss not much but I'm back at 153 and I was like 157ish so I just lost about six pounds a few weeks ago and it hasn't gained back which I'm glad but I'm just worried cause I had a health problems when I was younger and it terrifies me that I may have cancer or lukiemia cause it runs in my family at least the cancer part . Please tell me this isn't a symptom of lukiemia
At a guess no its nothing to do with leukemia but we havent done a 7 year medical degree so go ask your doctor, Good Luck
Yes, leukemia is a very deadly disease.

ask your family! they have experience!
If you feel "wet" during the day - just going about your normal daily routine - that is vaginal discharge. Put a panty liner inside your panties. If you feel "wet" before and during sex, that is normal vaginal lubrication in anticipation of intercourse. The textures of both usually look about the same. Vaginal lubrication during sexual arousal is clear and thin. Daily vaginal discharge will usually also be clear and thin, but sometimes "whitish", thicker, and stretchy - just depending upon where you are in your monthly cycle.
Both wetness and discharge look similar although discharge is often thicker some women can feel discharge others can't
When girls/women are turned on and ready for sex they get sloppy wet. This is your bodies natural lubrication. Discharge happens at other times if it happens. Some get wetter than others. Women can also ejaculate at orgasm.
Women have mucous membranes in their vaginas and it's normal to produce up 1-2 teaspoons of it daily - some women more or less. When we are "wet" we are sexually aroused and i'd think a person would know when they are sexually aroused or not?
they are very good to eat. you should start eating both. normal discharge tastes amazing
Some are fake. But porn film directors specifically look for women with large breasts, and therefore, women with large breasts have a sure shot at porn. If a woman has really large natural boobs and wants to do porn, it's for sure they will get hired.
I'm working on that problem right now. So far I have tested 62 pair, with almost 63% being fake. I'll keep you informed as I progress .... NEXT !!
Some women get implants, others don't. Most of the time, it's obvious when a woman has had implants.
Most of them are fake but some are natural
It is pretty easy to tell ... if they are round on top, and stand out, then they got some artificial material in them ;o) If they are hanging and blend gracefully with the body, they are real.
Most of them are man made not nature.
Virginity and intact hymen are non synonyms. You lose your virginity when you have sex. Virginity is a state of having not had sex, independent of the condition one's genitals. As to whether you're hymen is intact or not, I cannot answer. The only way to assess that is to have a look at it.
No you can't loose your virginity from masturbating. It's normal for young men and women at your age to do this.
No. Losing your virginity means having sex with someone.
No. You do not lose your virginity until you have sex with another person. The hymen being intact doesn't mean anything. Many women have sex and never break the hymen, some women have a broken hymen and have never had sex.
Yes, because hymen is a cover of the entrance, just under lips. You can see medical photos or pictures, so if you stick fingers, you can pop it
You should not be careless and negligent about your mental health at any time in life. If you always maintain perfect mental health conditions, you will not get such fears.
naegleria fowleri - just another of god's delightful creatures.
I don't think this is one you have to worry about, take my word on this one.
You would have much more to be afraid of if you were on city water. Cities had harmful chemicals to the water supply, well water is much safer.

I hope you've at least informed your mom about this if she hasn't noticed already. If not, tell her. If you haven't started by 16, go see a doctor. Every woman is different
It will come when it comes u could have more baths and relax!!!! Apart from that ur lucky it hasn't started yet😊
Your period will come when i is ready, there is nothing that you can do to make it come earlier,just wait, it won't be long.
It will start when it is time. You cannot make it start and the doctors cannot make is start.
You can get a disease just by living...
If he had a disease, yes it is possible.
Yes. It's possible, especially if an outbreak is active at the time it happened.
Yeah, if he has got Ebola. You can get diseases by rubbing noses. < M
Yes, if he had a disease that as communicable, then he could do it.
if he has a disease
if he had not washed, the everyday bacteria could bother you, there's no guarantee either way.....best is to shower before and after sex
yes
no you can't
yup
They might be tasty but its really bad. Paper has chemicals, plastic doesn't degrade means it will stay forever in ur body, glue its plastic category as well n won't degrade n causes serious problems in future Might also get u into surgeries
Considering they are not edible or contain any nutrients, no it is not healthy to eat paper, plastic, or glue.
This is called pica which is an obsessive eating disorder. See a doctor that specializes in eating disorders. It is curable with help.
It's TOTALLY healthy....
Who cares?
No, and I would suggest that you consult a doctor about this.
uhhh NO
Keeping an erection for a long time is not ideal due to the amount of blood needed to maintain an erection. Continual arousal would hold it, but I recommend holding it only when necessary. I will refrain from asking why such a question needs to be asked
To hold an erection, I take my hand and rap my fingers around my erection it is that simple. If you have a problem holding your own, you might want to hang out in rest reas and other locations, there are plenty of people who will let you hold theirs for practice.
It's pretty simple. Any guy can hold an erection for just about as long as it needs to. As long as you are around there is nothing to it.
To hold an erection I usually just slightly touch it and not jerk off that way it is hard for long time and watch porn. If porn isn't available i just whisper to the little guy to keep going because maybe one day someone/something with a vagina will appreciate me. it usually helps if you have a good couple who let you watch them ****. Sometimes squeezing the muscles I use to **** works too.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme is probably the most effective product I have used. For the time I took the It made a difference in performance in the bedroom. First week i took half dose by product opening the capsules, and after full dose and performance was good.
Hold it just as anyone else would --- kite string, fork lift, without your glasses on ... whatever you need. Hold it with one hand ... if that doesn't work, trying holding it with cold metal chopsticks and your other hand.
I was amazed by how long my erectio n lasted and the girth and veins that came along with Star Buster P ills My wife was very happy. It works fast and last for days. I b ought from w..star-buster…..c
Take some Viagra
Hold it with your right hand then rip it off
If its yeast you can treat it with over the counter meds. But if its bacterial vaginosis ( an imbalance in vaginal bacteria) then you need antibiotics. You can also ask at a health store for vaginal pH supplements. I'd easy, treat it like a yeast infection first but if it doesn't get better you really should see a doctor. Ask your school nurse about clinics in your area.
I've been having discharge for 7 years now. The vagina is just simply cleaning itself out. There is no way to get rid of it because I asked my doctor. You can however wear pantyliners if it's annoying you.
You can buy a test at the store. It tests to see if it is yeast or bacteria.
what color is the discuarge? If it is white or clear it is ok, if it is green or yellow you have an infection
Yep, and you'll go blind! Please...get serious and think about it for a second, body parts don't just fall off, the Ken doll is not made anatomically correct to begin with
I don't even have a penis and I can tell you with 100% confidence that this is not true
No. Your penis cannot "fall off".
If that is true all men in the world will have no cocks. LOL . Regards.
my dick would have fell off about five hundred times if this were true lol
Haha no
Why are all your questions stupid, phony questions?
maybe yours but not mine
Large
It can vary signifigantly When its with a girl i *** more.. Not sure why it happens but it just does also if youve cummed alot recently it wont be as much life if you **** off or have sex multiple times after 3 times or so it will be a little bit but say its been a week and you have sex it will be huge and explode out
Myself
I was pretty shocked at just how much it was. It's different from time to time, but I remember thinking "wow how does your body even do that" lol to someone who hasn't seen it before, it does seem like a lot. And it can kind of go everywhere if he lets it, it can be messy. If your ready for sex this isn't really a big deal, you can laugh things off like that.
yes, it varies. sometimes the same guy cums a lot some days very little. it takes a few days for the amount of come to build up so if they havent released it in a few days theyll probably be a lot of ***
I watch all the time either myself or my friends. Sometimes I have a wonderful orgasm but hardly *** and other times I *** pretty good. This holds true for my friends as well. Also, age plays a big factor. 25 years ago I could shoot across the bed, now only a foot or so.
Plenty of times, I have not seen it in awhile because it's usually inside of me, the last time I had sex it was a whole lot, it started running down my legs as soon as I got up.
I masturbated as I watched my lady have sex w/ a friend & it was a big turn on. So much that my ejaculate was the largest I ever released
I have a pretty big vacation coming up in 4 weeks and would like to lose some weight. I am 5'6.5 and about 120 pounds give or take a few... havent weighed myself in about a month.. (I weighed 118 when I did though but I think I gained since then). I run everyday (for 60-120 minutes... depending on the day). My problem is with snacking. I find it very difficult to control exactly what I eat and not snack in between. So first, is it possible to lose 10 pounds in a month? Second, how can I make sure I follow a set eating schedule and not snack? Advice? Thanks!
Yes. You have to be dedicated. If you're referring to junk food snacks, kick those snacks to the curb for the next 4 weeks! Have breakfast, then 2.5 hours later have a light, healthy snack, then have lunch, 2.5 hours later have another light, healthy snack, have dinner, and end your day with a protein shake. Definitely keep exercising, especially cardio. It's the smallest changes that help us lose weight.
I got Weight Loss Green Store Tea product one month ago and it already seems to be working exactly as advertised. In fact, so far I have absolutely nothing negative to say about it gave 6 lb. I recommend to visit Weight Loss Green Store Tea product !!
yes you can , maybe 12 but eat clean and exercise like run- jog - walk - swim - bike for 1 hour good luck :D
she is like a 10/10, had an obvious crush on him, and he turned her down. i don't understand how any reasonable straight guy could turn a hot girl down so easily. he is also not going to prom this year bc he is supposivey "too busy". and there have been many rumors going around in my school that he is gay and couldn't perform when he slept with a girl...before i didn't believe them but now I'm beginning to think they might be true. i have always thought he was a bit strange for showing no interest in girls even though lots of girls found him attractive
Perhaps he simply has problems being around crowds, or can't dance so fears going to the prom and being embarrassed. Sounds like a real leap to decide he is a homosexual just because he turned down a girl to go when more obvious answers are out there. How about just ask him why he turned her down, and tell him you'd hold his answer in confidence.
Why do u feel the need to care about his decision..and if thats Ur so called friend y don't u stand up for him if someone calls him gay or why donut tall to him about u ******* bully ..and just because u think she's hot doesn't mean he thinks so and how is he gay if girls are coming up to talk to him about going to the prom 🚮
Im more concerned that you think a guy needs to go out with every girl that likes him like hes desperate or something. He does his own thing obviously and that's exactly why girls like him so much. He will know when he finds the right girl and its not gonna make sense to you or anyone else but all that matters is its right for him.
Maybe the guy is just stressed out, or shy. If he couldn't perform, it could've been for the same reason. Perhaps he IS too busy. Doesn't mean he's gay. Damn.
gayness is not measured in turning down a really cute girl.
Dosent mean he's gay, maybe he's just not interested in her. Just because she's cute dosent mean he has to automatically accept her invite
yea i have a friend who was similar. he turned out to be gay in college
So the calories I don't burn gets stored as far. That I know. I'm 15 years old and female: about how many calories should I have a day? How to I make sure I eat the right amount? And how do I make sure I burn off all my calories. THANKS EVERYONE IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR ANSWERS!!! (Best answer will be awarded to the person who helped me the most)
The amount of calories you eat depends on how much you exercise. For some, they'd only eat 1000 , some would eat 1500 and some would eat 2000, etc, etc. Try to find out by experimenting, I guess, (that's what I did). For your age, though, and the act you're a girl, try around 2500 to 3000 seeing as you still have some growing to do I'm assuming.
Chips and guacamole. A cheese stick. Toast and peanut butter. A chicken sandwich. An apple.
Greek yoghurt with chia seeds if a snack.
A bowl of green chile with corn tortillas on the side.

No, sounds like you need to look up puberty and see what it entails. Would be extremely rare for a 20 yr old to just be starting puberty.
Not normal, and likely associated with testosterone deficiency. In that case, you likely would produce weak ejaculations, so you can determine that. You will have to see your PC Doctor, get evaluated, then referred to an Endocrinologist, as suggested before.
No. That is kind of old to start. Go get a physical.
No it isn't. Go talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to an endocrinologist.
No thats unusual.
No. See a doc.
If you had throat cancer you would have problems swallowig and not eating muchso no you woul not gain weight and probably lose weight, ask your doctor but it is probably a throat infection
If you eat a lot and don't exercise much, the weight gain is almost guaranteed. And it has nothing to do with throat cancer, diagnosed or not.
Yes, free sex within wedlock + binge eating can help you to gain weight.
maybe untreated thyroid cancer - or even from having a goiter on your thyroid.
I'd imagine you'd lose it instead.

Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Probably because your overall health is poor. Do you eat bad diet of junk food and sodas? Do you lay around the house all day playing video games? Do you stay up all hours of the night and have poor sleep habits? Think about your lifestyle bro. Think about making some changes

Why did you take Plan B after intercourse when you are on your period and when your boyfriend didn't have an orgasm inside you? Women are NOT fertile during their period. Maybe educate yourself about your own body and reproductive system. Don't they teach this stuff in school anymore?
No, but plan B will mess up your period for a couple of cycles.

I'm 17 and I hit puberty when I was 13. Most of my puberty went to my basement area, and i have barely gotten any body hair besides leg hair and some pit hair. I recently began growing chest and stomach hair a couple months back, but for three or so years all of my hormones? I guess went down there, leaving me with a 5 inch soft penis, but erect it's about 8 inches. Is this big or small for my age? I'm 18 the 5th of next month
Your penis at 8 inches is big for your age or any age.
This Prolargentsize product definitely does what is says! I also like that the formula is not so intensely long they found certain natural ingredients to achieve the desired effect , formulated and succeeded.
Yours are bad, but not terrible. I know of people who have -11/-13. I have heard of people with -20. Yours will continue to change, probably for a few years, then they are likely to stabilize.This is typical for people with myopia. After they stabilize, you might even be able to have surgery in order to permanently correct your vision. But until then, you get to wear glasses or contacts so you can see clearly.
5.5/10 Slightly worse than average but not much worse.
Yup. Perfectly fine.

You should really ask your doctor! Best of luck (:
Yes, deli meats can cause weight gain. Eating too much of anything can cause weight gain.
Eating the sandwich with mayo and cheese, plus sides, can be a factor in weight gain. I gained weight from big lunches. But, try to calculate calories to remove any mystery about weight gain.

Drinking lots of water makes you pee, does not increase semen volume. Waiting 2 days won't make a substantially larger amount of semen, that is mostly myth because semen is generally produced on demand by your glands (prostate, cowpers glands) and so you don't "build up" any by abstaining.
wait for 3 days but drinking lots of water has got no connection with the load
Drinking more water does not produce more semen. Your prostate gland where semen is produced is only about the size of a walnut and can only produce a set amount of semen at any given time. Semen is not produced and then stored somewhere like urine is stored in the bladder. Semen comes directly from the prostate gland during ejaculation.
Big load depends on the lenght of time you last cvm. But i dont know for sure if drinking alot of water may affect the volume of your semen...
you can drink ten thousand gallons of water if your wish, but it wont make the slightest difference to how much seminal fluid you ejaculate. this is governed by the prostrate gland which means that just about a teaspoon worth of seminal fluid is ejaculated
Maybe if you have good motility... but why are you trying to produce a big amount - is it a contest?
try it a find out
Dunno = try it. < M
If you're worried about breast cancer, I would recommend feeling around your breast tissue for any lumps that do not move. Ones that do are ok, however sore breasts can mean many things, from your period hormones, bras not fitting properly, working out your chest too much, pulling something, or not supporting your breasts enough can attribute to breast pain.
Not always. Sometimes painful breast means some other disease or injury. And sometimes a person can have breast cancer without feeling any pain at first. If you have painful breast, see a doctor.
No. It could mean a handful of things. Cancer lastly. Definitely something to bring to a doctor's attention though, in case.
Not necessarily, do you have reason to suspect pregnancy? could just be soreness, Feel your breasts for lumps, if theres an irregular lump, go to the doctors
Nope. Sounds completely hormonal. Speak to your doctor.
No,but you should go to hospital.
How many years training does it take to be a Gyny? How many patients would he have seen. Why is he being paid huge amounts of money if you don't believe him.

Most rashes don't need medical treatment and will resolve if you leave them alone. It's good to make sure the skin is clean and to avoid clothes that are snug against the rash. Finding the cause of a rash is often futile. Things to consider are new clothes, new detergent, new fabric softener, and more standing or exercise than usual. If you can share a photograph of the rash or describe it and its location, we can guess more intelligently.
Skin irritating
Buy some rash cream
That's easy if you're not sure what it's from go see a doctor .
I don't have any interest in being a nice person. I'm not worried what people think and I only worry about myself. I have no interest in my family I can't stand my family but I live with my parents so I'm stuck having to go to these stupid family gatherings. I usually just ignore people and the only time I laugh is when someone is telling a poop story.
if you are questioning that you are screwed up because of that than you have some sort of good in you sorta im not saying ur bad but try to do some good in ur eyes and see if you feel different from doing things like that.
No, all's right with the world. Total satisfaction and adjustment is in some disaffectedness. Otherwise, your adults would think that they aren't getting a good deal. Simple psychology of the deal. That's what adults understand and how they think.
Yes. You are the part of the 10% of the population that has trouble relating to the rest of us. People in this 10% are the world's most successful or are the people in prison.
Yes, but God can help you. Turn away from sin and accept Jesus.
Absolutely! I lost 80 pounds!! I was 225 and am 145 now. I did it by writing down EVERYTHING I ate, and adding the calories as I went through the day. I had 1,200 calories a day. This was the ONLY way I could lose weight. I felt the accountability of what I was putting into my mouth and how easily calories add up and how you can't just eat whatever, whenever. To eat 1,200 calories a day, you have to eat pretty healthy. I kept it in a spiral notebook I still have. YOU CAN DO IT!!!!
It's very simple, eat healthy. Go to pinterest, there are plenty of different ways to eat vegan food without it being just salads. And get out there and walk like 30 minutes each day, replace all sugary drinks with water, and replace coffee with tea.
You got your height from your dad's side of the family. Height doesn't just contribute to only your parents. You are just like me! My mom is 5'7 and my dad is 5'5 and when i was 12 i was 5'8. Now i am 14 and 5'11. I got my height from my mom's side because my grandpa (mom's side) is 6'2 and my mom's brother is 6'3. I'm also pretty sure that since you started puberty at 12, and outgrew your parents at 12, you are more than likely finished growing. You could be lucky to grow another half inch.
Everyone is a combination of both parents DNA and their ancestors. If you had a great grandfather with red hair it could skip a generation or two and you could be born with red hair when your parents both have brown hair. If your grandfather was 6.5 then you could be that tall even though your parents aren't. We are all a combination of past and present relatives.
Your height is genetic and not surprising- genes can be recessive in some offspring and whole generations and then become dominant in another. You likely just lucked out and got the dominant height gene for taller height, and certainly have the genetic history to prove that.

You should really check with your dentist, rather than us. But it could be that you are irritating your gums by using a stiffer toothbrush than you should, do you use the "Soft" type? My guess is that "a little red" may be just the right color for healthy gums. Do check , though. Good wishes,

You can find the answer to your question by doing a simple experiment. 1. You can measure the amount you pee 1 time and then multiply that by how many times you have peed throughout the day. But this will only be an estimate because you many urinate more or less urine at different times of the day. 2. Measure your urine each time you pee and add it up at the end of the day. This will be more accurate then the first option.

Acne bacteria - these pads will help - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming?

These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Don't drive yourself crazy finding out if this that or the other causes acne, quite frankly, washing your face more often, avoiding certain food or drinks, sleeping more, ...etc. does very little to effect the overall outcome. Acne has more to do with genes and hormones than anything else. In other words, if your skin is prone to acne... you are going to get it no matter what. If you want to get rid of acne in the meantime get bevoline by skin divine. It is a phenomenal product that clears your acne by blocking the bacteria that causes it. You can get it cheaper on Amazon if you have prime. I hope my answer helps. Good luck!
It can be many things; hormonal issues, sebum (the oil your skin produced naturally), clogged pores, really many ways. There can also be different types of acne people develop such as cystic or simply a breakout every now and again. Factors such as your diet and health will determine some of the reason behind if you develop acne.
It's various of things such as:not washing your hands and touching your face,Oily skin,using the wrong products on face or etc. Some people have sensitive skin and we can't use certain products. People tend to touch their face a lot it's out of habit so just make sure your hands are clean and also it can just be you're hormones. I've heard of certain foods breaking your face out such as greasy products and Soda.
The main cause of acne is buttface. I think, not sure, it might be...
Cancer is the term used for a number of diseases caused by cell malformation. For example, Lymphoma is a disease that is a form of cancer. Many diseases do not involve cancer, while some do.
Cancer is the name for a group of diseases. A bit like virus is a name for a group of diseases. Big difference is that cancer is NOT contagious.
Cancer is not a disease. You can't catch it like an infection. Cancer can be thought of like a malfunction in the body. It's when the cells in your body multiply uncontrollably

You can still grow a little more but if you don't, you will be fine. Forget what you see in porn as it is not the norm.
5 inches is on the smaller side of average, but average just the same. And keep in mind that most pornstars are the guys that are very well hung. Usually well above average.
Average adult size is 5.16 inches so you are average size. No idea if yours is normal or not, guys look all ways down there.
Nothing in porn is real, don't compare yourself or your partners to them.
We gonna tell yo mama you been watching porn, little boy!
That's really not on. How selfish is your husband! If I were you I'd get far away from him. You can't just meddle with a persons medications it's dangerous and nasty. I would ring a helpline and explain the situation. Good luck.
I would start by calling the police... they can arrest him and/or force him to give you back your meds. In addition you will need the police report to help you during the divorce. If you can show he abused you (withholding necessary medication is abuse) then you will come out on top in the divorce.

You have some good answers so try the given suggestions. Use warm not hot water as this dries out your skin. Use a 'non-soap' like Cetaphil or Dove. Put some lotion on as soon as you get out of the shower and before you dry off so you retain he moisture. Cetaphil makes a great cream but you can use any mild lotion. Look for one that is allergenic like Eucerin.
So does mine, the bottom of my legs always burn after a shower. I went to the doctor and he said I have an allergy to the shower gel I use. So go to the doc and get it checked :)
put a good filter on the shower, it will remove the chlorine, and that should end the problem....aquasana sells a good one for 60 dollars
use a shower gel for sensitive skin , dry yourself , then put , lotion on for sensitive skin .
maybe the water your using it too hot

Okay so I wanted a baby (even though I'm only 15 I know I was really depressed) but I could never manage to get pregnant I would time everything right but recently I have been constantly nauseous for the past 2-3 weeks severely bloated and now I have a severe pain in that whole area when I have sex I also have been extremely tired and however much I sleep it doesn't help my mom has had ovarian cancer twice please help
A 15 year old should not be having sex and trying to get pregnant. You are not in a position where you are likely to be able to provide a child with the care, nurturing and support that every child needs, for longer than your own lifetime! Sounds like your unprotected sex has led to an infection. See a dr and get it treated or you could end up permanently infertile and never have a chance at that baby you want. Hopefully you will not fall pregnant until you are in a position to realise that a baby and depression is a bad combination.
Sigh.......and at what age has your mom had ovarian cancer? In her 30's and 40s?? YOU"RE 15!!!!! This is pure imagination.
Sounds like it could be an ovarian cyst or PID. If you are having symptoms, you should make an appointment with your gynecologist. When you're there, make sure to mention how you've been trying to get pregnant. And if you don't have a gynecologist? You should- any woman trying to conceive should see her gynecologist.
Those are not symptoms of ovarian cancer. You have signs of some type of infection - possibly PID, which is usually accompanied by Chlamydia or other STD. You need to see a doc with these symptoms. You probably need antibiotics. If you have PID, one of the consequences can be infertility. If its not PID it could be an even more serious type of infection.
If your mum has had it twice it means that you have a risk of also getting the disease. Even though it is rare at your age i would suggest seeing a doctor if you are worried as it is sometimes known as the 'silent killer' as it can go unnoticed for so long. So better being safe than sorry and organising an appointment.
Rare
Sounds more like an STD but go ask your doctor for tests.
Go to the doctors and get it checked out, better safe than sorry
Because deep inside there is still hope.. There is still something to live for I believe.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online

Never rely on Internet "Home remedies"...it will just make things worse.
why would you think that would work? use Clearasil or something with Benzoyl Peroxide in it - you know, Actual acne medicine
try dabbing visine on them.
Definitely worth getting a second opinions. I'd be interested to know what kind of tests he performed? It may not be 'heart' pain, like the others said it could just be anxiety. It could also be gastrointestinal related (heart burn etc). But seeing as you're so young I would definitely be getting it checked out by someone else. They need to do an ECG and take bloods from you at the very least. Good luck :)
It could easily be Precordial Catch Syndrome (PCS). You are a bit on the old side for it, but it can happen. What PCS is is a localized pain happening around a nipple area of the chest. You may feel more pain when you breath. After a couple minutes you will feel a bubbling sensation and shortly after the pain will likely stop. It is very common for people to mistake PCS for a heart attack.
Chest pain in young people are usually anxiety or gas. Rarely is it heart related.
Don't listen to the doctor that it's "nothing" see a different doctor ASAP!
I'm Not Sure but i think you should go see you doctor NOW
It is almost certainly anxiety. Get your dr to treat you
It may just take time for you to grow to get used to it. I remember hating my boyfriends snoring at night, but now I can't sleep without it. If you hate it so much try propping his head up on a couple more pillows.
Try and get to sleep before he starts snoring, thats what my partner has to do because of my snoring
It seems like you're not too patient or mature of a person yourself. Buy him some anti-snore strips or just deal with it. Or you can get a new boyfriend. I'm sure you annoy people too and probably snore but don't realize it.
There are mouth guards that you can buy to reduce snoring
Nothing it is completely normal for a penis to bend one way or another. It has nothing to do with the way you masturbate.
Nothing, nothing wrong with a bend or curve. All normal.
Nothing. Most all penises have some degree of Bend or curve to him. That's normal.
Normal.
Nothing. A lot of penis' do that, there's nothing wrong with it.

Earlier today after I saw ghetto booty at Walmart. I love that stankass booty baby, I'm all about that black pussie and that stankass booty. Nothing turns me on more than that black ghetto pussie baby.
Yesterday and today I shaved off the pubic hairs.

By your mid 20's your eyesight will have settled to its adult level. It may change marginally from thereon due to normal aging but there is nothing you can do which will adversely affect your astigmatism.
by staring at the computer while laying down, reading columns repeatedly 24/7 i strongly advise against this, :/
why? Are you trying to go blind? Visit an eye dr. and they will fit you glasses or contacts so you can see perfectly.
An ice pick.
Moron.
Not unless the doctor orders it. If it's been there for 5 years it is doing her no harm.
She's fine
Only if her doctor recommends it.
yes it should
you should have done years ago
I m as out as lucky as a black cat. Nothing ever goes my way and everything I do just ends in disaster. People tend to avoid me because they think I m bad luck. Frankly im in a spiral of depression and at times I just think that it would be easier to just end it all. Sometimes I think that death would be a holiday for me bit anything is better than my life people fear death but for me I welcome it. Your all probably think I m an attention seeker but put on my boots and you will see.
The universe doesn't hate you. You can't give even one example. People avoid you because you're bitter, and probably unpleasant to be around. Life would be better if you stopped screwing everything up. Consider therapy.
Life is one big train wreck followed by brief happy commercial breaks...
I eat a lot of soup
Now now, cats as well as black ones have many lives, so pick one you enjoy more
Just look up 'food combining' on the Internet to find a huge number of resources that explain why it is difficult for the human stomach to digest two different kinds of protein. For a good explanation of food combining, see the classic book "Fit for Life" by Harvey Diamond and Marilyn Diamond. It all started with studies by Pavlov using dogs as test subjects for his research on digestion of foods.
It already can. Find your own sources. There are plenty online with a small amount of effort on your part.
It can.
A few days ago,I took a q tip and put sink water on it,and then put it inside my nose to clean it out...It wasn't dripping wet,but it was wet enough..Anyway,we use well water and I don't think it's treated..I just found out that you can get naegleria fowleri from well water...I'm soo scared..My neck now hurts,it feels odd,and my head kept hurting a bit off and on the past few days...I'm 17 and very scared I've got this,help!!!
I hope your bucket list has only 1 or 2 things on it, otherwise you're screwed.
As said before, it's all in your mind....The pain you have is from your over bearing anxiety attacks. Take some tylenol.
See a physician for heaven's sake!
Well, go see a doctor. This has nothing to do with religion.
Has anyone ever asked you "If you only had one day to live, what would you do?"... time to get started on that list.
Stop worrying about nothing! Sperm die shortly after hiting air and landing on skin and clothes and things like that. They would be dead long before it made its way through any fabric.
Possible? Yes. Likely? Probably not.
No, only through Normal natural course or artificial insemination only
Yeah, she could very well be pregnant. Nah. lol
Plz help me out wid this ...m worried Plz i want the dr or the experts to plz answer to dis.....
It is possible.
Sounds like a sinus infection draining or some other form of post nasal drip causing a throat infection.
You probably won't get good answers here because even if we were all doctors, we would need to see you to diagnose you
I am getting thinner and thinner, but the scale does't change the numbers....?! I AM trying to build up muscles, which must be working since the scale does not change.... My question is : Is gaining Muscles while losing fat better than JUST losing fat ? And will the scale catch up at some point? I am a 24 year old girl, in case that makes a difference.... Thank you guys !!
I was very skeptical to try it but . Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is simply amazing!, Well, let me tell you, it was SO worth the price! I've been drinking it for about 3 weeks. The first week I only drank it twice a day and missed a day or 2 in there due to not remembering. That first week I lost only about 3 lbs. The second week I've been drinking it three times a day for the most part and have lost about 6-7 lbs more than the 1st week, for a total of about 10 lbs in the first 3 weeks. I found it from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea !
You don't do both at once, since they require opposite ends of the calorie spectrum. Weight loss requires a deficit, muscle gain requires a surplus. Being stronger is always better, IMO.
You lose weight faster with larger muscles as muscles mass uses calories 24/7.
No. It's dumb, mind. A UTI is incredibly treatable and doesn't usually require anything worse than giving a urine sample and taking some cheap pills. And on rare occasions UTIs progress to the kidneys and cause much more serious trouble. And even if it doesn't progress you're going to have a lot of needless pain and suffering. But no, nobody can make you go to the doctor with a UTI.
Yes! If you think you have an UTI, go see a doctor to get prescribed the proper medication to handle it.
Just drink lots of water for bout three days and if still have burning n all then go to doctor
If it doesn't go away in a few days, yes you should go see a doctor.
Certainly a good idea yes.
Yes, you do. You need antibiotics to cure it.
YTEWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
any eye drops that relieve red eyes will work. or you could not get baked as ****. if your eyes are only a little red in the morning no one will notice. so if you get a little baked no one will notice. also don't take your **** into the school, put it in your car or a friends car and park somewhere off campus.
Buy some clear eyes redness relief at your local store or pharmacy. You shouldn't be getting high before school, but that's what I use to use.
Visine eye drops.
It is not very easy to do it.
The Skene's gland is the source of squirting, and most women, especially young women do not squirt. It just happens out of nowhere for most women the first time during intercourse, unless they have a lover who knows how to stimulate the Skene's gland manually. And a bunch of liquid doesn't come shooting out of the vagina.. it just flows out... sometimes there is a lot of it.. up to 1/2 - 1 cup. G00gle it.
It is actually piss, It is a big turn on because some guys like me like to be wet and have the bed soaking and sopping wet.

Wrong section my friends. :)
Nicotine does not cause cancer but can cause other health problems. It is useful to help people stop smoking but once people stop smoking they should try and wean themselves off nicotine. Add: while nicotine is safer than tobacco it is not a safe poduct, it is less damaging.
No, nicotine does not cause cancer or any health problems.
Nicotine is a poison which primarily makes addictive and kills brain cells. The carbon monoxide is what primarily causes cancer. If you were talking about smoking...
If you are chewing, it can cause gum cancer, smoking it can cause lung cancer. Play your cards.
no . its the smoke that causes cancer.
No
Most fats are good for you apart from trans fats or hydrogenated fats. These may interfere with the ability of the cells of the body to metabolize the fats that are good for you. There is also strong evidence that saturated fats aren't as bad for you as was once first thought.
No, of course not. Things like nuts, seeds, avocados, olive oil, coconut oil are good for you. Even small amounts of grass fed butter is good for you. You want to avoid things like fried food, vegetable oil (canola is the worst), anything from a fast food joint...
No, not all fats are considered bad for your health. The bad ones are the saturated fats and trans fats which raise blood cholesterol and contribute to clogged arteries and heart disease and stroke. The good ones are the unsaturated fats. The best fats are found in olive oil, canola oil, nuts, avocado, salmon, sardines, and tuna. The bad fats are found in fatty meats, high fat dairy products, coconut oil, palm oil, and cocoa butter. Generally about 25% to 35% of our calories should come from unsaturated fats.
No. Plant based fats are very healthy. Majority of your daily fats should be from them, and a small percentage from animals.
No. People need healthy fats in their diets.
Not. Good fats are actually really good for you. Good fats include olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil. Here is an article about it: https://disqus.com/home/channel/lowcarbl...
No
I was struck when pulling out destroying my car. a speeder struck me not me them! i was ticked and the larger impact was sever ptsd depression ensomina been a year sense it happed. It caused me to lose my job. My wife divorced me over my injury leaving a scar on my face. I now live alone and am depressed. I feel like that speed stole my life from me. I wish I could go back in time and never of stopped to get fuel that day. I am unable to work drive or sometimes even eat. I want my life back I
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
You'll get over it because everyone does and riding in a car is not something you can avoid in our society, unless you live in a big city.
If it was not your fault you can sue for damages. See a lawyer. If you hit your head you may have MTBI. It is worth learning about it.
I really can't deal with your nonsense tonight, so I'm sending you elsewhere. If that upsets you, and you'd like to make the case that I'm doing that unfairly, feel free to contact me and explain.
I don't care about celebrities
I chat to a guy who was some character in the harry potter movies, but I never watched them myself, so I don´t know anything else.
Need Muslims girlfriend
None of what you say is correct and to be sure you have never met any of these people or met anyone who knows them.
No
tell your voice that it isn't you and has no right to control you. over through it. if it doesn't work, go to the doctor, but i don't think they can do anything.
This is serious. Go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
You can give up almost any drink except water. Your body will atleast require that. You can also give up almost any food. Main food people give up is carbohydrates. But if you do that make sure to lower over time so your body can adjust to using other nutrients for energy. You can give up meat but make sure you're still getting a good amount of protein from other sources.
I gave up drinking fruit juice and eating cheesecake for a year when I was losing weight.
easy question: brussel sprouts, mom makes me eat them before i can have dessert :(
I could give up monkey brains. No problem.
Atenolol will help, that's why he gave it to you. Sure there were a couple of fine days...anxiety is like that.
Why did you go to the ER unless you wanted treatment? If you want a more thorough investigation then the ER is the wrong place, go to your regular doctor.
Are you a male or female?
Using a tape measure is not hard, at all, relax. You just have to know how to count and how to read the measurements. Just go to YouTube and type "how to read a tape measure" and "how to work a tape measure" and you'll be fine.
Seriously? How can anyone not know how to use a tape measure?
Have you ever considered terminating your lying asss? You really should. If you can't already read a tape measure then a week probably isn't enough time. Please tell me that you're not a college graduate. Please?
it is exactly like a ruler only longer.
It's not likely. Best thing to do if you're worried about potentially having cancer is to set up a screening with a doctor. It may be that you have chronic acid reflux (something I suffer from; same symptoms). Try drinking more water, use an over-the-counter drug like Zantac, Prilosec, or a generic acid reducer and see if that helps. When I get acid reflux, my throat feels tight and a bit sore, and it can hurt to swallow. I just drink plenty of water and take an acid reducer and I'm fine within the hour. Best of luck to you.
There are about 16,000 new cases a year and 0.0% of new cases are in people under 20. So lets assume with a rounding error it is 0.04% of new cases. That means AT MOST there are about 6 new cases per year in the entire US in people under 20. This is probably an overestimation.
Anyone can have cancer at any age. Rather than ask us, why haven't you made an appointment with a doctor for an exam? Let the doc tell you that you don't.
Sounds like excess acid or possible gallstones
What you describe is GERD, not cancer. See my source to treat it.
You cannot give yourself an STD. And ingrown hairs look like ingrown hairs-you see the hair curled up under the skin. Red dots mean you irritated your skin. May have not rinsed well or left shave cream on too long. Few guys shave, most only do it once.
Yep, probably ingrown hairs. Well, not shaving them is quite a good treatment. Nature puts them there for a good reason. < M
Yes, it is ingrown hair. That's why you shouldn't shave them. It's pointless because they will grow again in a day or two. I did it once too and regretted. You can cut the pubes like you do with your hair, but shaving is not a good idea.
and that's why you never shave it all off due to the bumps and irritation that comes from doing it and trim it so it looks nice and just give it a few days for the hair to start growing back in and that's gonna be itchy too
shaving is silly
do not shave again. duh!
Ok so my little brother keeps going into his room randomly and locking the door, and I'm kinda worried he is vaporizing weed in his room! The reason I am worried is becuase it concerns me becuase the vapor goes through out the house and it can get me high! And I don't want to get high ever again! So basically I want to know how to find out if he is vaporizing weed in his room? Like will it smell even if it's a vape? Will the room be really hot? How do I know for sure?? Without asking him? And another thing, will I get high going into his room after he gets out
Here is what you do homie, you go in there and if it's like musty and like REALLY HUMID. HE was probably vaping something lmao. You CAN get high from previous vape but it's really hard, you gotta be in there for hours sucking it all the time. I'd just ask him, if he says he is just be cool and go smoke some! Weed changed my life dude! It's a drug you can't get addicted to and it's a great time (for like 30 minuets then your just hungry xD) Btw why is this question in "Dogs" LMAO
What is WRONG with you? Unless you're joining the military a little passive weed smoke is not going to affect you at all.
You can't get high from second hand weed smoke, and it won't show on a drug test. Just tell your parents.
Cant help you. There isnt any reason to stop. Masturbation is nothing more than simple self pleasure. It sounds like you have a mental disorder of some type.
If you get a partner you will probably cut it down somewhat. If not, you are not harming anyone, and as you get older you will probably get the urge to do it less. The guilt might come into it possibly for some religious reason, or the fact that you believe you have no willpower. Reading more and time itself will give you the answer you want. I would be more worried if I did not have any urge to do it at all.
Just solo sex, safest sex you can do. Most guys (well over 90%) do it regularly and average rate is at least once a day. Total myth there is any harm in a normal bodily function.
just solo sugar, safest sugar you can do... most guys (well over 90%) do it regularly and average rate is at least once a day... total myth there's any harm in a normal bodily function...
u need to take a either a small or large dose of lexapro, it will stop u from masturbating. and its safe ssri.
Dont' know what to tell you. You change behavior thru diffrent habits, different thinking.
Cut off your hands
You would need to take a prescription drug to reduce the normal male hormones in your system.
eat a whole raw potato when u feel the urge and just stare at ur mom
get rid of porn
Yes. Its a gene that causes Tay Sachs Disease - one of the most horrific diseases that could ever occur in a child.
Did you not read that God rejected the Jews at the death of Jesus? Did you not study in history that God destroyed the Temple with not one stone left on top another? Have you not read that God took His name from Israel, Judah and Jerusalem in 2Kings 23:26-27? Did you not study and see that Jews were chosen to be servants to the world with being entrusted with the truth and that from them came the Savior? Nothing else makes them special. Nothing.
Anyone with any genes can convert to Judaism. And a convert becomes chosen by choosing to accept special responsibilities. But I suppose you have chosen to remain confused.
Tay Sachs. Anyone can get it but Jews are twice as likely.
No. There is no such thing as the "Jew gene". In fact there is some credence to the Jewish "lineage" being a myth in general. most are gypsy/russians with semitic pretensions.
There are certain groups of Jews which have high rates of genetic disorders. Tay-Sachs Disease being the most well-known.
Yes, their women have huge perfect breasts. That could be on one or several genes.
No. I suppose one set of kooks might define a "real" Jew by an arbitrary gene. Don't trust them.
Every nationality has a unique gene, that what makes it a nationality. Well, a unique genetic makeup compared to the next. Pretty small differences, really. DUH
I want to get my penis to be heavier so it hangs down. It sort of sticks out not down when I'm flaccid and I want it to look bigger and heavy. What are some ways I can do this? Do i have to do exercises or eat the right foods or take supplements or not masturbate for a while?? I masturbate around 4 times a week..does this have anything to do with it? I just want it to look fatter and heavy..
I'm afraid you've got a "grower" when you want a "shower". You're stuck with what nature has provided you.
You need to stretch it. One way is to tie a brick to it on a short string and repeatedly drop the brick until you reach the desired length.
Simple = you grow older. Most young boys stick out, most old guys it just hangs there. < M
LOL... no. None of us have any say and what our height is going to be. And once we've stopped growing you can't make yourself start growing again smart one. Don't live in a fantasy land, live in reality.
Kys
There's nothing to do. That's it.
platform soles .
stretching will do.
You gotta: - eat less - exercise plenty - choose healthy foods Cardio (walking, running, jump-rope, etc.) is the best type of exercise for losing weight. Fruits and veggies are super healthy and low in calories. Try to eat lots of them.
Take psyllium husk , one tea spoon full with one glass of water after every meal. It swells and gives a feeling of less appetite. I have lost 2 kgs over a period of 2 months.
Exercise, eat healthy!
plenty of exercise
Your body WILL NOT HEAL if you are fasting. The body requires ENERGY and BUILDING materials in order to properly function and HEAL itself...which is a 24/7 job to begin with. Fasting is silly. Ask any E.R. physician.
Juice fasting is not healthy. There is no healing that takes place while fasting.
Funny,but it happens to be 666 minutes.
i didnot understand :(
I don't understand why I have to be this unlucky. My penis is 3.5 inches long when its erect. I took a video of and my penis when its erect, in different angles so that I can see it from another person's perspective. It looked even smaller than it looks to me. It seems like its as long as my pinky finger. I'm really depressed about this. I think I'm gonna die alone

It's not about the size of the instrument, it's about the quality of the user mate
you should use it instead of worring. you can do a loto of nice things...
go to counseling
No, there has never been a product, pill or otherwise, that increases the size of the penis. Would be a controlled dangerous drug if it changed the size of body parts. But loads of such products are for sale. All fake, and possibly unsafe since their ingredients are not regulated.
yes, i got 1 more inch in 1 year :) with the extension device. the enlargement pills dont work, the overall size stays the same.
Not generally, it is just a money scam. The only way to enlarge it is by surgery, and that is painful, and can be unsafe.
LMAO.... kids and your fantasies SMH
no, nothing can change the size.
No. < M
A genius has done all his most important work before he is old enough to vote. A dancer is over the hill at 24. For singers, the magic age seems to be 27. That is to say an awful lot of great singers died in their 27th year. For the average dude, 30 is when you realize you're not a kid any more and haven't been for ten years. For the rest of the world, your opinions are not worth considering to until you are over 30.
Were do you live? I have been places were 46 is average to die from old age. Then there are places were 30 is a young person. At 65 were I live I am thought of as a elder a wise old person. One of the few In America just a senior citizen by a year.
Not anymore. 50 or 60 years ago, people were usually expected to be mature and settled down by the age of 30. These days 30 years olds are still considered young by most people. Even people in their 40's are still young-ish. By the time you hit 50 though, nobody really perceives you as young. On the other hand, I'm 54 and I'm still "me". I still listen to Rock and alternative. I still dress relatively youthful and I'm in pretty good shape. I just have more aches and pains than I used to. Getting older doesn't mean that you have to be a stodgy old man...or woman.
Were do you live? I have been places were 45 is average to die from old age. Then there are places were 30 is a young person. At 66 were I live I am thought of as a elder a wise old person. One of the few In America just a senior citizen by a year.
Considering that most humans in 1st world countries live up till an average of 75 yrs old and you're considered middle age when you reach your 50's isn't 30 still somewhat young? I just find it a joke that youngsters consider someone that's 30 old and what's worse is that some people that were fit and active during their teens and early 20s suddenly take up the lifetsyle of someone in his 70s and become sedentary and become fat and unhealthy.
My mom is going to be 96 soon. Her middle age started when she was 48. How old are your grandparents? Did they live into their 80s or 90s? If so you probably will too. You are just getting started at 30. You have a lot of time to become the person you want to be, to invest in your retirement, to start a life with someone (or not) and to have a wonderful life.
No definitely not. I don't know why most look at ages 30-40 as old when in my opinion I still think it's young. Late 40's and up is considered old to me!
I was putting off going to see a doctor for my mental illness at first. But once you get established with one, they really do know what they are doing and what your trearment might be to live a more stable life. You have to do some of the work yourself. Mind over matter and think positive.
Use your discrimination powers wisely and try to come out of this problem.
Normal blood pressure is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, or 120/80 mm Hg, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). Having a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered high blood pressure or hypertension. normal blood pressure of human body is 120/90, according to this Your blood pressure is high.and You must control Your blood pressure .
No, that is considered hypertension (more than 140 on the top number); you need to be seen to evaluate this. High BP leads to heart problems and stokes.
Depends entirely on where you live Ask local adults for actual info locally as it varies greatly
WOW ;; its way to high see a doc or you will have a stroke sooner than you think
I'm a senior in high school with 2 weeks of school left and I'm in risk of not graduating because I've been missing a lot of school due to my excessive abcenses. My depression and anxiety doesn't allow me to go it is draining me and I am going insane because I don't know what to do I have so many suicidal thoughts. What do I do? How can I seek help for this?
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
Call a hot line or I strongly suggest u go to YouTube and look up changing ing your mind to positive....there alot of meditations. ..don't kill your self n be a coward! Look at it as accomplishment. Start meeting ppl and doing things that u look forward tooo....so what if u might not graduate in 2 weeks....it's not like it's the end? Hello!! Start knowing and believe ing your worth it and u owe yourself only to succeed...cmom....snap out of it.
It takes time for the tampon to absorb blood. Unless I have a seriously heavy flow, my tampons are in for 4-6 hours before I change them. A half hour wasn't long enough for it to get anything on it.
It is normal. It takes a while for the blood to work its way out, and the tampon had absorbed all that was there at the time.
Us period blood might had exhausted , no worry. If the time still remain , it will again flow out. Better use ur pad till time of period ends
perhaps today was a very light day....don't freak out
If you are a man then yes.
it's normal but if it bothers you ask your mom
Yep, it's postural hypertension. I have it too, nothing serious. Maybe go to the doctor and get a blood test to check your iron levels if you're especially worried about it. Also ask your parents and family if you can, you may just have hereditary low blood pressure. If all else fails and you can't find much wrong with it other than it just being an inconvenience, like Ros said, you may just have to stand up slowly. Hope this helped.
As Ros said, low blood pressure when standing up, could partially be due to dehydration. Look up hypotension and see if any factors might be contributing to it, however after long periods of sitting, it's possible to happen to anyone.
Your blood pressure. See your doctor. Or see if you are OK when you stand up slowly from a sitting position.
Postural hypotension. Your blood pressure momentarily becomes too low. Stand up very slowly.
I have slept naked since about 10 years old. At my secondary boarding school it was the custom for all boys to sleep naked and we all got used to it very quickly. It is actually better for you to wear no clothing in bed as it allows you a deeper sleep and your entire skin can totally relax and rejuvenate.
Nude is the most comfortable way to sleep, been doing that since 14. No waistband marks from underwear, and shirts are just plain uncomfortable.
My wife and I have been sleeping nude our whole adult lives simply because it's more comfortable. Not because it's easier to grab each other's body parts. But it does make it nicer when snuggling.
I sleep stark naked it's the only comfortable way to sleep.
Nothin', buddy. "my girl like when I sleep naked because she'll grab my penis and balls during the night." Hey? WHY was this mentioned? LOL
Nothing. Like all the men in my family.
Sometimes naked but usually just my boxers
I sleep in my jeans.
Completely naked.
Yes it is alright as long as you are doing a small volume enema. I have been doing daily enemas for many years now with no side affects.
Yes, plain water enemas are good. They clean the tonixs from colon. Yes, enemas can be used everyday.
No, not for everyday use, You can make yourself ill. You are flushing out essential enzymes and biotic flora that maintain the health of your lower gut. Enemas should only be performed for medical reasons and not on some silly superstitious beliefs that it flushes out toxins.
Daily use is excessive unless you have a medical need to do so.
1. Yes, they are OK.
maybe
NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not just stupid-DANGEROUS!
Yeah, he has major problems, and could be dangerous. Those things are extremely selfish and actually could be signs of a very abusive person. End it now. This is not the kind of relationship you want. You want someone with some kindness and sensitivity, and no weird red flags. Of course, to be with a good person, you have to work on being a good person. Prayer might help you. Hope this helps!
He sounds like a control freak. You need to walk away now
Control; all about control. Wonder why she is his EX wife? Now you know.
It can do, it can worsen existing stress incontinence too,for example after having children a woman will often find she leaks easily after coughing,sneezing or moderate exercise and being obese can worsen this, losing weight would definitely improve that.
Yes
for some people yes it could
It can, but not always.
The stuff works. it's no miracle pill. You still have to do the other 90% of the hard work for this to have much effect.. But I like it because it's not so extreme on the body like other Fat Burners. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea gives me a clean energy boost when I need it, helps suppress my appetite, and gives me those extra deep cuts that I need for my modeling profession
LOL Don't go with number 4....Go and get a gym membership that way there are a lot things you can enjoy. Get one that has a pool, or some favorite classes like Zumba, etc. So you won't get bored with just "exercise".
I am a virgin and 19 yrs old and I've never had any kind of sexual experience before. Well, I am mentally prepared to have intercourse with this guy, but he is HUGE and honestly, my vagina is extremely tight. How can I start preparing physically so that when the day comes with this guy, it doesn't hurt AS MUCH and it fits? Thanks.
Your vagina is meant to "Fit" a baby's whole head through it, so you won't have any problem getting it to fit a penis, no matter what size! There is no way to "Prepare". Just be sure he gives you a pleasurable amount of foreplay. That is all you need.
Don't prepare wait for it if you are tight he will enjoy it more tighter ******* are way better don't sweat it
This is not a real question.
Unfortunately, my friend, you are screwed. That dv/r player is meant to capture penises. On the disclaimer you signed when you bought it, you signed a release about your penis getting stuck. Just cut it off with a playdough knife. Posting it on YouTube would make you famous... DISCLAIMER:DONT DO THIS
Call 911
Guess that depends which you value most : your DVD player or your penis. Either way, you'll probably have to sacrifice one to save the other.
why the **** is your dick in a dvr player in the first place?? I sincerely hope this is a joke... I would suggest you cut your dick off though
Lmao, do you have sex with dvd player?, there's nothing you can't do, you can't go away with it, once a stuck, and it's stuck forever, so marry that thing.
Get used to being part machine for the rest of your life, or amputation
Press eject. Ps: how small is your penis?
Hit reverse.
If it is that small it isn't worth much anyway.
Get a saw and sacrifice one or the other😑
The decision to perform an autopsy depends on state laws and whether there's suspicion that the death was not natural. This decision is generally left up to the coroner. When a person has a heart attack there's several enzymes in the bloodstream that would not occur otherwise. This makes a heart attack easy to confirm as long as too much time has not passed since the event. Based on presence or absence of specific enzymes, a blood draw alone would show that a heart attack occurred. The blood sample could also be used for other purposes such as screening for presence of drugs.
Unless this 35 year old had some terminal disease and was in palliative care, it would be normal for an autopsy to be performed.
Autopsies are SOP for anyone who died when not under medical care.
If someone dies unexpectedly, an autospy would always be done.
I love this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea product. I've tried many things before and the only thing they did was make me grumpy and have a lot of side affects. This though, I have no cravings for junk food, I've been using it for a week and already lost 5 pounds on top of gaining a lot of energy!
No they do not get your heart rate high enough. You need to do cardio exercises or lift weights so that your high rate increases.
They will allow you to burn calories** which will in turn, allow you to lose weight. There's 3500 calories in a pound. You do the math.
sure it will and eating healthy will help too
Eating Greasy Foods often must result into gaining weight . But due to lots of exercise , Yoga and breathing exercise we can avoid health problem . However Prevention is better than Cure.
I eat greasy food I eat all the time fatty and sugary food. Yes from this junk food i haven't any health problem till now but i gain some weight. Now I am planing to say no to all these things. May be in future it become health problem.
As a typical American, I do eat junk food more often than I should. As far as weight gain is concerned, I jog and lift weights so that's never been a problem and at 65 I have no chronic health problems.
I try not to eat greasy foods too often. I will have a cheeseburger 1-2 times a week, they're one of my favorite foods. But because I try to eat healthy most of the time, and because I lift weights, it hasn't given me any problems.
I haven't had a health problem, but weight gained. Greasy foods are really high in fat and calories.
I stopped eating greasy foods because of my weight issues. I always had weight problems since i started eating fast food. Its not a healthy lifestyle trust me. You would be as big as a house. If I were you, plan your meals ahead of time and exercise routinely. Your body will thank you for it later on. and you will feel better physically,mentally and emotionally. I know I do, its worth it and I am sticking to it.
I don't eat greasy foods made with seed oils that are high in trans-fat but I do cook all of my food in butter, and eat bacon too, so I eat a lot of fat and saturated fat. Eating this way (instead of grains and sugar) has actually reversed all of my health problems and have lost weight.
I happen to be a natural low carber. I tried low fat and I was endlessly hungry and I gained weight. For me greasy foods work well. I'm less hungry, have better digestion and so on in a long list of benefits. Different strokes for different folks.
I eat greasy food every day and I've gained weight!
A true atheist will never join any religion.
Actually, atheists are leaders, not followers, not groupies, not congregationalists. I imagine that most or all of the professional religious charlatans are atheists. Your attempt to belittle the atheists is childish.
No, we don't believe in it. We think blindly following an imaginary Deity is crazier.
Nope. We don't ascribe to isms. Thanks though, I believe you have enough members already.
thanks but i will pass
I have a wedding to go to this weekend and I want to look and feel as skinny as possible. I've been trying really hard to restrict my eating and I've exercised every day. But I feel so fat and at certain angles I have a double chin. I just wanna make myself throw up and get rid of any potential whatevers that will make me look even fatter.
I was bulimic for a few years. It didn't make me any thinner. I think I scorched my throat in the process. I much regret it. Wouldn't recommend it. If you can't get the results you're looking for through normal diet and exercise, just don't worry about it.
That's stupid. Sorry to be blunt, but it is. You want to start an eating disorder just for a wedding? If you make yourself sick, it could lead to a full blown condition. Haven't you heard that you actually lose weight faster and SAFER by EATING? Just moderate your portions and calorie intake.
that will never work, I had been a bulimic for 5 years, and I never lost any weight and never became slim, it does not work
The flu is from a virus so antibiotics have no effect on the flu. The main danger from the flu is secondary infection - Some take antibiotics to keep any bacterial secondary infection from happening.
Yes. The vast majority of flu cases resolve on their own without treatment. Also, the flu is a viral infection, and so antibiotics are useless against it.
Most certainly. Antibiotics have no effect on viruses like the flu.
definitely...the flu is viral so antibiotics have no effect on it. if you want to know if people can survive the flu without antiVIRAL medication, the answer to that is also a resounding yes. most people who have the flu do not take an antiviral medication...they just treat their symptoms until the infection goes away on its own.
Antibiotics are NEVER given for flu viruses or for any virus ever
Antibiotics will do nothing for the flu. The flu is a viral illness. Antibiotics kill bacteria and do nothing to viruses.
Yes of course.
if its man-flu? Yes definitely,
Yea youll just be shitty for a week or so, unless your a child, pregnant or are immunoincompitent (AIDS)

Start on a healthy diet and exercise moderately.

Ask your doctor. They will know better than a load of morons on Y!A. You may have an UTI.

Ask your doctor for an interpretation of these results, but it is quite possible that you have a urinary tract infection.
how do you know all those details but not the diagnosis?
No. If you do not learn to express anger in health ways your control will eventually fail and you will explode at someone. At that point you will become an abuser. Learn anger management now before that happens.
No,it is best to talk with the one that discussed and made you angry.If you yell at family for what happened at work ,they will just get angry at you.Just just imaginarily reach into your mind and grasp the anger,pull it out and throw it away and you are heald.
No, get your anger put by exercising, boxing, playing video games, or motorcycling.
yes Iso I can beat my wife with all of the anger I have from the day, I dont want to disappoint her
try writing it down in a journal
Of course no, alcohol is no good
No, it will get you stressed out
Why would that be a good idea?
yes.
It's not a bad prescription for glasses; you are mildly nearsighted, but it is on the high side for a first time prescription and you probably have needed glasses for at least a couple years.
It's relatively mild.

A mild correction for nearsightedness. Welcome to the brotherhood of eyeglass wearers.
i suppose so
Do you think it would if you had sex with girls? Of course not. Masturbation is just solo sex, same physiological act as intercourse. Once a male is sexually functional in early puberty, it is a normal and natural bodily function and has not impact on puberty. If it did, many guys would never mature. Enjoy yourself.
nope, there are no scientific prove of that, but masturbation can cause puberty to come soon by activating the internal glands.
Not at all . Enjoy masturbation without any worries. Regards.
No it doesn't. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. It doesn't effect growth and development in any way.
No I don't think so if anything it might slow the growth of your penis but nothing else would slow down
No. If it did not many of us would have ever made it to puberty... LMAO
No effect... healthy-relationship-dating.com/masturb...
No
no it won't
no, really not
No. Can't rape the willing.
I ran full speed into a teddy bear cholla cactus once and needed help getting pulled out of it. It wasn't rape but it was close. . .

It will definitely work provided you listen to my good words of advice. I mean if you want such wonders or miracles to happen in your real life,you should pray d regularly at least for two minutes daily. Your genuine prayers will never go waste. It will be suitably rewarded by God. Prayer does lot of wonders in your like just like a miracle.

Basically, I really want to be thinner, am 14 years old and a girl. my fiend told the teacher am starving to get skinny. I'm not, I only eat like an apple for breakfast, biscuit for lunch, but I have normal dinner, and a snack after dinner.in total I eat 800-1000 calories a day. I am really scared because the teacher after school informed me, but I just told her I don't get hungry at school. I am scared on Monday she will come in and check what I am eating or will constantly be checking on me now? what do you think the teacher will do?
You're not eating enough calories to be healthy, even though you're eating. A teen needs a minimum of 1500 every day or her body will start using muscle tissue for its energy needs, which is dangerous.
She has to observe you. What if you die of starvation(not saying you will, sounds like you know what you're doing) and your friend tells the officials that your teacher knew and didn't do anything about it.She'll be in big trouble for not helping/reporting you.
after having my son 2 years ago i didn't watch what i ate or exercised and went to 14.7 stone. I now weigh 10.11stone and have lost 4 stone BUT i cant see it...my stomach is still flabby with loose skin, my ar*e is fat and saggy my thighs are huge and i have loads fat rolls still. people say i look amazing and am slim but i cant see it, i look in the missor and still see a fat person. i go to the gym twice a week and eat healthy but the last stone wont come off either...what do i do?
You need to switch up your workout and you need to do toning exercises if you aren't. An hour of cardio a day along with toning every other day(daily if you target different parts each day). Also look at your diet and see what van be improved. If you are unsure ask a professional, most people on here have no clue how to eat right.. Also to that one person, FYI that weight would be obese for me. So yeah, she can be heavy at that weight if she is shorter.
Book an appointment with a therapist. Talking to someone helps with these types of body dysmorphia problems.
i am 13 years old , i am 65 kg and not fat and you have a son and think you are fat with 64 kg?? you are either a troll or a re tard
Tone up at the gym run everyday and eat clean
This Monday I'm getting my infected tooth pulled. I'm terrified but glad I'll finally be getting over it. All this week though, I've started getting scared the infection's spread to my brain. There hasn't been much pain in the tooth, but I have experienced head aches, red eyes, weird oder in my pee, and my fingernail had light green edges at one point, which is gone now. I namely get the headaches in the morning and night, when I'm on my phone. Are these symptoms because of the infection? When I get the tooth pulled will it go away? My moms planning on telling them so I might get antibiotics. But I'm pretty scared.
The antibiotics will clear this up. Its normal to panic and think the worst. Try not to worry. It will be sorted out xxx
Good grief
yes it will
Noooooo in fact you would do the opposite and put on weight. What people don't understand is when the body doesn't receive regular meals or decrease like to one a day. The body goes into shock and stores the food as fat. This is because the body is unsure on when it is going to get its next feed/ source of energy. So by doing what you are thinking of doing you would be doing more damage than good.
Seeing the natural ingredients and that it was caffeine free I got a bad figuring why not. I am not to much overweight and a big tea drinker so I could easily slip it in my normal routine. I was impressed over the increased bowel movements it gave me. I also enjoyed the taste promoting me to keep drinking it simply because I liked the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . Then after a week I noticed weight starting to drop off. I guess all those masses clogging my intestines are finally out of my system. Feels good to be clean inside.
Yes and No ! it depend what you eat ! but its not healthy to eat just 1 meal a day ! Try to eat balance meal and natural food as possible you can for all meals ! Breakfast is a must if you wanna to lose weight ! But make sure "balance meal" (a balance meal mean you have carb,veggie/fruits, and protein in every meal)
No.exercise is important for lose body fat.
No, just eat less at multiple meals, eat more veggies and fruit and nuts, and less processed food. A lot less sugar. Drink more water and tea, not drinks with a lot of sugar or calories.
well, it sounds to me there have to be a better , safer and healthier way to lose weight- given your heart condition... I should strongly and frankly suggest you to get the professional help of a nutritionist-in real life-in your area - someone skilled in treating people of your age... you might deffinitely lose weight ...this way or another... the single essential point is to wisely and gradually rather than precupitously do it...
Intermittent fasting works if you are fat adapted. If you aren't (ie you use carbohydrates for energy) then your body may think that it's starving and keep a hold of fat stores. http://www.dietdoctor.com/lose-weight-us...
That's called the Warrior Diet. It works for some people. It fails most people.
If you have a heart condition it would be best to discuss your weight loss goals with them before making any lifestyle changes. You could go over this eating plan with them - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...
Definitely not
No, it only means that you are a guy with a small penis and not a lot of body hair. Not all men are hung like horses and are hairy beasts. Some are like you. Not a big deal. We're all different.
Not to make you paranoid or anything but you might of just hit it now lol. Or, you're a little girl with a ***** voice and no hair.
No, you hit puberty years ago, just did not get very far.
You have. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
No yo have.
i'm not overweight or anything as i'm about 8st 9 and 5 ft7 butt i eat very healthily in the week to stay in shape! i don't go over 1500 cals a day all throughout the week! but is it okay for me one day of the week to eat whatever i want?? :P on a saturday for example? it wont affect my size will it? thanks! i'm a teen girl by the way! x
Your bmi is an 18.95 which means your normal weight Your not overweight But yeah it's okay to eat what ever you want one day of the week as long as you watch your portions. I calculated your weight in pound since I don't know stones but that is 121 pounds and here in the us for your height that is like the perfect weight I hope you have a good day :))
metabolism's will adapt and therefore slow down to any low calorie plan's so what you need to do is have a treat day just once a week of 500 calories more than usual to reset it then return straight back down to your low limit again the next day,this will create a speed up of a slowed down metabolism with an almost immediate weight loss - its actually a very good idea to set aside just one day a week,every week to do this and by doing so - no more sticking points and a smooth ,steady loss will be a constant result..
Absolutely. Everyone needs a cheat day. One day I cheated SO BAD, and I mean bad...and I lost 2.8 pounds! LOL Trust me, one day won't kill you and will likely IMPROVE your weight loss.
Try keeping busy with relaxing things and focus on controlled breathing. Go outside and walk around, kick back in a lunge chair and listen to some gentle music - whatever you like to do to relax.
That is normal, attend a NA meeting to talk people will reassure you what you're going through is normal and not worth smoking that herb any longer.
No more smoke Ganza
This will pass. See your doctor for help with the anxiety. Ask for a referral to a therapist.
That crap is still choking your system - It will take some time to get rid of it.
Be firm on ur decision,, otherwise u will start again to lose ur health
Go to hell
May I suggest talking to a professional? If you have bad anxiety they can help you with ways to cope with it other than weed. Honestly it's a life saver of you find the right person to talk to. Weed is addicting it just doesnt have really had side effects. But if you want to change its going to be hard and you have to stay strong. You can do this girl I believe in you, I hope this helped a little.
I have both of those. Cognitive behavioral therapy and prescription meds. If you need something more natural try foods that are high in el tryptophan and serotonin. Like turkey, chicken, watermelon, kidney beans and bananas. Searching up foods that help you natural produce these neuralgia smitten swill help a lot. However; know when you need help and don't be afraid to ask a doctor. You don't have to be ashamed. It's not like you have a sign on you, no one else has to know and you will feel so much better in the end.
after a couple of weeks of not smoking things get better Im currently in day 3 of not smoking this time, I've battled with weed on and off for the last 20 years
In the First Ind-China war(French vs Viet-minh), about 600 former Japanese soldiers and officers joined Viet-minh and trained Vietnamese soldiers, provided weapons. In the Second Ind-China war, Japan did nothing.
Not really at all. We used our base on Okinawa as a forward supply depot to a small extent.
They watched it on TV
This week is my first week at the gym. I'm not happy with how I feel so I'm doing something about it. I just hate how I feel at the gym. Being new and starting with lower weights than everyone because it's my first time lifting makes me feel terrible. I also get anxious when I catch people looking at me. I know everyone starts somewhere, I'm just trying to remind myself of that when I'm there
Ego is checked at the door. It took a long time for others to work up the weight, it takes that for everyone. We all start somewhere. Don't worry about it. Have a plan of what you will do every session and go in and do it.
Ohhh just what I have been through...only now all looking at me for other reasons :) and I like it :) So at first it's realy awkward but after a while you start to see result and to feel better and getting more confidence. You will learn how to use right the equipments and you will lift heavier weights... Just give yourself time and don't give you will see result and stop be worried
After I started seeing muscle growth I became more motivated. And no one is watching how much weight you lift. If thats really and issue then you can use more cable machines until you gain strength then start with free weights.
Huge. Large is 6 to 7 inches.
Yes, your penis at 7.5 inches is huge.
No, you should be at least 5 foot.
really cause it seems pretty average
Too much, r u sure and true
I am making cannabis oil for a close friend of mine who has lung cancer. She has been in a lot of pain and wants help managing it in a more natural way. I know there are a couple different ways to make it. I was wanting to know if making it with coconut oil as the solvent would effect potency? Is making it with coconut oil equally as effective as the Rick Simpson alcohol way? It will be taken orally but without food. I am looking to get maximum potency and medicinal results. She wants to eliminate painkillers.
If she wants to eliminate pain killers, then why is she trying to take MCO? It's a pain killer. It's obvious you have no clue what you are doing. It's much better for her to go with what is known, tested, properly dosed, etc. Trust the medical team, not some yahoo on the internet who claims that cannabis cures all. It doesn't.
Go to YouTube for people successful experiences with cannabis oil.
d,l - delta 9 - 3,4 transtetrahydrocannabinol is a fat soluble molecule . I've heard of using alcohol , butter , so I guess coconut oil would work too .
Why are you giving your friend a useless compound made in an untested way by an unlicensed person for a disease in which it will have zero effect?
Pot in any form does nothing for cancer. I feel sorry for all the gullible people who may actually believe this BS
Say it with me: "Modern Medicine is Not Evil." Either go see a reputable oncologist, or just give up completely. Don't waste your energy on garbage that is only designed to relieve you of the burdensome heft of your pocketbook.
The urine of children, teens and adults contains different chemicals and hormones so it would be fairly easy to distinguish between what your urine should contain and what your kids' urine actually contains. If drug testing is compulsory for you then it could be a criminal offence to attempt to pervert the test by using a fake sample.
one might ask why you would be using kids urine?
of course
say no to drugs
Alcohol is a depressant, so obviously you must stop drinking. Weed is illegal for a reason: IT DAMAGES YOUR BRAIN!! Both of those things have damaged your brain which is why you are struggling. Which antidepressant did you take? I've found Zoloft to be the best, but I takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But once your bod adjusts to it you will soon be a healthier, happier person.
Convert everything in order to think clearly. Your struggle will then disappear, vanish or evaporate. I mean. 1) First convert your mind-set 2) Convert your life style. 3) Convert your psychological trend 4) Convert this sentence into a Question. Above all always maintain perfect mental health conditions to avoid such pitfalls in life.
The best thing u can do is just to not care about anyone or anything, sort of become emotionless, i no its not ideal but it will stop suicide thoughts. stop trying to make people proud, stop trying to live up to expectations, stop being a nice person, just look out for yourself. it worked for someone i use to no...
It's the drugs
It is impossible to say exactly when you will have your growth spurt. But a lot of guys your age do have growth spurts by the time they reach high school. So yes, it is very possible.
Nobody knows.
If already 5'7 you are already shooting up, dude.
Really hoping this is a lot of sarcasm! Sprained my ankle last Tuesday running down a hill, I wouldn't want to put anyone through this pain...walking or doing mostly foot related anything hurts! And it's a very lengthy process of recovery 😂 Seriously dude stop
Believe me. Coming from a person who is on their 6TH WEEK OF RECOVERING FROM A SPRAINED ANKLE.... you don't want to sprain your ankle. Go read a book or some $hit.
Guys really? Come on!! Don't answer this! You need to not hurt yourself on purpose for any reason. An injury now can weaken parts of the ankle in the future. 1 more thing. How ****** up are you right now.
I ve had those same feelings, too, but don t do it to get out of something. Sprained ankles are seriously dangerous, you can either rip a muscle or break a bone.
So, you are trying to get out of doing something, so a sprained ankle is a good excuse, eh? It is difficult to inflict a sprain on yourself because it could really backfire and cause broken bones. Not an intelligent thing to do. Because broken bones cost thousands to fix and may give you months if not years of pain and constraints.
No you don't, trust me. I've sprained each ankle numerous times and even chipped a bone in one. It's extremely painful and your ankle will never be the same again.
Absouketly don't do that. If it needs to sprain it'll sprain on its own!
Don't worry you aren't crazy. I have been in the same situation and yes they do hurt but if you are willing to do it despite that then jump off a table or on a trampoline in heels. If the table idea, put pillows around. And maybe off your bed. Since you want to do it in your room.
I'm 13, I am a virgin so I know it isn't an std. I have a weird bump on the skin towards the outside of my...area... It is about the size of a blueberry and I'm too nervous/scared/awkward to tell my mom. I'm a girl. It really hurts, I have had it for about 2-3 days now...any ideas as to what it is?? I need answers ASAP
It's a cyst or "zit"... an ingrown hair or else a particle of dirt or something got into your pore. This can happen to any of us, and it does, and it has happened to most of us. Guys even get them at times. Nothing wrong with telling your Mom.... she is there to help you and take care of you. She's a woman too and i'm sure that, during the course of her life, she's had a cyst or two herself.
It sounds like a infected hair follicle or ingrown hair. Put a hot pack on it several times a day. It may pop and leak fluid.
Sounds like an ingrown hair. I wouldn't worry about it. You can always squat and take a photo and then edit so someone can look.
Hello! I am a doctor. I recommend you to talk to your mom and to talk to a doctor who can see what it is... maybe it is an infection and it need to be drained... if you don`t do that maybe it can be worse later... other questions my email is jadecameronmd@yahoo.com
why not ask your mom
The postpartum hormones are probably increasing your OCD symptoms. It might be helpful to see a counselor, therapist, or psychologist to talk through your anxieties and think of some strategies/exercises you can do to help you feel less fearful. They may suggest anti-anxiety medication, but you don't have to go that route if you don't want to.
You are a mother. I major thing has changed in your life. It is normal to freak out and think oh what if this happens or that. You are a mother bear and you are worried about your cub. It is the early stages of motherhood.
Yellow semen- sperm can't be seen without a microscope. Sounds like some urine was left in your urethra and it is mixing with semen when it comes out. Urinate before masturbating, and then "strip out" the urethra with your thumb and finger all the way from the base below the balls to get out any last drops.
That's a sign that your not drinking enough water, start the day off each morning by drinking 12 oz. of clear tap water and continue drinking a glass full every 2 hours throughout the day. This should clean your system out.
nothing wrong with it.some people have yello colour. it depends what you eat.If eat onions and garlic and curry powder which is yello turmerick powder then the colour will be yellow. If you masturbate 4 times you will see the colour will change to white and it will be thin as well. so all good do not worry. it has not been used.so play safe it will be good. Your diet makes the colour.
yellow sperm is cool if you never get any pussy but if you are shooting yellow **** and you have been getting off on the regular (in other ways) you may have an std.
Semen can vary in color depending on what you eat or drink. It can normally go from nearly transparent to white, off white, slightly yellow or even pale green at times.
if its yellow see a doctor as that means something could be wrong . See a doctor asp to make sure theres nothing serious .
To make it clear, you ejaculate yellowish s.emen and, some guys may have those since semen is subjective to health, if you smoke or not, some guys have almost milk semen others have whitish or near clear, some semen are sticky others have liquidy. But if your semen becomes more yellow, you should seek assistance from the doctor.
Mine is too sometimes. I've looked into it, and it seems it is normal, should be ok. Next time you have a checkup, can't hurt to mention it to doc to see what he/she says. But I think the other replies here are spot on.
of course, that's the colour it get when you don not getoff often; but often its colour is not pure white, it depend on hydration, food ecc. ecc. must jackoff for some days before it return white. and no, cancer has nothing to do with that.
Not necessarily - if the beer 🍻 a day isn't affecting your life dramatically then wouldn't worry about it too much however, if you think you may not be able to handle it control the drinking 🍻in the future 🔮 then sure why not
No. When you start drinking a 12 pack all yourself..then go.
You should stand in the queue and wait till your turn comes. And then consult the Doctor.
If you feel you MUST have that beer, maybe you should
Are you a member?
no.
You need to relax your muscles. That's all that makes you tight. If you're expecting pain, you'll be tense, that's understandable. Given that a baby can get out, a finger isn't going to hurt, is it?
Relax. I was a virgin until I was 32, and Yes, I am extremely small, can't even get through a Pap smear. So relax, it will get better.
See a gynecologist. You could have an imperforate hymen, which would need to be cut surgically and then everything will work fine.
then forget about it, you know you're not ready so just let it go....by insisting, you are just giving yourself a hard time....
Talk to your doctor. Good luck!
Not a whole lot. 4 miles a day is pretty worthless.. I mean result to effort is slim. You are better off doing 10(100yd sprints) 5(50yd sprints) and Bear Crawling 100 yards. doing high intensity interval training is so much better than running 4 miles a day. Alot less Result to effort is 3 to 2 Overall much healthier. I mean of course you can walk long distance. Couple this with less than 100g of sugar you are good bro.
That would depend on genetics and your diet, etc.
Depends on your diet.
Its hard to say
Maybe you have sitted for a long time, this may make your testicular numb, if you want to get some treatment, you could try some Chinese herbs, such as Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill, because your problem is not serious, and this therapy is natural with no side effects
How come. Is it a mystery. Your question confuses my mental concentration. My brain takes me to a wrong and darker areas. You should be extra careful while experimenting such misadventures. It may be sucked inside by unscrupulous elements or mischief mongers. You should not act smart before any powerful opponent.
I wouldn't worry about it as I am sure they will feel normal in a while. Most guys don't realize the workout your nuts get as you masturbate. If you watch videos of guys masturbating you will see their nuts bouncing to extremes as the guy masturbates.
You're weak
You're empty
You can book a time by calling in however, when you arrive their they may ask for Medicare cards or signatures and I'm not too sure if they might ask you how old or something or if you would be able to give them these but it doesn't hurt to give it a go. Btw I'm from Australia so I don't know if you have the same system we have here
In the UK you can and I'm certain in the US they have free clinics available for teens. In the UK you just need to make sure they don't send a text reminder to your parents just ask at reception =]
why not get another family member to take you than
Yes in the UK. and I agree about the text message,
Yes, you can. They will see you on your own from15.

Nothing wrong, I think. There are just so many types of breasts, you wouldn't believe it. In fact, you can believe me ... because we used to have topless fashion at our beaches for many years. The only types that are not normal are those big round things that some have had made, and that maybe even more think they are supposed to have. I'm sure your breasts are absolutely fine. Nothing wrong from what are writing here at least ;o)
No there is nothing wrong. I've grown up with households full of women. Everyone is different. Every boob is different some have big nipples and some have small. My brother has little slits that never even pop out. Every one also matures at a different weight as well. You'll be fine trust me! It's just a part of growing up!
I'm not sure there's much wrong health-wise, but if there is a potential for them to grow, taking estrogen hormones would do the trick. However, you should consult a doctor if you want to start taking hormones. It may also be that your body does not naturally produce enough estrogen, in which case there might be a uterine issue, but if there are no other side effects it's unlikely.
you sound healthy and fine, other then having bad luck with genetics. breast development has everything to do with where your body stores fat as well as genetic makeup. have you looked at your fathers side of women? they may be smaller and you may have taken after his side. However! boobs grow all the time during a woman's lifetime! they change with hormones, pregnancy, weight gain and loss. your still young and have plenty of time to grow and boobs do not stop. at 16 i was a 36C i am now 25 and a 32DDD but genetics on my moms side were short 5,1 and big busted.
yes, there is a hormonal imbalance in pregnancy and then the daughther is born with that predisposition to have tiny bags. consult as physician, there is hormonal medication for ladys to make their things grOOw :) there are surgical ways for augmentation, that surgery is more sophisticated by now for the bags to look gorgeous ♥ but that is not for now, because they can grow for a year more. if they still are so tiny in a year or two, then its time for an augmentation but only if there is a future husband, else a lady doesnt need to.
it really just depends on your genetics are set up for your body shape. You may or may not be done growing.. some people genetically grow pretty early and are done at 16/17, some take a little longer. as others stated, the nipple only protrudes when you're cold or aroused
4 regular water bottles

half your weight in water 70oz at least a day so 4-5 bottles minimal at least.
You should be drinking two to three quarts of water a day, more if it is very hot where you live or if you are very active.
5 liter is usually enough
I have tried a lot of products however I love this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product as I don’t get the jitters that I have experienced with other. I also like it for the energy it gives me to last the day. On top of this I have lost a few pounds without changing my diet in the first month. Can't wait to see the results at the end of the second month .
Eat right and exercise daily. 30 minutes minimum, and try and have it be as intense as possible.
yeah, you sure do, but will you listen? educate yourself here [[ http://www.earthclinic.com/cures/kidney_... ]] there are plenty of options for you out there. you just need to learn how to search properly.....so read and learn, and soon you'll be armed with all kinds of self help info that won't make profits for any doctor...but they forget, Hippocrates said, "Let food be thy medicine, and Let medicine be thy food" that's the father of modern medicine, so why do the doctors never ask what you eat and only prescribe drugs? eh? a doctor will never give you permission to heal yourself, cuz there is no profit in that for him....get it?! you have a lot to read, better get going....
When you go to dialysis, the nurse will check your blood to see how your diet is affecting you. She will be able to tell if you are eating to many of the wrong foods. She also will tell you or give you a list of food to avoid. You can read about this here: https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/diet...
well i have stage one liver and kidney cancer and thankfully i don't need any of that but when i first saw the doctor i asked like loads of questions and you should do the same
Call your doctor------they will give you an idea of what to eat, what to avoid. We out here, CAN'T DO THIS.
you should be talking to your DOCTOR about diet
Ask your doctor dont they tell u
I was driving down the road with my car window down and there was this guy I front of me smoking weed and he blew smoke out of his window and the wind blew the smoke to my car behind him! And I don't know if I inhaled any smoke or not! Help? Did I get high at all? Does the smoke go away once it hits fresh air? Did I inhale any THC??
It disappeared into the wind...no you did not get high off of it.
Lol, you probably inhaled a miniscule amount, not enough to enter your blood stream though.
You would not have inhaled enough to have the slightest effect on you.
Been many times. It's not a big deal... it's kinda like being in a regular hospital but you wear your own clothes and instead of going for X-rays you have group therapy..... You should be able to visit him and there are phones he can use to call out and that you can use to call him... they don't always get answered because the nurses don't answer them... the patients do. Seriously.... it's just starting a new med and lots of therapy. Goals, Cognitive Behavior Therapy, Group Therapy, Art Therapy, Mindfulness, Music, Reflections.... Exactly what will depend on the hospital but he'll be fine.
I have been to a mental hospital. Nothing bad happens there, and in fact it's a very comforting atmosphere (at least, the one I went to) They will give him therapy and medication most likely, but nothing bad. It's natural to be worried but he is probably very safe there
Near me, they go to daily classes and have "free time" which is basically art class. They also have group and individual therapy. Most people I have spoken to haven't benefited from in. In fact they say its the exact opposite. They've actually said its fun...
They boil them in oil. Get a new boyfriend
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
I feel it too. I just broke up with my boyfriend. Know and remember you are not alone.
time will heal you. friends will come. if you can, I would stop hurting yourself, the scars are not good and may even scare friends away. join a club or group. friends will come. best of luck.
Go to counselling
Bro. I am here to help. please reply to this answer so I can try to help you. I am just 1 year older than you.
I usually cut, that isn't going to change, but now it is summer (For me) I need somewhere to cut that isn't so noticeable and easier to hide. I assume the best option would be my legs, but I would know where, thighs? Ankles? Anyway any help would be appreciated, I also understand I shouldn't cut so please don't tell me I shouldn't and its bad to do, because I know this, it just helps. Thanks in advance! (I'm 16 and depressed)
I would suggest talking to a therapist and see if they can help you but I understand that no one on here is going to be able to make you stop so a good place would probably be high enough on your thighs that no one would see if you wore shorts (if you like wearing shorts). If I thought I could convince you that you shouldn't cut, I would, but some stranger on the internet won't convince anyone.
Self harm is a symptom of depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
i am currently in recovery from self harm and the best thing i can say to you is to please find someone to help you stop. I know how hard it is, i really do, but getting help for it was the best thing i could have done. I starting cutting when i was your age and it took me 5 years to finally stop and now im left with a lot of scars that im ashamed of. Self harm is an addictive thing and if you dont get help now, it will continue to get worse. Please seek help, and stay strong love
Depression is a result from ignorance. If you want to do something with your life and stop the pain talk to you parents, and if they can't help, talk to a priest. If you still want to waste your life and cut yourself, please continue on your wrist, so others can see and try and help you.
Maybe cut the idea of cutting?
Destroying yourself is not the best option, moron. You need nourishment. Eat lots of nourishing food and not much garbage. Half of what you eat should be fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables, the other half split between proteins and complex carbohydrates such as whole grains. Eat only small amounts of fatty, sugary, salty, highly processed foods. Fill up on that first group. Try to not be a complete moron.
um, you don't. i was bulimic for almost a year because of that and its extremely bad for you. your hair will fall out, you wont be able to stand up without nearly falling over, your teeth will literally start rotting. just stop where you are and learn to love yourself. if not, then just be careful what you eat and learn how to read and feed yourself by a nutrition label.
purging will destroy your esophagus and throat and put you on a stomach feeding tube for life
Rather see a bush down there than smooth, bush is natural. Maybe trim a bit at times but not shave.
I just do a trim. My husband would like me to shave, but he loves ME more so he doesn't want me to be constantly itchy and uncomfortable. He's a great husband.
don't shave. at least you can trim them, but never shave
I have been type 2 diabetic for about 5 years and doctor advised me not to use sweeteners as it interacts with diabetic medication but my blood sugar levels are always good as I follow a healthy diet and do exercise and I still take a teaspoon of sugar in my tea/coffee
You could use that saccharine stuff like the Sweet-N-Low brand. They banned it for a couple decades over some idea that it causes cancer, but it's back now. Splenda and NutraSweet (sucralose and aspartame) are both suspected of causing pre-Alzheimer's conditions and metabolic problems. Stevia leaf extract is expensive and not everyone likes it, though it can work in small amounts. Truvia is a branded blend of stevia and sugar alcohols. You can see more about sugar alcohols and other info on the link below.
try to avoid any of the synthetic sweeteners! I use regular sugar myself. My daughter uses Truvia and others use Splenda! a little real sugar is much better than eating potatoes, pastas, milk products, legumes, etc.
Stay away from all artificial sweeteners. Even organic stevia can cause stomach issues. I like organic coconut palm sugar. It still has to be used in moderation.
Trevia
Broccoli. Not an answer you expected but definitely an answer you need to know.
all are good EXCEPT Aspartame
We're both highly attracted to each other...every time we hang out there's sexual tension...and we're both bored. He's not the typical guy, he's incredibly intelligent, always tries to make me happy, puts my feelings first... So we're going to hook up. At first he was hesitant when he found out I'm a virgin, but now he's cool with it. What should I expect? Is it going to hurt? We will be drinking so maybe i won't be so tense..
Well do you know his penis size? It could hurt if it's big. It didn't hurt my girl friend at all but tbh, mine is pretty small only 4 inches! :)
It may or may not hurt, it just depends on your genetics. I think that sounds fine, just make sure he's wearing protection. Like seriously. And have fun I guess.
get a plan B pill is you can enjoy him c*ming in you and not get prego. its the best feeling when a guy c*ms in you. it will hurt for alil while and sometimes girls dont hurt. take your time at first
Ask a doctor. You say you lost your left eye, then you say it is small. Can you see anything with that eye?
The eyes are the only organ that doesn't grow since en utero. They were the same size then as they are now.
There are probably things that you can do, but you really need to talk to a specialist, a doctor who understands your situation, and who will be able to explain the options available to you.
no i cant see
It is NOT legal to have current driver licenses in multiple states at once. Your one and only one driver licenses should be from the state you actual LIVE in.
State laws differ, but, in general, you cannot possess two different state's driver's license at the same time. Normally, you need to be licensed in the state that you are considered to have permanent residency in and that license would be good to use throughout the United States to drive as long as it's valid.
i got arrest for that once. so i dont think so. what happened was i moved to utah. while i was in utah my texas DL got suspended for tickets or something, i never found out. so i came to visit my parents and i was driving around and i got pulled over and i showed them my utah drivers liscense and they took me to jail.
no.
Just a simple yes or no and explanation please. Or tell me how I can lose the weight fast. Im 17, male and weigh 11 stone at 5'8'' I've only been eating dinner the past couple of days in hope that I will lose weight as I really want to be much more tone and have a flat stomach for my holiday as I am very self conscious. I'm doing like 90 sit ups and crunches and 90 sec planks everyday and dumbell stuff too. Will this help lose weight or only make it look bigger?
No. Stop being a moron. Food isn't optional, it's a need. Half of what you eat should be fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables. The other half split between protein and complex carbohydrates such as whole grains. Eat only small amounts of fatty, sugary, salty, highly processed foods. One meal a day puts your body into starvation mode, were it tries to hold on to fat.
I lost 10 lb since I started drinking Weight Loss Green Store Tea product !! of course you have to be conscious of it and not eat as often if your body tells you youre not hungry. If you keep eating the same amount, whats the point? but you will not feel as hungry and I stand by it
Eat a well balance diet with fruits, veggies and plenty of protein. Go to the gym and get plenty of exercise.
Do exercise, sweat like hell. Run with a garbage bag worn as a shirt, under a shirt that will make you sweat
No, normal bodily function to ejaculate and the average teen ejaculates at least once daily; most adult males do it 3-5 times a week once past their 20s. You ejaculate semen by the way, sperm is just a tiny component of what your semen is made up of. Sperm is also microscopic so is invisible without a microscope.
yes you soon will run out of it u body is not making enough and u are wasting too soon this will give u weak penis and weak erection and u can not have sex it will cause lot of other problems so u better to stop now playing with it before it is too late
Your penis might temporarily become less erect, and the orgasms won't be as good, but it will recover after you stop. Other than that, not really.
I think you referring to yourself. If you refer others the answer is no. If it concerns you , I think it is on the higher side . Make your habit of jacking off every alternate day so that you can enjoy well . regards.
yes you will become weak and feel sleepy all day better shake the penis once a week
What is your question anyway? What you ask makes no sense.
Yes, it dies. If you mean "is there any effect on you" = No. > M
No
does it matter
more health
"rendered" means provided or given So it is simply asking where was the treatment given.
To what part of the body was the treatment administered? Like a foot or leg.
It means what treatment was given for the condition, and where did that treatment take place.
rendered, given you could also say, administered...
they want the name of the hospital
You are underage and probably won't qualify for a medical marijuana card.
You should be seeing a counselor, therapist or your illnesses, dude. Weed doesn't solve those problems.
I am sure a doctor wouldn't agree with you, but you can discuss it with him on your next appointment.
I don't think so young blood,but I could recommend yoga.
gotta be 18 +
go to a physician and see if he can prescribe you anti-anxiety and anti-depression pills. y'know... LEGAL drugs that are meant for that. smh
ask ur local drug dealer
You failed at trolling :/
Where have you been gettig it?
.
i think i may have a UTI but i really don't want to go to the doctors because i've told my mum i'm not having sex, but i am and i think thats probably what i've got it from. I've had it for about three days now and have noticed some blood aswell :S. Will it go away without seeing a doctor? Thankyou.
A Urinary tract infection (UTI) will not go away. Go to your doctor. He will run a culture to confirm that it is a UTI..That means you pee in a cup, and he sends it to the lab. Usually takes 2 or 3 days. Meanwhile drink more fluids. More water, and cranberry juice helps. That usually is why many people get UTI's. It has nothing to do with sex. You should just drink more fluids. A quick cure is "cipro". The doctor will prescribe the pill, take 2 a day for 7 days.
Don't be afraid to go to the doctor. A person can still get a UTI without even having sex. Go to the doctor, and no one will even know you had sex. Plenty of women get their hymen broken by things other than sex. Like that darn "bar" on a bicycle, if you land on that ! Anyway, do not delay because it could go up into your kidneys, and you could get a kidney infection which is even worse. They only very rarely go away without treatment !
Infections will only get worse without treatment. I would visit a doctor to make sure your infection is not serious.
If it is a bacterial infection it will not go away on its own. If it isn't then it will. Only way to tell is to pee in a cup and the doctor will let you know if you need the meds or not. They usually send away the pee to test it too.
u may try herbal tea which helps with infections (can be bought at specialized pharmacies), or amoxicillin which is a antibiotic used in such cases. the best to do is go see a doctor without your parents knowing about it, just to be sure for your own self
A UTI will not go away. You need to go to the doctors but you can drink some cranberry juice. My mom always told me how to avoid UtI is to urinate before and after sex.
Yesh
No
NO!
3 to 5 times is average.
The FDA hasn't decided on a daily recommended allowance yet...
at least 5
TRUMP
That's how big mine is and I'm 28. Yes it's a small penis but yours should get bigger.
If you're a late developer, it might have some more growth yet to come. But really, girls don't worry about it nearly so much as guys. Penises and vaginas can't love one another; only people can. Btw, a ***** is only 4" deep.
The more you think about it, the more you will stress. Why worry about stiff like that? Worry about your education. The decisions you make now may vastly affect the salary you earn in the future. Most of my friends ended up fathers before 19, and that meant dropping out of collage. I will admit that I was sexually active, but I was very carefull about it.
Yes you will grow until your late teens to early twenties.
Youre just stressing yourself, it is what it is but hopefully youll gain more since your 15 and your still in puberty. Theres nothing we can do to lengthen our gear. What will matter for girls is how you pleasure them.
Most likely it will not grow. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Should be a pretty good fit for a 15 yr old girl. < M
It can still grow into your late teens. So there is still a chance.
Yes it should but it does not take to much to make a girl satisfied.
Hopefully it will grow some more this year.
The loss of a mother can be devastating. Pile on the loss of other family members and you can feel abandoned. Since you don't have a close personal relationship with your dad, that makes it worse. What you are doing is trying to substitute a boyfriend for the close feeling you need from your mom and/or dad. You can't do that. For one, you will suffocate that boyfriend by needing too much from him. That will chase him away. You need to talk to a psychiatrist about the unresolved feelings regarding your mom (and other people who have died.) Once you resolve these feelings, you can have a normal, healthy relationship with a guy...maybe even your father.
Depression and anxiety are very common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. Its the best antidepressant and it has no side effects. You will soon be healthy and happy. Find a big happy church, attend a youth group and have fun. Talk with the pastor/minister. Where else can you get counseling for free?
Okay, if it's over a boy, then you're just another dumb a** girl. Moving on. Idiot.
Inteveral training on the treadmill is one of the best exercises you can do for cardio because it keeps your metabolism running for the longest amount of time, even up to 24 hours. However, remember that weight loss is rooted mainly in what you eat. In fact, I just loss 6 pounds ovver the past 2 weeks only by eating under a certain amount of calories each day (fitbit is tracking everything for me) although I did do a little walking. So if you do all that working out, don't mess it up by eating a bunch of calories on top of it. The wrong foods or too much food can cancel out your whole workout.
It's enough but make sure your diet is on point. Eat the right foods and eat the right amounts of it. Usually I don't eat more than 1800 calories. 70% of losing weight is actually diet. If you jog for 1 hour yet you eat a lot of food it will be completely useless. Goodluck!
It sounds like you are looking for immediate weight loss. This does not happen. If you keep up this routine over a period of time you will lose some but it will be a slow process.
Please know that muscle weighs more than fat so to get on the scales a lot is going to discourage your target. When working out, don't count anything. No sets, reps or time. A true workout every other day means repeating a movement until you can't stand to do it one more time. Riding a pedal bike until you throw-up, literally. "Counting" sets, reps and time is self defeating and you set your self up for failure. Good luck. Don't forget to stretch out before and after.
If you're worried about it being selfish make masturbation videos and pass them out to everyone.
I think there are those who think it's selfish. To those people I say, don't masturbate. There is nothing wrong with masturbating. It's a lot safer than contracting AIDS, HIV, STD's, or getting someone pregnant
Well, duh! Masturbation is self sex! It is a selfish act... to pleasure yourself. And that is normal! And also... Masturbation is not an act of love. It's nothing more than self pleasure. Like soaking in a hot tub... Or drinking your favorite beverage... or kicking back listening to music ... Or anything else you enjoy doing solo . Not sure why you're freaking out about this. It's completely pointless.
I chalk it up to BS too. No it is not Selfish, it is self gratifying.
No, of course not. For many of use, it's impossible to make "love" with others this way because no one want me/you.
I started eating green beans and broccoli a lot more because they have these "Steam Bags" that you put in the microwave and in 5-6 mins its done. I eat the WHOLE bag for a meal, (4 servings) 35 calories per serving 5g carbs per serving (are these good carbs or bad carbs?) 2g sugar per serving 0 Fat 0 cholesterol I say this is okay, even 4 servings. But hey, too much of anything is bad for you, right?
Is that the only thing you eat all day for each meal? Because that wouldnt be healthy. Sure broccoli is good and everything but you also needs your different types of nutrients. Like protein, iron, vitamin A, C, D etc. If that's all you eat your body is not getting all the nutrients it needs. And you need atleast 2,000 calories a day. Try eating the broccoli with salmon, or steak, or maybe chicken breast. You always need a balanced meal to stay healthy with some sort of exercise.
Hah no your good. You should be having 8 servings of vegetables a day! So eating that only puts you at about half way! Eat up:)
This is very very good. But you could save a lot of money by just buying veggies and steaming them. you need a pot and a "steamer". and after the water is boiling - it takes 4 minutes. You could also control the size of your servings better. and ou can use other things besides brocoli and great beans. but broccoli is the best.
Yes i think you ever chance of growing too 5ft 9in you can grow past your predicted height of 5ft 6in most people do only very few never grow too anywhere near their predicted the lucky ones grow too their predicted the very lucky ones grow past their predicted height Justin Bieber was only supposed too only grow too 5ft 4in but he ended growing too 5ft 7in you don't need too lose hope everybody is different if you grow too 5ft 9in it will be a miracle.
Not likely, you are more likely to be 5f 6 or 7. Your genes are probably short going by your family and height is 80% genetic. The other 20% is diet but you can't suddenl;y pick up good food and grow...you need it constantly from birth. It only maximises your height too, it can't exceed your genetic potential.
Can a footballer reach 7'? Can a porn actor reach 11"? Can a teacher know all the subjects? Can I become a model? Just because it is my wish? Do you think someone is interested in your so called 'goals'? Grow up! Exercise and food is great for life. It does NOTHING for growth
I'm taller than everyone in my family and taller than the other guy name hake on here.( hi Jake). I'm 6'5 and everyone is older than me are now younger and little than me because I'm the biggest jkjk but I am the tallest tho You can exercise like play basketball. Eat really healthy and drink a lot of milk. Stay slim and in shape. Get plenty of 8-9 hours of sleep. These tips are really going to boost your height in 1 year.
Im taller than EVERYONE in my family (mom dad, siblings grandparents) excpet my great uncles who are 6'3" each. I am 5'9" and the doctor said i have a couple grow spurts left. Also im 15 so yea you probally can
yes you can easily grow 5"9 if you do daily exercise for 15-20 minutes daily basis, do running, cycling, play basket ball .
Yes
Genetics surely do impact the height, but exercise and diet is most important. playing basketball and doing back stretching can help, Milk and Bananas are known to help, although that's not scientifically proven but we all know they both strengthen and grow the bones. Squats can make you shorter! and don't carry heavy weights. and u can watch this video for more info https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXFzPvkH7OQ
Sorry, but I don't think it will happen. Not without human growth hormone, and no reputable doctor will give that to you just for cosmetic reasons.
You build your body. A cat is made of air, water and cat food. If you're really going to pursue this, get a book about nutrition. Yes, a book. There are details and a narrative that you can't put into a video or blog. If you don't, Bill from marketing lives down the street from you and he's working on spining this herb into a pill and dvd set. I'll take your money but if you actually want to gain weight, you have to know what you're doing and why.
Protein! Protein! Protein!
Eat food.
you wont beef-up to 150lbs you beef-up to 250lbs, eat lots of meat and your insulin will build you up
Whats a growth spurt? When does it happen? What exactly changes about the body? What should i do to advance my growth spurt? Like eating and taking vitamins and etc. What kind of lifestyle should i have to help my growth spurt? What can i do to reverse the damage i created from smoking weed? Im a 16 year...5'5 male who has two brothers that are 6'0 and 6'2 and im kinda overweight
First, most guys don't get growth spurts- they just gradually grow to their final adult height over several years. Second- nothing you can do to impact your final height, it is all genetics that control how tall you will get. Being overweight won't impact your height but not a given you'll be as tall as your brothers either. Could have different dominant genes for height than them. Ask them when they grew the most and when they stopped, as your growth will most closely resemble theirs. Not sure you'd cause any "damage" from smoking weed either. Other than to your brain.
You cannot make yourself have a growth spurt. There's nothing you can do about that. Not all boys have growth spurts. Some just grow gradually over time. A growth spurt can happen at any time, with no notice. Or it may not happen at all.
Yes unfortunately mental illness is very real . You should go and see a doctor who could help you .
Yes, mental illness is real. I have anxiety and I know it's real.
Is your mother smarter than the entire American Medical Association? They have declared that Depression is a disease that responds well to medications and therapies just like any physical disease. And so, would your mother tell you that diabetes, asthma and Parkinson's disease is not real and can't be "proven"? Your mother's remarks verge on verbal and emotional abuse.
Your mom is not smart. Yes, they are real. Don't listen to her.
Your life does suck. I'm going to be brutally honest. But killing yourself is never a way out. I know you feel like you can't do it. That there's no words that could possibly pull you through. That no one cares. I'm going to tell you right now that if you start taking control of your life despite your circumstances, you will live that amazing life. Your not going to be thus age forever. Your going it be an adult one day. Your going to be able to make your own decisions. Make your own money. Please don't let this affect your life as an adult. Stay away from drugs and stay educated !!!
Honestly you just cant sit around feelimg sorry for yourself life is what you make it if your sisters wants to make nothing out of their lifes thats on them and they'll get the consequences one day when your parents can't support there bad habits you just got to focus on your life and what your going to do but at the end of the day there your family so no matter what they do love and support them because tomarrow isn't promised to nobody
No, but you should have some support outside your home to get away from the negative things that bother you. Call a crisis line and talk with them . They even have special teen crisis lines for youth. The numbers are usually free. Also your school should have a counselor to address these issues with.
Sometimes life deals you lemons, and when it does, make lemonade. If you don't like them, move out, and create a better life until you're better and less resentful and hateful. Btw, you may be looking at them all wrong, because at your age, you still have a lot to learn about life . . .
I'm sorry that you are dealing with difficult circumstances, it sounds like it's been going on for awhile now. If you are not able to talk with your family, please consider meeting with your school counselor or other trusted adult to problem-solve. If you are feeling suicidal, please reach out to a suicide prevention hotline to take advantage of the prevention resources available to you. There are people willing to help you through these challenging times. TL, Counselor
I suffer with acne and i've actually in the past used moisturizers that have been too heavy and made my acne worse so now what i use to make sure it's not too heavy is a mist/spray moisturizer, it's light and i prefer to use them so i know i won't end up using one that's going to add to my acne. Plus they're usually not very expensive (it depends on where you live) and you can easily get them online!
Scrub oily residues with these pads and then you can use any moisturizer. Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Get a lotion called bevoline by skin divine. I've tried all acne treatment brands that you can think of, I've also tried all kinds of home remedies and diets and nothing comes close to this lotion;)

Nicole this is still you even though you changed your name. No if all you ever do is post this on yahoo over and over instead of seeking help for your multiple issues it is not likely that your situation will improve.
You need to admit to your parents about everything that's going on. They love you no matter what it seems like. I was a teenager who had to run away most days from my house to either a friends or sleep at school because my dad is an extremely aggressive drunk. He isn't anymore and I'm proud to see the real dad I knew before. But let them know whats up, and ask for counseling. You aren't taking a final exam. You can ask for help, and it's okay. It works too.
Take a walk/jog to get fresh air, be around friends/family who love you, do activities you enjoy, etc. Depression can be a really difficult thing to go through, just know that you're not alone and there are people to support you. I wish you all the best and hope you'll be alright. Xx
1) First of all you should forget your Ego and ego-centric desires. 2) Join Yoga and meditation classes and learn all their techniques systematically. In Yoga classes, they teach lot of physical exercises and some mental exercise also in order to keep your body and mind always fit, trim and strong. Then you can easily deal with such tough and difficult situations. 3) In any case I suggest that you deal with these problems firmly, efficiently and effectively.
lots of beer
You get a toothbrush, and get some toothpaste, here's the hard bit, you pull the lid off the toothpaste and squeeze it, a white creamy thing should be on your brush, lift it up to your mouth and brush your teeth
Brush for 2 minutes . brush for 30 seconds in each quadrant
take the brush with toothpaste and place within your teeth and brushing it for about 3 minutes,,
With a toothbrush, tooth paste and water... You put the toothpaste on your brush and then move the brush side to side, I know it's rocket science
Use a squirrel. Preferably a fresh one as opposed to those frozen squirrels. Pain in the *** to thaw in time...
With a bottle of Jack ;)
Mouth wash will do
with a toothbrush and toothpaste
to keep them clean
First off, I'm slim thick, not fat at all. I have a nice toned body except for my boobs. I have natural 34dd's & they just aren't attractive to me. When I used to play soccer I didn't wear a supportive bra & my weight has fluctuated. My nipple don't point to the ground but they aren't high up at all. It's just annoying because they don't look good without a bra & if I go swimming I have to tie my bathing suit really tight. I'm so insecure about them. How can I make them not saggy? I'm only 17!
Yeah you really should have been wearing a sports bra during sports activities to avoiding damaging the natural support. At other times try to go bra-less when possible to exercise the natural support. Taking 3,000 mg MSM (organic sulfur) feeds the high sulfur proteins that make up the natural support, or you can eat lots of foods rich in connective tissue such as skin or tendon. Working your pectoral muscles, which are underneath the breasts, can help push them forward and upward though it doesn't actually help your natural support. That is connective tissue.
You kinda gotta play the hand you're dealt. If you're loaded I guess cosmetic surgery is an option. But if you're worried about what guys are going to think, you're worrying over nothing.
Wow,you have a 34DD....Ur future BF/husband is a very lucky man
work on your pectoral muscle. i am a 32DDD age 25 female and from doing stuff at the gym it worked on my pectorals and made the mstronger
You don't need to do anything. Hand sanitizer quickly evaporates. A few hours later, none of it is left. It sounds like you have some anxiety around the sexual activity, or possibly OCD. If you generally worry about contamination with dirt, then you should talk to your doctor about seeing a therapist to learn to deal with your OCD. If you're anxious about the sexual activity, a therapist will also help, or you can try to think through it yourself. If you're anxious about what you're doing, you don't have to keep doing it.
Have a shower and wash yourself, if it stings. Otherwise, there's nothing to worry about.
Thank him for looking out for your health. .
Well hey at least you are nice and clean?
Wash your vagina out..? With water?
nothing and you'll be fine
nothing. u will be all right.
Well, in most cases, the mother is a terrfied child herself. Most of these cases involve teenagers. Usually young teenagers who feel (sometimes rightfully so) that they don't have support. They fear how thier parents may react. That thier parents may become violent or force them to move out. They may fear the reaction of thier peers. My big point is that they're usually teenagers with no support. It doesn't excuse the action. But if our society wasn't so focused on shaming teenagers for sex, then it wouldn't happen nearly as frequently.
Indeed. Back in the day it was happening so often that we changed the laws to make it easier for women to just let the state adopt the baby. All they had to do was drop it off at a police or fire station. How difficult is that?
The important thing is that she didn't have an abortion. Dumping the baby in a trash bin is not a problem. Just make sure you don't have an abortion.
I read about a teenage couple who put their baby in a dumpster, but I don't think this happens very often. Most women have their baby in a hospital and take it home with them.
I have something to say. Oh you bet I do. Any living being of human parents that has a beating heart as does its human parents is a human-beiing. When it is no longer a zygote has blood traveling through its veins, a central nervous system and is of human parentage it is human. fetus has all of those requirements an embro has some and a lump of cells does not.
I am a woman, and I have missing teeth. They do not bug me at all, because I don't worry about things like how my smile looks. If you are worried about the way your smile works there are fake teeth, implants, etc that you can get to make your smile look perfect again.
Get fake teeth.
Question somewhere?
what about them?
I m 15 and I m at a point in my life where I m starting to think that life is meaningless and we just try to give it meaning but it doesn t really matter. I ve been debating whether or not to smoke because I really don t care about dying earlier. I don t care about getting cancer. I have an anxiety disorder and I feel like it would help. The only thing I m worried about is the smell. I ******* hate the smell of cigarettes. Is this normal to think?
Nicotine is a bad idea. At first it will reduce your anxiety, but then your anxiety will come back even worse. You'll keep smoking more and more so that you get only the reduction in anxiety, not the increase in anxiety that comes afterward. See your doctor for help. There are prescription medications that will work much better than nicotine for your anxiety.
Smoking only helps with the stress and anxiety it causes in the first place. I'm a casual smoker now - it's a bad decision, but I can't help it. Do something with your life, like right NOW!!! That'll help more than anything, help people, try to get your dream job, maybe find your dream job.
You should not beat around the bush without targeting your main issue. Take some or the other drastic steps in RIGHT DIRECTION immediately without fail. Honestly speaking and to be frank with you it is not a genuine doubt. You are trying for a solution, which will lead you to more horrible situations. Why don't you consult a professionally qualified doctor and seek clarifications for all your "genuine" doubts.
No, don't smoke it'll stain your teeth and the smell will really stink. Try to use medication for your anxiety.
YEs, and the total lack of fiber. Drink half a cup of water per hour awake. Avoid red meat, fast food, high fat food, cheese. Eat more fruit, veggies, and whole grains. So 1/2 of your diet should be fruit and veggies and another 1/4 should be whole grains. No sugar, no white flour.
Eat healthier :)
mcdonalds is bad .. not happy meal for u
if your fat, then u sit too much then ur *** hurts
The only time I touched shít was when I went to pick lint up off the floor and it was a tiny nugget of my cat's ásshole's finest. I washed my hands with rubbing alcohol three times, then showered in bleach. I smelled like burnt flesh for a week.
Why do you touch it? Just stop touching it, it's gross.
No you're Gonna die, nice knowing ya.
Lmao. You'll be fine.
nope, you are going to die Poop Master

I have anxiety and depression , had therapy then my doctor gave me anti depressants. I have self medicating a higher dose than my doctor gave me. I have been on them for 3'years , I've Been taking an extra 10mg than my prescribed dose to really take away the low moods. I am fed up of taking them, I want to come off. When I stop I get really ill like the flu. Any advice? 23 year old girl.
You are very sick. Go to your medical doctor first. Then listen and do what your medical doctor said.He may send you to another doctor and you must to that to get well. Good luck.
It might be scary to talk to your doctors but I really recommend it. You don't know the effects it may have on you body.
The anxiety will mean all decisions are fear based not good find a therapist you want to see .
"Is my body healthy for my age?" Your weight is almost within the healthy range, it's a little high, but better a few pounds over than under. Being underweight can actually cause stress on the body. The farther underweight someone is the greater the level of stress is on the body,, especially the internal organs. However also being more than about seven, to ten pounds overweight, also can also create stress on the body.
your body sounds fine to me
You're fine
Your are fine the way you are.
I'm sorry to seem impersonal, I'm a bit tired. I've often related what I've learned about depression, self harm, etc in other answers, including links to relevant research & sometimes pictures of diagrams I made to help explain topics easier.
Ever heard the expression, "There's a million fish in the sea?" Time will heal your pain and you'll find someone else. Be strong.
You are a deranged stalker, but don't kill yourself. Just have yourself arrested, and spend you life in jail.
"I want to die but die the worst way i can get. I deserve it." 100% true. You do deserve it. Make sure it's painful. We hate you.

Grow up and stop posting phony garbage stories on here.
Nicely push her off.
You should have told the teachers or whoever was there watching out for the kids.
Fûck her right in the pûssy!
Omg, i laughed out loud at this!! Um, I'd have to say no... Creative, yes, but probably not the best way. Plus how is she supposed to know that it means you're breaking up with her??
I think so. I mean, if you think things are on the verge and you don't like being the dumper, take a physical dump!
Aw hell yeah! That's genius!
You cannot get pregnant from touching sperm in a bathtub if that is what you are asking. Yes, it would be dead.

im a male in my late 30s, i have suffered an unfortunate hard life, being victimised and bullied a lot.....i suffer with borderline personality disorder....i live alone in a council flat with no support network except my mum. - my mum lives miles away from me in a bungalow. ive never had a stable long term relationship with a girl i am sad to say....never in my life, because i missed out on socializing and mixing? i live a very lonely life.....and i wonder will i ever find a girl? - even though i have low self esteem and are overweight.
No. It is not too late to find a girl Try out new hobbies try and make an effort to meet people
No of couse not, garentee a women out there is in a similar situation to yours. First things first you need to get on a healthy path. Eat right exercise daily. Start small and gradually increase.
Weight has nothing to do with it. Most likely the personality disorder. Depends on how you treated the past women. You continue down that path you will be alone.
it's never too late
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme has been the better of the enhancers I have tried. Starts of slow, and build up. By the end of the 4th day I was waking up in the middle of the night with huge wood. I have had a good experience so far, and as far as i can tell this is among the top 3 I have tried.
Totally normal. Any sight of a sexual act of a female will always turn a guy on, no matter who is doing it. Don't worry mate.
If it were me, I'd put it out of my head and pretend it never happened. One way males get turned is visually, so you probably got aroused simply from seeing a sexual act, but once it registered in your brain that it was your Ma... you became repulsed. Totally normal.
ask if she needs help or wants to get la id
Surprisingly, to gain weight it's not to eat more fat or sugar, studies show that walking slowly whilst drinking water increase body mass by 10%. But it should be done occasionally, like, every three days. Hope this helps
eat tons and tons of chicken and do intense workouts (you can do body weight exercises) that leave you exhausted. This is how celebrities get bulk real quick for movies they have been selected for. Just always eat, there should never be a span of more than 2 hours where you don't eat something.
Protein shakes
Eat food high in saturated fat. Refer to Dr Nick from The Simpsons - he can give you advice.
Increase your portion size gradually and include calorie-dense foods like nuts, butter, peanutbutter and cheese.
prayer, pray, and more praying fix and cure the problem for good. Give it a go, build a relationship with Jesus Christ as you would a close friend. Read the living word of God, the bible (English standard version is great) and seek Him with your whole heart, watch what happends, its AMAAAZZING!
Meditation has been found in many studies to alleviate anxiety - however, the results are not instant.
there are tons, just do a search for natural remedy for anxiety on your search engine
meditation, deep breathing exercises, Lemon Balm helps and if you are willing some people feel marijuana helps with anxiety
Kalms are worth a try. you might not be able to get them where you are, but you should be able to find something with the similar ingredients. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kalms-Tablets-8...
I would advise to start training "all natural" and add supplements progressively. When you begin weight lifting (which you should not have begun before 16, *that* would be bad, so I suppose you're a beginner), you have to first learn how to train, how to eat and so on. Supplements come as a second step, so that you can really take the time to understand how this or that works for you. That being said, I've never heard about any negative effect of creatine except the hydration issues. Just avoid taking it for too long if you don't want to affect the endogenous production.
I do and I'm 16
Yeah, but if you can't even spell it right then I doubt you bothered to read up on it. And not reading up on it can be harmful because that stuff is potent. Long story short, if you are going to take creatine*, make sure that you drink a lot of water.
yes
slim
Slim I believe. Cause things outdoors are dirty but not that dirty.
you won't get anything
A year and a half ago I noticed a painless knot in my breast but wrote it off as a cyst and never went to the doctor. Now, the knot doesn't feel much larger width wise, but feels like it may be deeper (hard to explain) and now there is continuous pain with it. I do have an ultrasound scheduled (too young for a mammogram--26), but I'm wondering if an ultrasound is even necessary? Cancer is painless, from what I've read. This is most likely a cyst or something harmless. Wouldn't you think?
Yeah, it does sound like a cyst. I am sure your ultrasound will put your mind at ease. Highly unlikely to be anything else. Yes. it is very necessary and will tell you just exactly what it is.
It is great that you are getting an ultrasound done. Yes, you are correct, this is probably a harmless cyst or fibroadenoma but it is good to confirm that and gave a basis for comparison in the future.
Wearing a bra (or crop top) or not wearing a bra has no influence on breast cancer risk. It is a popular myth. Personally, I have no idea why anyone would choose to wear one to bed. I was required to wear one 24/7 during my healing from surgery for breast cancer and HATED it. My bra always comes off when I can.
No it doesnt and personally I dont like wearing a bra to bed as I prefer to let them hang free - usually under my armpits, lol
How on earth would wearing a bra to bed cause cancer??!?!?!!!
cancer is not caused by anything you wear to bed.
I don't know how old you are, where you heard this, why you believe it. I'd ask your OB/GYN when you have your next appointment. But that is NOT true.
Of course not. Don't believe everything you hear.
Odd...Why have pizza if you don't like it ?.. Maybe have a nice sandwich instead or better yet, a hamburger .🍔
Congrats your a normal human
Well, don't hate them. Eat them.

Unfortunately I can't. There are not many Indians in Spain, and not many Spaniards around the world where Indians live, so I don't know any famous or non-famous examples of someone of this mix. If it was half British and half Indian, sure ;)

You're so ugly, you scared the crap out of the toilet.
I have been eating soup from a can for nearly 60 years and it has done me no harm although I dont often eat the ones that come in a carton
There is no difference. Canned (or boxed) food is highly processed, and this is what can lead to cancer, but the risk is minimal if it is part of an overall healthy diet.
Soup doesn't come in cardboard..
Keep your immune system strong by using CBD oils and vitamins C and D3 and no one will get cancer!!!
Nothing. The warm water from the shower will unstuff your nose and you will get clean hair in the process.
You will then have clean hair; and still have a cold.
You will probably die a long and painful death
nothing will happen to you
It would get wet.
Drink a lot of water. That can help flush out whatever is there. Cranberry juice is good for preventing a UTI, not so much for treating one. Take Vitamin C. Avoid chocolate because it can cause inflammation in general. Taking a bath with some baking soda is supposed to help for women. If those don't work, then see a doctor and get some antibiotics.
If drinking a few extra glasses of water (nothing crazy) doesn't help you need a doctor - - and proper medicine. A UTI can spread the kidneys and become very serious, very quickly.
The telephone. Use it to make an appointment to see a Dr. Attempting to treat infection with foods, juices or anecdotal stories can result in the infection remaining untreated possibly worsening to sepsis, kidney failure, liver failure.
Cranberry juice. Make sure you get pure cranberry juice, not cranberry cocktail. It works.
I just started a new job in a new city and everyone in my company is super fit. I am significantly overweight, not like TLC fat but Kevin James fat. I have started exercising and eating better, but it doesn't happen over night. I know regardless a healthy weight and good eating habits are better for me overall. Does being overweight make people devalue my input on work projects?
No being a dumb ignorant person is nothing with body size is unprofessional
No. Start living a heathy lifestyle. It's never too late to make a change
No, not if you project authority and produce beyond company standards. It helps to try to advance via more education.
No. The only cars able to take the doughnut fuelled weight of 2 cops!

Every once in a while when I m just walking outside or whatever, I feel like I m not living. It s hard to explain, but my perspective is screwed up. I finally got back my emotions but I m just really tired of hearing voices and my mind playing tricks on me, nightmares and feeling paranoid all night long. I ve tried to pinch myself in public but it doesn t work anymore. Will I ever get my life back? Please help.
It is not something to "get rid of." However, you can learn to deal with it. I'm so sorry about what you're going through. Are you currently seeing a therapist or psychiatrist? It sounds as if you are struggling right now, and I hope everything gets better. Take care xx.
I take it you diagnosed yourself..... In which case congratulations! As soon as you go to college you will forget all about it. REAL Schizophrenia can not be gotten rid of. It requires lifelong medication to control it.
schizophrenia isn't something that can't be 'gotten rid of' but it can be dealt with. if you have been officially diagnosed, ask your gp about medication and or therapy. if you haven't, talk to your gp anyway. they should give you impartial advice that is best for you. until then, try your hardest to keep yourself safe and research coping mechanisms other people like you use.
Ive delt with similar things when i was 15-17 i have returned to normal since, just give it time and these things will Flee. Pray also Jesus Can Help.

If you stop smoking now, you will lower your risk of getting lung cancer from smoking cigarettes, but you wouldn't necessarily lower your chances of getting some other type of cancer from some other reason. At your age, it might take you 40 years to develop lung cancer from smoking cigarettes. On the other hand, you might smoke every day for the rest of your life and never develop lung cancer. Who knows? Doctor's can only predict what might happen; they make no guarantees about anything.
Sometimes 40 years other times 5 years an once in awhile never .But you are 9 times more likely to get lung cancer if you smoke.
Yes, if you stop no it is almost assured that you will not develop lung cancer/disease. This puffing method you are using will not help either as it could put you at risk for mouth or tongue cancers or infections(look up some pics)
30+ years
just stop it now before its too late.
It's great that you are reaching out for help! We are so sorry to hear that you are feeling so much emotional pain that you are cutting. It really does sound like you have been going through a lot. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent, aunt, uncle, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. We would suggest getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
Its a symptom of depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
I don't know your situation, but I would seek emotional support from someone if you are cutting yourself. I used to be seriously depressed (never get to the point to cutting), but I never told anyone that I was scared that would leave me. Instead I got warmth from my best friend and lover. If you have a best friend whom you trust then I would talk to them. You could also seek comfort online, there are many websites that do these sort of things and keep your identity anonymous.
Go online and find the phone numbers of cutting/self-harm hotlines and call them right away. They are free and confidential, so they are safe to talk to. And they are specially trained to help people in your exact situation. Maybe they can help you figure out a good way to tell your father.
i would just let your dad get angry if you need to ask him to get you help, you need to stop cutting, you can end up cutting an artery by mistake, plus cutting is real painful, not sure why you would want to do it, i hate pain
Find an adult you can trust! GET HELP.
It doesn't sound like he was being rude. You brought up the issue of weight loss, and he was giving you advice. He wasn't asking you to lose weight and he didn't call you fat or anything.
I think he was just trying to make sure you're healthy, if he straight up calls you fat and is forcing you to loose weight then i think that would be considered rude
Hi as he was following up in your conversational gambit. You stated a desire to "trim down". He merely followed up with helpful suggestions. In addition, after the fact, there's not much to do re a casual comment.
No, he was not being rude. He was giving you constructive advice to help you.
maybe he is right tho. 2 minutes seems pretty pathetic for a workout
I had a 5+ cm tumor with no lymph nodes involved. I still have no lymph nodes involved, but the cancer has spread throughout my body via the blood stream. What the general public does not understand is that breast cancer can spread via two ways ... lymph system and blood ... so the lymph node test is not the only measure of whether or not chemo is needed. Trust your medical team. Ask THEM lots of questions. Get second and third opinions if you want/need to, but don't let what you see in Hollywood movies influence your decisions.
I only had one lymph node out of 13 affected and my tumour was 5cm. They may not decide on the chemo so just go along and see what the oncologist says. I had the lot and am still here 6 years later so best of luck.
I agree with Tavy - there may be signs of it spreading even if it's not in the Lymph nodes. That said, I'm a fan of getting second opinions for things like this, esp. if you have questions that aren't getting answered.
Looks like you need another opinion. I had an elaborate procedure to identify one lymph node and that was checked. Did anyone mention what sort of cancer it was or what stage?
Considering that you immune system fights infections and both chemo & radiation can destroy your immune system, ask the doctor for an alternative therapy.
There is no guarantee that there are no minute cancer cells. Radiation and Chemo will kill them off.
Its probably a precum bro. Fap a little more and you will surely ejaculate, that is surely a semen...
No , colour is normally pink
something is wrong with you.
Depression is common but easy to treat. Ask a dr. if you could have low dose Zoloft. After your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel so much better.--- Then find big happy churches, attend age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Its also the best way to meet good people. And talk with the pastor/minister; where else can you get counseling for free? -- Remember God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
Don't take antidepressants. They're evil. They fukced me up. Just smoke weed or if you're too depressed for that then get drunk. Then the next day get high. Drinking is one and done when depressed. Then it's only weed, because weed don't make you more depressed
Take some drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. You should compulsorily deal with such important issues firmly, efficiently and effectively. Use your discrimination powers wisely. Also please consult a psychiatrist forthwith and take further necessary as per psychiatrist's instructions.
Umm...no...that's not normal at all. I used to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and I have really bad anxiety because of it, and as a person whose had/has mental disorders, I'm offended. People who have mental disorders want to be normal so badly, and here you are WISHING you had a mental disorder. Shame on you. I can't believe that you want a mental disorder. There are people with mental disorders that end up being driven to a mental hospital. Is that really what you want? I'm sure you don't, so what I advise is that you reread your question with logic and realize how ridiculous you sound. Smh...
Um, no, that's not normal. But you should be happy, because you yourself probably already have a personality disorder (which, yes, is a mental disorder). It sounds a lot like narcissism. Don't fake it either, a mental illness isn't something you can fake and get away with.
Fail to see what you image to be pleasant about having a mental disorder. Do you think of it as some sort of escape from the normal pressures of life, an escape from all responsibility, an excuse just to be able to act like a fool . Suggest that if that is your ultimate aim in life, then you obviously already have your mental disorder now.
Your therapist is wrong; the time to forgive yourself is right now. You were young and stupid and I agree that your bf does not need to know all those details.------- Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Keep the past where it belongs.......... BEHIND YOU No need to relive that moment, because it's not you anymore. You have grown and learned. It won't hurt anything if he doesn't know. You need to forget as well. Keep busy and think how blessed you are. Loving family, boyfriend, honest with yourself. You have a lot going for you, so how, no why hate yourself?
I'm sorry but one does not "develop OCD" And if you really do have PTSD, it's because you experienced an event far, far, far, _F_A_R_ more traumatic than not telling your teenage boyfriend you once gave another boy a handjob. Get over yourself. And find a new therapist. Yours is just telling you junk so s/he continue sucking off your parents' health insurance.
well you weren't with him back than and only tell him if you want too
No. Everyone does stuff they regret. No point spreading the misery.
there's no need to divulge any past lovers. confessing will not improve your relationship. it's in the past. leave it there.
You would very likely get irritated and experience burning. You may even get an infection. Your fertility does not depend on your vagina. Everything that make babies are deep inside you. Your ovaries, Fallopian tubes and uterus. Alcohol in your vagina cannot reach these parts. So if she is infertile, she is infertile from something else. Not that. Or perhaps she is just making up stories.
If you did that you would only do it once. Your vagina would feel like it was on fire
That would probably hurt really bad.
If you put it in your vagina, idk. If you put it up your butt, you could get drunk... or die. Because there's no way for your body to filter the alcohol.
That's not the way! Eating only fruits will lead to calorie deficit and you may gain weight in the long term! Eat nutritious foods, lean meat, straight proteins and stuff like that. Healthy fats is the way to go. Cut all the possible carbs, fruits are great but only fruits? Not so great. And a 15 min run won't be as efficient. You need to work a minimum of 45 minutes to burn calories efficiently. Good luck! :)
Probably a couple of pounds.
It's never to late start and get a new hobby that will keep you away from porn get a favorite tv show or a job if you don't have one get something that will keep away from porn then you won't have as much time to watch porn
Probably not, you like what you like, so stop torturing yourself about it. Drug addicts will rob old ladies in the street, you're not doing that to buy porn, are you?
The first step is recognizing you have a problem. But seriously, how much is it interfering with your life? Are you able to have adult conversations with members of the opposite sex? Mature relationships? Everything is relative. Fantasy is fantasy, reality - reality. Myself, I have a "Criminal Minds" addiction. Can't stop watching that stuff. But I keep my day job. Like I say, it is all relative. :)
than stop watching it
Good Heaven's No.... I wish I was 22 again...sigh.
If 22 seems like a long time to you then yes.
Nah
When you sleep naked you get a deeper sleep as your body doesn't get twisted up in any clothing as you naturally move around in bed. Also your entire skin gets to totally relax and rejuvenate when it is not partially wrapped in clothing. There are no disadvantages to sleeping naked and a high proportion of both men and women do so every night.
I've been sleeping naked since last March. It was one the best discoveries of my life. I sleep naked whether or not my family is home. They don't mind I think. They just find it odd. Haha. The benefits are that it's more comfortable, my sex fantasies and erections are much more intense, and my balls are more free.
Aside from the obvious sexual arousal, etc. the main benefit is, it's natural; your body's largest organ can b-r-e-a-t-h-e properly instead of being restricted by synthetic clothing - I'm talking about skin, in case you're wondering. It allows it to maintain a more even temperature, regulate better, etc. There's really no reason why you can't do it when family is home. If you're in the States, it's coming into your Summer, so that's a great excuse to indulge.
Benefit? It makes me happy. All the men in my family sleep naked. My dad s grandfather told him that his dad did that, too, so it s about a hundred years of men sleeping naked. It's not "religion" and wasn't required, but was just normal when I was a little kid.
I sleep naked all year round. It's the only comfortable way to sleep, there's nothing to restrict the freedom of my genitals.
It is comfortable as nothing obstructing to have a sleep erection. It is also comfortable to masturbate nude in bed. Enjoy. Regards.
You get to sleep how you feel most comfortable?
Less restriction of the gonads.
Yes
yes, any time now. Read Matthew and Revelation. It's tricky so go to a bible study to learn how to interpret it. It says there will be a NEW heaven and a NEW earth because the former will be no more. WOW! I can hardly wait!
That's the story, he will claim his own, burn off the rest, then return everyone to live in harmony for 1000 years under his rule.
yes
It'll be the new yahoo owners that will do that
you should be around 110-115
That's probably about right or maybe 5 pounds light.
Very light. I'm the same height, hover around 130, and people still call me skinny.
Pneumonia is one of the leading causes of death in the world. In the USA, it and the flu are the 8th leading cause of death, where those two illnesses work together to take more lives than kidney disease or suicide.
Yes it is. And who ever said hospitals are sterile? Only the operating rooms are. The rest of them are breeding grounds. I 've been exposed to MRSA more times than I can imagine.
Absolutely.
Yes. Many die from it.
Yes it is. Go to the Dr. and get treatment. It is curable but deal with it right away.
Yes.
Of course.
no it's not if it's looked after
Thank you everyone
Certainly is.
Introduce her to cancer killers then!! PLANT ESSENTIAL OILS OR CBD OILS which are the best cancer killers in the universe!!! Avoid mainstream medical and their toxic partners big pharma like the plague that they actually are!!! CANCER IS A BIG BUSINESS TO THEM AND THEIR CURE ACTUALLLY KILLS MOST OF THEM!!! A ONE PERCENT CURE RATE IS NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT!!!
No. Your dream was related to the picture of the girl you saw. Means absolutely nothing. No there is no reason to tell your mother. You do nothing.
Means nothing
No, being someone who contribute to society is a great accomplishment. No matter how small that accomplishment is
No. Curing AIDS would be.
No
no
Yes it's dangerous. You can permanently damage the eye causing blindness. That's why it's banned in competitions. As for real-life self defense, yes it's very effective. "Go for the eyes" is a common tactic. You don't even have to strike the eye directly. Just scratching near the eye, or pushing your thumb into the eye even when closed, is very effective at disabling an attacker. This will give you time to get away.
Yes, the eyes are fragile and you can blind someone like that. Didn't you get yelled at a million times as a kid that you were going to "poke your eye out"?
There's a hole in your skull where you eyeballs are, so there is nothing solid between the eyeball socket & your brain.
too bad letterman retired, he could have added this to the stupid pet tricks gag, stupid human tricks.....he'd have a double billing extravaganza of stupidity !!!!!
yes, blunt trauma can cause cataract. source : 'blunt trauma' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataract
Yeah..
Yea man.
why don't you jab a screwdriver into your eye as hard as you can, and then get back to us,............ you dumb @$$
Yes,it can blind,and kill.
You're not fat at all, in fact your height and weight are the same as mine and I am tiny to the point where people comment on it and ask me how I manage to stay so slender so I can assure you that you are in no way even close to being fat.
Absolutely not! That's a good weight for your age.
How fat one is depends SOLELY on the ratio of fat mass to their entire mass.
No you're not fat.
KYS SWINE
No. I haven't in like 20 years.
That's good. Vomiting is to remove something from your gut. No vomiting means nothing to remove. You're healthy.
I havent vomitted since I was pregnant 37 years ago
Noyes your a freak of nature
No.
Well, wait on you period. If it doesn't ever show up, I would definitely take a pregnancy test. There is no way to know for sure that you are not pregnant unless you take that test or if your period shows up. You can use emergency Plan B -- that can be used up to 5 days after intercourse. Here is a link for more information: https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/morning-after-pill-emergency-contraception For future sex encounters, please use precautions. Use some type of birth control or use condoms. Visit www.plannedparenthood.org for more information on how to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancies and STDs. Good luck and I hope you find the links provided helpful for assisting you in making good, healthy decisions.
I have never known of a woman to be fertile a day before her period.
Dang that's a quickie.. 2 mins only? wow poor girl
The sex only lasted up to two minutes -the person asking the question
I expect 7 inches would satisfy most men, but it depends on how big is anus is. You'd need to check the laws on consent where you live however, since having sex with 14 year old boys is illegal in most places.
Yes
Yes!
Yes it's big
sorry but your 3 inches below the minium, 10 inches is the minimum for must girls.
that's the fake internet average
oh yes yes very big big !!
so what if we were to say no its small... what would you do?
It makes masturbation less pleasurable, so it is an old custom instigated by religious men. It removes nerve endings so the male has less feeling. There is no practical purpose in this. Washing it daily keeps it perfectly clean, which is all that is necessary. From a religious standpoint, if God made us the way He wants, why does man think he can cut a bit off and make it better?
Prevent infections that become more serious as you age. My father finally had to be circumcised at 73. It was an in hospital procedure and he was in for 3 days. Catheter and everything. No man wants that.
It provides the man with a much larger orgasm than those who aren't circumcised.
It's cleaner. And studies show that women who are married to uncircumcised men have a higher rate of cervical cancer.
Years ago crazy barbers took the saying "take a little off the top" to the extreme
There isn't one. It's disgusting how genital mutilation of boys is encouraged.
It makes my dick look good.
Without more information, and a patient history, it is impossible to make a differential diagnosis. If the pain is, as you relate, excruciating, you probably should seek medical attention. It could be something you ate, or it could be gas. You might try lying on your left side for a while, and see if that helps. But if the pain persists, talk to the doc. Feel better! :)
Seek medical attention immediately. It's true that it could be just gas pains, like one person said, but it could be more serious than that. I find it's always better to be safe than sorry. You could have appendicitis, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, or a number of other things. And if it turns out to be just gas, think of the relief you'll have knowing it's not something more serious!
See a doctor
Lying down (front facing up) and taking deep breaths.
Go to the doctor or the emergency room.
Could be acute pancreatitis, which may lead to death.
Go to the doctor.
advil all the way
Another ignorant troll with too much time on their hands. How sad. An 11 year old isn't permitted to be on here anyhow... so that automatically says BS right there.
You're not fooling anyone on here. The average erect penis size for an 11 year old is around two inches.
You are young. Penis grows upto the age of 21. Dw you will have pretty good length around 2 feet by the age 21.
it's normal and it sounds to me like they lie
Punch yourself in the groin.
False
I'd be worried that the father is a pedophile.
You! Out of the gene pool!!!
Stop.
You are one sick puppy.
true....?
This is possibly not what you're after, but I'll briefly relate the tale just in case. A man fell down stairs and his sight was permanently lost. Twenty years later he experienced a similar accident and could suddenly see again. It seems his optic nerve was simply knocked out of place and the second accident righted the problem. He was very lucky to regain his vision after so many years, but unfortunate to have the accident occur in the first place. Besides that people's vision improves upon corrective eye surgery, but I assume you mean improves without medical intervention. To my knowledge that doesn't happen.
Children up to the age of 12-13 can outgrow hyperopia and not need glasses any more. That doesn't happen with myopia though.
No, I've actually never had vision problems before.
mine did when I had cataracts removed.
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Changing out your bed sheets is a good hygienic practice, but, I'm sorry to say does very little for your acne. Acne is a hereditary condition not a hygienic one. The only product that will clear your skin of acne is a new lotion that came out called bevoline by skin divine. Good Luck:)
Acne can have soooo many different causes. I offer you one: food allergies. I used to suffer from painful acne until i figured out i was allergic to soy. It's just a thought.
If you decide to try the product of Ultra Organic argan life Treatment,you have to be careful the product whis is %100 pure one. My scars completely clear up in about 5 weeks!
Find someone and love them until they love you just as much if not more than the person gone. "If you can't be with the one you love, then learn to love the one you're with". Once you have the pleasures\benefits of love again, the pain of love will lessen and you can get on with your life.
Don't end it all! There are still people who care about you. They will be devastated if you end your life.
You can try making new friends
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online. i know the feeling.
looks dont matter. you should know this by now. and dont stress it. If he ends up rejecting you so what ? 1, its not the end of the world. 2, he's not the one. think about it
The first line of defense against depression and anxiety is B vitamins. Get nutritional yeast powder and/or B-100 pills. Vitamin B2 is a water soluble dye that turns urine bright yellow. When the color fades, it's time for another pill. Read some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right. Take acting classes to learn basic social skills.
Masturbation has got nothing to do with your weight. Masturbation healthy, but if not done as an addiction. First- Search for a healthy diet which is a mix of carbs and fats in the right amount. Second - Start exercising! Join the gym or if not start doing push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups at home. It is good enough. Third- Find a hobby, find some passion & direct your thoughts there whenever you keep feeling unnecessarily *****. Fourth- Keep masturbating, once a day is fine, even twice a day sometimes. But don't make it your addiction. And don't worry more often then not once you start growing up and get to your late teens-early twenties you will put on weight. Cheers!
Masturbation is scientifically shown to reduce androgen receptors, this could cause an imbalance of utilized testosterone (it does not lower testosterone but it reduces how much testosterone is effectively used) It can take up to 15 days of no masturbation to begin recovering from the reduced androgen receptors. These hormonal balances/imbalances can affect weight as well as muscular development and whether you develop a masculine or feminine figure. My advice is don't overly masturbate, if you masturbate a couple times a week you'll feel more energetic and positive than if you masturbate once a day or more.
Being underweight has no connection on masturbating daily. its just that your metabolic rate is working fast than you consume calories. there are overweight people who masturbates a lot within a day but still remain's on their weight. its just all about physical stats.
if you are underweight u need to find out why / is there some thing to be done.eating right foods.Your digeston is weak and u need to improve it now playing every day does not help at all as u r already so thin and this is taking away so much energy from you. I can not make you fat but can help to make u liver better and better health.So write to me with full details what u eat every day I will help u to send a diet plan which u follow u will feel bette health all round my email is br75@mail.com
I am 15 and I weigh 200 pounds. You are under weight wow. Go eat some McDonald's hamburgers.
I seriously doubt you will do any damage. Everyone else (or the vast majority of the human population) masturbated at least once a day when they were 15 and we (or most of us) grew up to be happily married individuals with normal, healthy sex lives.
No, masturbation has no impact on your weight. All the overweight guys masturbate just as much as you do. Just start working out, running or walking to build up muscle and you'll start to fill out. Certainly don't eat to gain weight- when low body fat exists, perfect time to pack on muscle, not fat.
So you are 14 and no, your weight has no connection with masturbation. Your body will not let you damage it with sex. And 14 year old boys are pretty randy. Daily is small beer. You must be healthy. < M
Lol... no you aren't doing any harm. All boys masterbate at least once or twice a day. The fat ones and the skinny ones. It has no effect on your weight or anything else.
bragg apple cider vinegar, full strength right on the wart, allow to dry repeat as often as you like prior to bed, repeat each night til they dry up and disappear....
Genital warts are transferable so to get rid of them you need to give them to someone else by telling them you don't have an std and then have sex with them. Your welcome!
If I had them (which I totally don't) I would (not did) get surgery to remove 3 ribs so I could suck myself off.
Yes you do coz you're a whôre
See a doctor. Not that you need to; )
you would see a doctor
Ignore the ignorant comments about your hymen. It will make sex easier because you will be self-assured and confident, but it won't change you physically.
It will all depend of the size of a dildo. I would be very surprised if a virgin could handle a large dildo starting off. You will probably tear your hymen which could make having sex the first few times less painful, the pain can be very intense if the male doesn't know what he is doing. I'd say a slim 6 inch vibrator would be the best thing to start off with.
if you are a virgin you should not be using a dildo. You probably will not orgasm, and it may hurt when you try to put it in. The best thing is to gently rub your clitoris till you orgasm
Yes it will break your hymen meaning when you do have real sex it will be easier for the guy to penetrate you.
Im 14 years old boy and whenever i stand up from very long time laying in bed i feel really dizzy, my vision is so blurry, and my surroundings are revolving. And i almost die today because i smack my own head against the wall and almost fell into the floor of my bathroom but luckily i managed to hold the door knob tightly enough to save my life. Is this normal? Should i consult a doctor? Do i have a disease? And im not obese people, im 45 kg or about 99 pounds in case weight has something to do with this, THANKS!
Nothing to worry about. When you get up, sit at the edge of the bed for at least 5 minutes before standing. No you won't die. What happens when you stand up from a lying position is that your blood pressure suddenly drops. Yes you can speak to your doctor, but try that, first.
I had the same problem. Just do aerobic exercise to improve your cardiovascular system (and strengthen your heart). Drink protein shakes to recover faster. Also (covering my *** here), you should consult a doctor.
low blood pressure, malnutrition symptoms eat eggs, beef, lots of vegetables and fresh fruits
Hi the average male penis is 5 inches and 1 inch diameter end of story.
I already used two and a half bottles and the product is meeting up to my expectations. My small friend became my big friend after this Prolargentsize herbal capsule. My wife noticed the difference in my penis, I didn’t say anything about my secret. I enjoy the result with my wife. I have just ordered the third bottle from Prolargentsize website.
Your penis at 7 inches is definitely a very good size.
Any answers saying sounds tiny etc I I will report you and get you banned
Sounds tiny.
average if you are afro american
Sadly yes, a lot of people, even women, still believe that the hymen has to break. Some even still believe that a woman's first time is painful and bleeding is normal. I even knew a guy who believed that women can't have orgasms.
Unlike the concept of virginity, the hymen is real and can be broken during intercourse and is probably the most common way it happens, though you can break it other ways. I think you are referring to the hymen being broken meaning you are no longer a virgin and that is a ridiculous notion and opens up a whole can of worms. EDIT: So if a hymen never breaks and only stretches, how can a penis access the vagina and deposit sperm on the cervix? Wouldn't it still be covered by the hymen?
It's fairly normal to tear the hymen if the guy gets inside you more than 3 inches or so. If he doesn't tear it, and just got to it and you had to stop, you still lose virginity just because he got inside you.
To everyone saying that u are a perfect weight..U ARE NOT! U are underweight in fact...by a lot of pounds. The average weight for a 15 year old girl is 115-130. DO NOT starve yourself, it will mess up your body. Eat good carbs aka avocados, cheese, ect. Keep your body healthy and good luck!!
Are you kidding? You're extremely underweight. A 15 year old should be 120
trust me you are not fat. that's like the ideal weight for a 15 year old
Dont starve yourself D:< You seem pretty healthy weight to me. Ignore them i betcha you're pretty and they're jealous that's the only reason why they'd displace (make fun) of you. Go for it! see if any wind blows if you start cheerleading. If you dont start now you might regret it later.
it depends how tall you are to tell if you're overweight. however starving yourself is never a good option since it can damage your body. if you really feel that you need to loose weight, you should talk to a parent / guardian or your doctor.
I don't think anorexia and cheer leading are a good concept for success
dont starve yourself d:&lt; you seem pretty healthy weight to me... ignore them i betcha you're pretty and they're jealous that's the only reason why they'd displace (make fun) of you... go for it! see if any wind blows if you start cheerleading... if you dont start now you might regret it later...
Hey. Don't starve yourself. And also, tell your parents. These people who say you're too fat are lying. 92 pounds is very light. Tell your parents to talk to the school. But please, don't starve yourself. That hurts you more than it helps.
If your foreskin is too tight (called phimosis) then it is possible to rip it during intercourse or, occasionally, masturbation. If you ripped your foreskin it will have bled profusely and needed medical attention. You can, however, avoid all possibility of ripping your foreskin during sexual activity by getting a circumcision. This will also bring you a lifetime of proven health and sexual benefits with no drawbacks.
You cannot rip your foreskin. It s very elastic.
How the hell would we know? Only you can know if you rip your foreskin dumbass.
I would like to know who told you that four and a half inches is average. Because that is incorrect. Since boys reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16... You should be at the adult average now of around 6 inches.
dude people lie - learn that and get used to it and you are on the small side of average so it is possible for some younger guys to be bigger
That's tiny meat for sure.
You're still Arab and you should be proud of that. But leaving Islam is a bigger concern. If you believe in God, don't you think he told you what he wants from you? War and terrorism is not one of them, so no need to associate it with Islam when Islam in fact wants the totally opposite.
Islam is a religion. Arab is a language and a culture.
Arabs are filthy animals. that dont have a heart towards people. arab girls should be killed without having pity on em arab guys should be killed too for their low IQ level I respect prophet sallah alayh w sallam just because he's the messenger, and not because of he;s an arab. being an arab is totally bullshit. bloody arabs should be destroyed completely
Don't be a drama queen. You're poorly educated and taking it out on others.
It sounds like something has opened your mind up to think more critically of your past religious connections?
Escape go Europe, dye your hail yellow and wear blue lenses and now you're European!
Salam You have a free choice as given by Allah with its consequences
You may have left but you will always remain a dirty filthy arab scum.
yes they do! gentle most of the time, women also like to be woken up.. if you get what I mean ;)
depends on the woman,some of them may not feel comfortable being touched by other people and prefer to keep in their own personal space. some women don't mind it at all. It depends on how you are touched, like if your mom or dad hug you and give you a kiss good bye that is different but if your are dating someone for the first time, I would not recommend touching them sexually or touching their hand or anywhere on their body because you are just getting to know the person and you don't know each other well.
Most women loved to be touched it just depends where you are and who you are and where.
Some do, some don't and there are places you should never touch a woman until you get close with her.
Depends on the women tbh...I personally don't like being touched or hugged by people, but that doesn't mean I don't love them, it just means I don't like being touched.
Yes, but it all depends by who, when and where. You're obviously not going to touch someone you just met (especially in a sexual way).
1 Depends on who they are and characteristics 2. I f.u.c.k.i.n.g don't like people touching me
depends on who's doing the touching, and how and where
Yes if we like the guy. We love affection for the most part. Physical and emotional.
Sometimes
Don't think about doing it. I broke my arm when I was 3 years old. I almost lost my arm back then.. I fell off a slide in the park, Heh, When the doctor puts the cast on your arm it's the most painful process of all.. I stayed with a cast for 6 months. Each month they put a new cast and my arm doesn't develop to it's original shape. They wanted to cut my arm open and do a manual surgery.. Glad I flew to a different hospital, telling me they did everything wrong with my arm, They got sued. My arm is still affected by what happened back then, it looks bent with I stretch it forward.
Yes
HELL YES!! I have broke my wrist three times, all in lower school, i was so young the first time ( year 2, 2nd grade) i cant remember that pain but then in year 4 (4th grade) i done it again and it hurt but i remember the last one so much! Year 6 (6th grade) the paon was horrible so yeah it hurts😂Xx
Yes you're breaking your wrist what would you expect?
My sister broke her wrist and she said it hurts. Alot after as well and you know it's broken because your wrist will go numnb
As a girl who broke her wrist trying to rollerskate, I can confirm it hurts like HELL.
Breaking anything hurts.
Breaking any bone hurts I would imagine
Obviously, breaking or cutting any part of the body hurts.
I don't think approval is the correct term. How can you approve something that isn't a choice?
Well its really not a relevant issue. Whether or not I approve of it it still exist.
No, I don't, but they have the right to choose that immoral lifestyle if they want to. God invented the penis so that it could be stuck inside of a vagina and secrete juice for reproductive purposes. The penis is not supposed to go inside of a butt hole. The butt hole was created so that we would have an exit for our food after we eat it. Putting a penis inside of a butt hole is not sanitary and it is immoral.
and do you approve red hayred, or green eyes people?
Doesn't need my approval. < M
I don't aprove, or disprove of it.
only if no females are availablr, prison, boys camp , the locker room,,,,,,,,,etc
Lots of different things can affect this. The liquid which comes from your penis when you ejaculate is mainly produced by your prostate, and by the seminal vesicle, which is a gland at the base of your penis. Your testicles just make sperm. If you've only recently started to ejaculate the amount will be very small, but will increase over time as your body matures. Within a year or two of starting to produce semen everything will be fully working. Once everything is fully working the amount will vary, depending on how sexually aroused you are and how long it's been since the last time you ejaculated. The prostate and seminal vesicle take time to 'recharge'.
The average amount of semen produced by men ranges between 1 to 10 ml (note: a teaspoon is 5 ml, and a tablespoon is 15 ml). If you're producing between this range, then you're average.
Almost all have the same amount of cvm like a tablespoon, more or less but itll depend on person, drink alot of water...
Drink some water beforehand but some guys just don't c um a lot. < M
depends on the amount of forplay there is... the more i tease it, the more comes out
Yep, it should be working erection-wise. If you have any pubic hair yet = you are in puberty. < M
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme is probably the most effective product I have used. For the time I took the product It made a difference in performance in the bedroom. First week i took half dose by opening the capsules, and after full dose and performance was good.
Yes it is. You will find that it happens more and more and that you will want to masturbate allot. This is all natural and normal. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
Perfectly natural, and in fact, common to all male children.
You didn't say how frequent that you masturbate. But yes ejaculating when you masturbate is normal. What would be the point otherwise?
Get a hobby like a sport or something.
No idea, how often do you do it? Average teen does it at least once a day.
Yes, you do.
i would cut back
Braxton sounds like a boy's name. Try a girls name.
No I don't like it and Braxton Hicks contractions come to mind.
Braxton even just Brax is a good name
It's alright. Lelisa's beautiful. I love Jonquil.
nope I don't like it at all and lots of people would probably make jokes about contractions
change it to trump
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I know what you are going through.... let me guess, furstrated, helpless, don't want to even go out in public and tried of people staring. I went through it for years. I tried almost every thing that came out. After summing it up ive could have bought a brand new honda... I was blessed with my new neighbor. She is a dermatologist, she turn me on to bevoline... Amazing results and not expensive at all. Make sure you get the one that comes in a gray and blue box made by skin divine... there are imitation out there. They are now also offering it on Amazon. I hope my answer helps. Good luck!
I received Arganrain argan oil fort he first time.. The Oil is creamy and absorbs into the skin and It does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without an oily feeling. I can honestly say I like this oil because it is natural, Argan oil, which is great for acne and It has the powerful anti aging quality. I liked it at all.

If you are hungry you should eat something. A pop tart should be safe.
No. Eat something light, like soup.
Have him visit his primary care doctor, or a clinic. Even a Pharmacist might help.
try Proactiv.com/deluxe

keep away from the sheep
What even!?
Only if the psychologist suggested that you don't attend school for a certain amount of days. If you are not going to school just because you don't feel safe or because you don't feel like it, it will not be excused. Even if you do manage to get a note, it will only account for maybe 2 days but not 16, and it will be excused not ignored.
Legally yes. But that doesn't mean that they won't make you jump through some hoops. Have you been in contact with your school and kept them updated? You'll need your psychologist to write an excuse detailing why you were out and which days you were out.
They don't remove them but with a note from your doctor they will be "excused absences". You should have someone bringing you the work you're missing.... you won't get to just skip the work... you'll have to make it up or retake the grade.....
The rules vary from school to school. Ask the school's administration about their rules and guidelines.

I tend to gain weight and heard about this product so I bought the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product . It’s only been a bit over a month now and not only I didn’t gain but I lost about 7 pounds. I also feel healthier a day that I’m taking this .
Yes, you'll lose weight. You'll also lose muscle. You need to eat protein. Where is your protein? This is a great way to lose weight and get very sick.
Losing gaining weight is not the names of what you eat, or the exercise you do, it's the amount of calories in the food you eat and the amount of calories burned in the exercise you do. So, nobody here can tell you based on the lack of specifics in the post. Note that roughly 3500 calories is said to equal one pound
It could be testicular cancer, which is the bad news, but the good news ( if you could call it that ) is that TC has a 96% survival rate, and if caught early you may not need too much treatment. You will know it has spread when you have lumps or pain in your lower back/abdomen, which means it's advanced. So, tell your parents and get to a doctor ASAP!!
I told my parents they said to watch it its not even on the testes its in the middle
You have to tell someone. This is the kind of thing that people can die over, so you HAVE to tell someone, preferably your parents.
Could be cancer go see a doctor quickly
mmm don't think you die :) but better to check it with a doctor, don't waste time...
You're not overweight at all, and shouldn't really be too concerned about your weight at the moment as you're still growing and developing. You're 13 years old, your last concern should be your weight and how your body looks, PLEASE do not let this become an obsession. Don't make a conscious effort to lose weight, just eat healthily and keep fit and active, and you will stay a good healthy weight as you get older, and you will feel confident in your body knowing that you're treating it well.
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product helped give me a flatter stomach. As we all know, lower belly fat is hard to get rid of. It also curbed my appetite without me feeling like I was missing out on something. Had more energy, without it affecting my ability to sleep. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't have any side effects.
You're crazy. ALMOST overweight means you're at normal weight.
Lol you're basing it off of a wii fit test. Don't believe that sh*t, however you are young and could start heading to the gym and get healthier. You're highschool self will most likely thank you
No you are not overwieght at all, not even close
Its spelled "penis"
Yes top 10% in length.
Kys
Its average, good size
no it's totally normal
First of all, a thirty-seven year old female is a woman, not a girl. Second, this sounds like the most dysfunctional relationship ever. If you have any intelligence, end it and don't look back.
if this was a movie, it'd have a 23% on rotten tomatoes and it would star that smarmy James Franco guy.
she didn't want to be found out and to scare you away she was mean and lied hoping you'd leave her be and move on. just move on she is a slut and don't deserve you.
Date me, i am 37 and my name is lynda too.
Who buys your packs? Because you're underage to buy them. Maybe you should avoid seeing that person who purchases the cigs for you. If there a family member than talk to them why you need to quit. Think about how your body will look like and feel in a couple years from now. It won't be healthy and you'll get stuck with long term or deadly health problems. Chewing gum helps. Try sugar free gum so you won't get cavities like i did lol
Valerian is one of the best thing for quit smoking or you can also can quit smoke by taking ginger juice.
If you smoke 1 a day, try smoking 80% of it a day. Then the following week 60%... and go lower and lower
Just stop buying them. You will find that the craving lessens quite quickly. After three weeks you have cracked it. Providing you don't buy any more.
try put pigs milk on the cigarate and wait for it to dry then smoke it and see dr max from africa
Just stop.
wow, use a shisha
o,g, good for you
UK answer. You are an adult in the eyes of the NHS from the age of 16. You are old enough to make your own medical decisions, give consent for medical treatment (including operations), and you have the right to confidentiality. The exception to this rule in the case of mental health is if you're hospitlaised, as you can't just disappear, or if you're deemed to be a suicide risk which is not the same as having suicidal thoughts. If a doctor must inform a parent that you are a suicide risk they will always discuss the matter with you first.
You doctor is not allowed to tell anyone what you tell or discuss with them no matter the situation of age
Ask him, if you mention anything about hurting yourself or others around you he/she is bound to tell someone (whether or not that would be your parents because of your age, I'm not sure) But I don't think he would tell them, it's nothing to be ashamed of though. It may be better if you do tell them.
No. The counselors will not tell anyone anything, UNLESS they suspect that you will seriously harm/kill someone or yourself. However, besides that exception, everything else is confidential.
I don't think he will tell them unless he is concerned about your safety.
No in the UK, your medical conditions are private.
If you're already lean - the weight is going to come off pretty slow and to be honest, your weight can fluctuate up to 5 pounds a day anyway. If you continue to lift while in a calorie deficit and get adequate protein .8 per pound of body weight, you should be able to retain most of your muscle. It's generally how it's done in bulk/cut cycles.
It is very likely that you will lose muscle on a diet so low in calories. Increase to 1500 and you will have a better chance of keeping your muscle and even building more.
Not if the 1200 calories is mostly protein and you continue working out.
As an active 17 year old female this is pretty much right to allow a regular weight loss of about 1kg (2lbs) per week. Your normal calorie intake should be 1,800 - 2,400 to give you an idea. It also depends on how "active" you mean by active.
Im 13 male and i have a lot of dirt on my skin since like few years ago. My neck, armpits crotch and butt. I tried using soap in my towel and rubbing it while in the shower but doesnt really help that much. And also, its hard cleaning the dirt on my butt. Are there any answers that doesnt need to buy materials or stuff, please answer. Thank you.
Yes
Showering twice a day and using a flannel and soap to wash yourself and a towel to dry yourself. When finished, always leave the shower clean and tidy for the next person and put your towel and flannel in the laundry or hang up to dry.
Soaking in a tub with lots of soap, bar soap, not the gel or shampoo sort, for an hour, do this more than once.
It is probably just the color of your skin if you are cleaning with soap and water. That is all that is necessary.
Disregard Lord, yes people can become retarded over time
Clinical trials (straight marriage) show that this happens to 50% of people. Interestingly, it was all of the males in the sample-set who demonstrated said "retarded" behavior. Studies show that there are only two ways to avoid this unfortunate outcome. 1) do not allow any high quality man to get lazy and bored while assuming the role of "husband", or 2) kill all of the men. :)
Good question. I know a guy in his mid thirties that works for his Daddy. Daddy even brings him lunch every day. This guy is an alcoholic, he cant even change a car battery. He works, drinks, and plays pool. Daddy solves all of his problems for him. Is this guy retarded?
People can lose brain function due to injury or disease or drug use. "Huffing" (inhalent abuse), in particular, makes normal people into retarded people. Many older people's brain functions decline.
No, never. They can ACT retarded or stupid. But they can never BE retarded unless they have a brain injury
no they can't
you haAVE
well i think i'm gay for the most beautiful girl in the world which sucks bc heck i preferred liking hot gay boy's than straight ponsey girls. had a maths internal on bivariate which i think went OK. almost had to do a history seminar on Osama bin Laden but our teacher was feeling sick so yussss got a 2 day extension. counselling with my dad wasn't my idea of fun, but it wasn't DREADFUL. today was okay kind of **** but OK
I'm good. How are you? xx.
I just yogurted!
im fine
Pretty bad :( how are you?
I have been there too! I had a extra long uvula, and it was beating my tonsils like a gong all night! I did sleep test and I had apnea, I could either sleep with the CPAP forever or get a UP3 surgery. I got the surgery and now my snoring is much better and I feel more rested and don t feel tired as much! Sleep apnea is not something to mess with, get it checked out, snoring is a MAJOR red flag for apnea!
Snoring happens when the tissues soften and slump into the airway. That is a symptom of B vitamin deficiency. Get B-100 or nutritional yeast. Vitamin B2 is a water soluble dye that turns urine bright yellow. So when the color fades, it's time for another pill. Read some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right.
My wife SNORES!!! I have been sleeping in another room to actually get sleep. She used to complain about it and even recorded me snoring when I did sleep with her. I feel it is my right to sleep alone in order to get the needed rest. If you two care about each other, you will respect the other's need to rest peacefully.
I had to do the same thing, slept in another room for years. When he quit drinking alcohol, the snoring was less. Then he talked to the doctor and they found a medical reason for the snoring... and it was solved completely, but we were divorced by then... (for other reasons.
No, do what you have to do. My mother sleeps with Bose noise-canceling earphones. My father snores like a foghorn but they choose to share a bed
Sleep in another room.
You should talk to a doctor if you're concerned. Can you find out when your mom started? You are likely to start at the same time, so if she was later, then there's probably no need to be concerned. Other causes that can delay periods are being underweight or being very physically active.
you can do the two things : Firstly, you can wait for a period ,because every people has different physical condition. Maybe the coming of your menstruation is rather late. Secondly, search for a doctor to ask for a help. make a series of examination, and then listen to the doctor's suggestions.
nothing to do other then wait, every woman is different. their is no magic pills to make to happen either
Go and ask your GP about it.
Your body weight fluctuates 1-3 lbs daily anyway.
When you "lost" weight it was water. When you "gained" weight it was water. Water accounts for most gains and losses between days.
Just eat a donut and hot dog too much
consult with doctor
Are you straining ? Are you regular? Try eating bran or taking Metamucil for a week, to soften things, Drink lots of water. You probably have a hemorrhoid (s). Hemorrhoids are nothing but varicose veins in the rectum. You need to be gentle with it and it can heal. Also try a Sitz bath,after going.
It's nerve damage, the rectum ending is chock full of nerve endings. Try hot Epsom salt baths, cures.me. And take magnesium supplements and drunk lots of water
You could have a build up of sperm (try masturbating) it happened to me once. You could have something caught in your pee hole or you could have a small cut in your penis.
hemoird
My worry is here mental health is only given highest predominance and emphasis. But at the same time, I don't want to displease you and Cu Tie. I am now in a dilemma. What to do. I will strictly go by your advice only.
If he's an atheist, try the Fruit of the Month Club.
Dude has a girl's name
Tell that nïgga I said happy burfday
Who?
Something for his prom date. Like bail money.
Fart mayonnaise pancakes outta your vagina for him.
No, it is not too big. Sounds pretty good actually.
Whoa. That's a small cack!
Your fine. You don't have to put it all in.
LOL... you don't know how to measure do you retard?
That'd work
To a doctor? Doesn't matter. Use whatever language YOU are comfortable with.
Just say "I went to the bathroom, and.....
just say I pooped
i dropped nuggets
i vomited from my anus
That's normal for teen ages, all you can do is mansterbate, mansterbate and bath, if you can't control adolescence, don't call big brother because you should ashame of it, so pm if you are a gay.
sure you can send me a message if you have serious questions. There are no perfect answers but I can probably help you figure things out.
I am. Im okay to answer your questions.
I am
if you mean that male circumcision will get rid of a yeast infection, then no. Yeast infection is a fungus, so take anti-fungal cream. Circumcised penises can get yeast infections as well, as do vaginas and in all cases the cream should work.
That's a rather drastic solution to the problem, when a suitable anti fungal cream will do just as well.
No, no reason that would happen.
How long did you take Zoloft and what dose? I tried Wellbutrin but didn't like it; maybe you would.----- Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Join Yoga and meditation classes and learn all their techniques systematically. In Yoga class they teach you lot of physical exercises coupled with some mental exercise in order to keep your body and mind always fit, trim and strong. If you have mental control, it is easy to control anxiety. Another important thing is illegitimate desire is the root cause for worries or anxieties. Try to avoid them.
Don't take any medicine. I have anxiety too And I know how hard it is to control it But I recommend you to drink tea every night (7 blossoms) And distract yourself go biking, hiking.. Etc
You probably shouldn't have just stopped the Zoloft. Everything you read about it says to taper off slowly. The sneezing and sinus problems are probably allergies and have nothing to do with your depression. I can't tell you how to be happy. You might want to see a therapist.
No, it is not a good thing but once it is done, it is done.
Circumcision is indeed a good thing as it provides a lifetime of proven health and sexual benefits with no drawbacks. Circumcision is not mutilation and does not remove "half his dick skin" although it does, of course, expose the glans (penis head) which is its purpose. Only the small amount of skin forming the foreskin is removed and this is usually not much more then the length of the glans.
I have an uncut pen** and I'm good with it. I take a bath evwryday and it's always clean. Many people have them cut while many others are like me, uncut. But people are born with it, so why cutting the foreskin? It's up to you.
No. That is just a marketing claim made by health food junkies to get people to buy expensive coconut oil.
Why not olive oil?
It reportedly can.
Maybe his explanations are valid. Worrying about your welfare, and talking about an ex beforehand...I think he's telling the truth. If you find this is a recurring problem aside from 'what's on his mind', maybe he needs to see a doctor. But for now, I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
I think you're going off the rails! He's not a machine. He gets to have a "down" day now and then. You disobeyed your doctor's orders you were so horny but cool your engines here about this. He has a renewable resource.. just perhaps not ever available at your slightest whim. It'll be fine.
it happens to most guys from time to time a woman can still preform if she's just not feeling it for whatever reason but a man can't
It's not a problem with you. It is simply a problem. He needs to see a doctor.
He really love you Difficulties to getting hard at such young age mean ;; a visit to the doctor Do not take it on yourself ;; he really as a medical problem

A healthy loss would be 1-2 pounds a week depending on how much you weigh now. You should not try to lose more than 1% of your body weight a week and all you need to lose weight is be in a calorie deficit so you can still eat the same foods you enjoy, just less of them.
I'm assuming you mean more than the normal 1-2 pounds by diet and regular exercise, otherwise why would you post this question? What makes people think they can lose weight like that in one week? You certainly didn't gain a lot in one week so you certainly aren't going to lose a lot in one week either. It takes time.
Bruce Jenner still has a penis, therefore is a mentally instable freak, not a tranny, and certainly not a woman.
Her name is Caitlyn. Pre-op transsexual woman usually sit down like other women to pee. By the way "transgender" and "transsexual" are adjective, not nouns, despite what your dictionary says. This is important because trans people have genders just like everyone else. Caitlyn and other transsexual women are female. Anyone born with a female gender identity, which transsexual women are, is female. .
He's still got his D and read he's changed his mind about being a tranny. All those numb skulls who have done it because it's trendy and following Hollywood will be disappointed LOL. They can't put the bits back.
They don't use the restroom because they're not human. they are mutant freaks who drink their own pee
that is one question my doctor used to ask me at every session

Prolargent 5x5 Extreme will keep you hard for a few days, no problems and you can go all night. Take a few hours before the fun begins, this won't disappoint you.
Practice. Premature ejaculation is not a medical problem. It's a practical issue. You just need practice that's all.
. I have ordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme 3 times and it has never failed once. Works as described. Very reliable.
Puberty started a good while back, dude, before you ever got pubes. Pubes are generally one of the first signs of puberty, hence the name: Pube-rty. Probably been in puberty well over a year or more. If you are just oozing drops those are simply precum, which most guys produce. Sounds like you have not yet figured out the right level of stimulation to actually ejaculate. Go slow and easy and focus on your arousal.
Youre on a puberty, those clear liquid is your precum and it is produced by your body, basically if you do it longer you can ejaculate, thats c.um or s.emen, its whitish body fluid so dont worry, its completely normal. We guys had been there.
Your fine. Pubic hair is the first sign of puberty.
Yes, you are in puberty. Gynecomastia is part of puberty for some boys. Yes, you should be ejaculating by now. So o.k., so far. < M
yes
Yes dumbass, PUBIC hair means PUBERTY
If you are 16 and 5'2.5, then supposedly yes that is a normal weight. I put your info into a weight calculator, so i could find what a normal/recommended weight for someone of your height and age. You fall in the range of 95 to 130 pounds (43 to 59 kg). You are on the lower side of the range though and personally you sound a little skinny.
That's pretty thin. I'm 5'3", 21 and weigh 112lbs and people tell me I'm skinny all the time... I'm trying to get to 115
That sounds very normal and healthy.
No, you are skinny!
Kelvin is wrong. That size is below average for your age. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. You should be around the average of 6 inches by now. Keep in mind just like height and everything else... Not all men have big penises. Some do but some have small ones.
Well you could grow until your late teens to early twenties. Keep in mind if your heavy then likely a bit of your size is lost in the fat that surrounds your penis on your pubis. Losing weight will cause you to gain inches.
Your penis at 4.5 inches is slightly below average, but still a good size.
I ordered a bottl e of Prolargentsize and it is absolutely the best product that you can use witho u t a prescription. I rate this item a 10 out of 10 and back it 110%. No doubt this product does everythin g it say s that it will.
First, lose weight. healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
your fine for your age
Probably an infection or ingrown hair from shaving. Ask a parent or guardian before wasting the doctor's time.
Cancer in that area usually doesn't hurt. It may be a cyst that is starting to get infected. You really should not let your mind go crazy with imaginings. Just wait and find out. It's really unlikely for you to have breast cancer at your age.
Go and see the Doctor.Nobody on here can help you, The lump has to be seen to give any kind of explanation,
Infection?
It is not anything serious. Perhaps a cyst..nothing more. I have had MANY of them in my years. Your doctor will put your mind at ease in virtually moments of seeing you.
Probably an ingrown hair or cyst but ask your doctor
So go see a doctor.
You wont be getting any nutrients. Theres nothing wrong with eating but just stay away from all junk food and try to have more of a Vitamin/ Protein intake. Now by this i dont mean cram a bunch of vitamins down your throat. But try eating vegetables and fish.
You'll die after a couple weeks but before that you'll be miserable. It's better to watch calories and exercise.
You get acidity. Ur stomach shrinks. U get a bad breath. U look into the mirror and no longer find u but a zombie.
Death
You'll die of malnutrition.
About 141 pounds.
64 Kg = 141.1 lbs
141 pounds.
64 x 2.2 = 140.8lbs
If 64 is in kg (kilograms) that would be 141.096 pounds
Don't worry, balanitis is a common disease in male reproductive system. It can be divided into the chronic balanitis and the acute balanitis. And many reasons may lead to this disease, such as trauma, local stimulation and various infections, etc. You could go to the hospital and get diagnosis from the doctors. While the conventional treatment towards balanitis is antibiotics. While a long-term use of biotics may cause side effects. However, some alternative treatments as Chinese herbs may also produce best curative effects to balanitis, Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill can be a good choice.
No, not on basis of your description. Sounds like you have torn phimotic ring at tip. No sex = let it heal for a week. Red blotches probably where you are ripping back foreskin before it has separated from glans. The white build up is simply your childhood seal breaking up. It's a bit late at 20. Doctor might prescribe steroid cream but should not do anything else at this stage. < M
Ask to be excused to go to the restroom? I don't think it's legal for a teacher to prevent you from using the restroom if that's what you have to do. If a teacher refuses to allow it, talk with your parents about this issue. I'm sure they will take it up with the administration.
privately- female teachers Have Periods too
Go at break. Your obsession with the young female teacher isn't healthy. Act like an adult, go to the toilet at break time.
by doing it in private
the same way you should told all of us
I make people suffer all the time. When it comes to the things that are illegal you just have to be careful not to leave evidence. If it all became legal I would go on an orgy of murder that would put Hitler and Stalin to shame.
As long as you are breathing right now, someone is watching you and you will be blasted away to the darkness if you think there are no consequences. From the second you touch someone and hurt their skin physically, you will hear a voice in your head, saying you are being watched and the filming begins to damn you further into the darkness. There are consequences. Every thing breathing is being watched and being punished for their evil deeds.
I really don't get how someone would make others suffer for pleasure...
yes, i would rob a bank and split the money between homeless people or those who need it most. the bank will suffer, but i will feel pleasured to do that for someone in desperate need of money.
How on earth could that give you pleasure?? Don't you feel people's pain when you see them hurting? Like, If I see a person crying it just feels like someones punched me in the stomach. I don't understand
no, certainly! -- other peoples' suffering is no matter of pleasure at all!
Waste of life
There would still be a consequence for me. Guilt.
No, I wouldn't, because I would feel bad for the people who were suffering.
You need to get an erection BEFORE you ever put on a condom. Some guys have aversions to condoms, so may go limp or semi-limp after putting one on. Others may wear ones that are too tight and that can cause loss of erection. Guys need to experiment and find the right size and fit for their particular gear.
You should be erect before putting the condom on.
You need to have an erection and your foreskin (if uncircumcised) fully retracted BEFORE putting the condom on.
Really good performance enhancer, similar to another one i took but has a bit more effectiveness than any other I have tried. Prolargent 5x5 Extreme is a must buy for extra power in the bedroom.
you are supposed to apply the condom after you have the erection
No. You have to be hard to get a condom on.
I was a bit skeptica l about buying Prolargent 5x5 Extreme. I love it and would definitely recommend to other people nee ding a little boost.
I'm 14 and getting a root canal soon. I'm really scared it will hurt even though A) I'm going to a trained professional (specifically for root canals) B) the tooth doesn't have an infection or abscess C) it's on a canine which is only 1 root instead of 3 like a molar. But still, they are digging out the insides of my tooth!!!
I have had about 6 root canals. They numb you so you don't feel anything. There is no pain during the procedure or afterward. It is about like getting a simple filling. Relax it is not a big deal.
they don't start until you are totally numb. you aren't going to feel it. if you have ever had a filling it is even less drilling than that. they only use the drill to make a small hole. After that there is no more noise and vibration because they use tiny files by hand to remove all the tooth's pulp and shape the canals, then they disinfect it and fill it
You will have a numbing injection and wont feel anything before or after. They are removing the nerve.
Usually the basic non electronical weights work the best and are more accurate.
Male tech doesn't work as well as they say. If women were allowed to design scales or at least have a voice, they would give the right weight.
Assuming you mean scales, either pick one to use daily, same time, or average them. I use two, a digital and an analog. They read the same and same at Dr's office within three lbs as I wear all my clothes there. If it bothers you, judge by your tape measure. Forget scales. If your clothing is looser, you lost. If tighter, you gained or are bloated.
you have to do the plus-minus thing (error allowance). so the number you see on the scale +/- 1 lb. scales aren't accurate to the decimal point.

The skin absorbs the water & gets 'bigger'. As the 'size' of your skin increases, it can't just hang, it's attached to your deeper tissues, so the accommodate this increase in size, it wrinkles....
The oils in the skin are being removed

No one here is a mind reader; I would suggest a therapist familiar with drug abuse. I used to abuse drugs and alcohol. I hated the world, everybody in it and myself. I had to learn how to get adjusted to life.
Better get your A** to the doctor or the emergency room and come clean, or the next drugs you take you will be dead.
for? you mean from, right?...just stop doing it
How on earth do we know why you do it????
See a therapist. You can't just talk yourself out of it, you need help. If you broke your arm, you would get help. If you were diabetic, you would get help. So why not for this? There is no reason you can't go to a counselor except you don't want to get better. Thanks to Obamacare, health insurance has to cover therapy like any other medical treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy is just about 8 sessions and can really help. You won't be five again. Being an adult is hard, but there are other joys. You have to be open to them and therapy can help.
If you get a headache do you go to bed and cry and whine about how much it hurts? Or do you take a Tylenol and get on with the day? Depression is the same.... you can sit there and whine while doing nothing to help yourself OR you can go to a doctor and try antidepressants and/or therapy. But as long as you are lying in bed complaining and expecting everyone to wait on you while you refuse any measure to actually help yourself... you don't have my sympathy. Depression can be treated.
Go to a doctor. Depression is often a medical problem, just like a broken leg or an infection. "Advice" doesn't help with any of those things. Medical treatment does.
Finger tips read bumps on a page. You can google Braile Alphabet
their's Sense of touch just like deaf people use eyes, Imagine what Helen Keller has been through, she's may is blind and deaf but she's not stupid as you think because she managed to learn sign language from sense of touch and managed to learn alphabet by time when she was little girl, and using her voice to speak when she was teenager, she is also Writer as beautiful woman before she died while being famous blind and deaf wrinkly old lady Hope that helps you to understand that Blind is may one of disability but their's live aren't disabled mentally.
Oh dear... The world at your hands and you cannot be bothered to do some simple, fast research and learn what Braille actually is before posting such an asinine question? Here is a start: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille
They glide their fingers over elevated text specifically made for blind people. The don't actually read it, they feel it.
The letters are easy to read with your fingers because they are slighlty higher.
They just have to use there sense of touch
You can't you're stuck with your penis being that size
not going to happen
You cant
No way to do that.
Jeez. Oxycodone for a headache?!? That's overkill. Figuratively and perhaps literally. Don't ever do that again.
I have his same problem with any narcotic. The number one side effect for most drugs is nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Drink some ginger ale and eat a few crackers. It should wear off in about 4 hours. Better to take acetaminophen or ibuprofen next time.
your supposed to take it with food or it can make you feel sick and nauseous. eat something.
Pray to God to heal your wounds.
Why not just take ibuprofen? 0_o

All porn is bad for children to see. And the women are almost always drugged or beaten into performing. Not to mention that those sites are full of viruses and malware that can really trash your computer.
That's more mild considering the disgusting fetishes on porn sites. Stay off them, kid. It will ruin your future (hopefully far future) sex life.
Liar, porn isn't allowed on youtube.
stay away from such material.
YES!
There's not really a guaranteed way you can make them grow, but you can promote a healthy growth, by not sleeping in a bra and such. I have really large breasts and I'm still a teenager, nobody in my family on either sides have big boobs, I started taking birth control when I was younger and that's when my breasts got big. I know other girls that has happened to also.
Short of surgery, there is no way to make your breasts grow. Your breasts are mostly fat, and no pill, cream, massage, ringtone, exercise, etc. can change the amount you have there. Your breasts will be the size they were genetically predetermined to be.
By massaging your boobs it will promote breast growth. Massaging your boobs will make your blood flow through them it will pick up the receptors which will make your boobs larger.
I'm sure you're perfect the way you are. I'm 5'3 and 118 and I'm 16! People say how skinny I am all the time and still hate my body even tho I'm skinny for my size. Im sure you're beautiful and that's amazing even loosing 22 pounds! You go!
Maybe it's in your head. Maybe you are so focused on being healthy that you are starting to think you are fat. It happens to me also. I'm in my 20's , 5'3.5 ,88lbs and a size 0. I always tend to be careful not to get over 98lbs because when I do I feel sluggish and tired . Therefor I'm so hard on myself sometimes I feel fat. If you need to try being at 110lbs a little underweight hurts nobody.
at age 21 trust me you're not fat, keep working out eating a lot of healthy food like chicken fish rice and vegetables and you will start to 'look' better. Your weight doesn't determine how healthy you are.
the normal weight for a 5'5" tall person is 143lbs. the ideal weight for a 5'5" tall lady is 122lbs. the current weight of 123lbs is about the ideal weight, 115lbs is underweight, unhealthy and will not look attractive.
Keep going. send pics.
Circumcision is not mutilation. It is done in many cases for problems with the foreskin. If done as an adult you certainly are more aware of any discomfort. As an adult it is your decision so no one can say it was done against you will when you were too young to protest. It will not reduce sensation.
Circumcision is good for your health
She's a bully. In most cases, I'd say that you should just ignore her, but if you see her all the time at school/work, that may not help. You'll have to stand up to her and say how you truly feel when she gives off that type of attitude. It's also a good idea to report it to your teachers, a counselor, your parents, or any other authority figure. You don't need proof; just tell them about what's happening and they'll help.
She's a bully, aka a pathetic individual that's own self-esteem is so low they need to put others down in order to feel less inferior. Bullies always secretly feel inferior to their victims. That's why she is targeting you so much. Something about you makes her feel insecure, because if she truly felt she was better than you, she wouldn't focus on you. Don't let this girl get to you, but don't let her get away with her actions either. Tell an adult. Tell your parents, teachers, and report her if it continues. And don't be afraid to stand up to her and ask her what her problem is.
She seems insecure. Are you pretty? This could be one of two things, and I'm gonna be brutally honest with you. If you are pretty, she may see you as a threat, and is just jealous. Or if she is obviously prettier than you, then she's just another b*tch. If you're pretty, just ignore her insults, and be nice, and people will start to like you because you will be the nice pretty girl, and people will think she is pathetic for being so mean. But if you're ugly, I suggest fighting back. People tend to be more cruel to unattractive people. So you got nothing to lose. Bully her. Beat her up if you have to.
Sounds like she is doing it to make herself feel better. She may not tell anyone about it or even know that is doing that. But Most of the time why things like this happen all they are trying to do it look good for someone else. It probably has nothing to do with you yourself
Her problem is that she's just well and truly a *****. You're doing the right thing by ignoring her, but if it starts to get you down too much don't hesitate to tell a teacher.
Why not ask HER what her problem is? You sure are giving her a lot of power over your life. Next time she does that to you just ask, "Is there a problem?" When she backs off, and she most likely will, say, "Yeah, I thought not". Block her from FB and every other social media. Enlist help from others; tell a teacher or your parent.
Tell the guidance coupler or a principal, she is a bully. Block her on Facebook and any other social media so she won't have your pictures. Hope this helped :)
It's time to speak to your guidance counselor or principal. Her bullying should be stopped immediately there is no excuse for her behavior. And she needs to be stopped.
well it's a cold and you need lots of rest
YES YOU HAVE CAUGHT A COLD. I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU! get well soon :)
yes
Prob more towards the flu.
I'm going to skip all the details of why I think I have bipolar disorder, but my parents hate when I ask to get tested for anything. They always tell me that I'm making it up for attention. I swear to them that I'm not, but they never believe me. Asking for help always ends with me in tears, my mom terrified, and my dad angry. I know there's something wrong with me, but I want to get tested and get help, but I don't know how to ask my parents for help.
Go talk to your school counselor or nurse and ask for help in talking to your parents. Maybe input from a third party will help get the process moving forward.
Ask them if they think you are bipolar then start a conversation about your concerns and just ask
Your arms, hands, and fingers, like the rest of your body, contain muscles (obviously!). Therefore, overuse of the muscles can cause degradation of the muscle fibers. The pain may likely just be your body repairing itself. Alternatively, to focus on your joints. You may have a lack of cushioning in your joints (I m not a doctor by any means). However, joints strength can/may be improved by taking fish oil tablets. Perhaps you re deficient in that? I ve gone into this further in an article written below.
I used to play 6-8 hours a day when I started also. The only thing that ever got sore were my fingertips. It could be that you are pressing on the strings too hard. Sometimes I get this problem when switching from a 12 string acoustic to an electric.
Obviously the finger pain is from playing way more than usual,that happens to me also. The whole wrist thing though is a bit odd. One way to tell if it's developing carpal tunnel is to shake your hand around sort of violently. If you're starting to get carpal tunnel then whatever pain you're feeling will go away temporarily while you're shaking your hand.
Your fingers and wrist are muscles. Muscles get sore from a lot of use. 8 hours a day is alf use. nothing to worry about

I don't know why a girl that age would. Most girls don't even start having sex until 14 or 15.
Sure, they can even have orgasms. Many a young girl enjoys rope climbing or sliding down handrails for the stimulation. However their bone and genitals structure isn't very large yet. Most of them couldn't handle an adult and could be very painful. And none of them are mature enough to handle it emotionally.
yes silly. Muslim women start having sex when they are about 5 years old
It's physically possible, but the immature anatomy involved isn't designed for it.
An immature female body is not meant to have sex... period.
how old are you to actually ask that sort of questions? the answer is obviously not. it can cause harm to your female parts and you might become infertile.
They can but only with a pedophile.
consult with doctor
it would be considered rape since they are little girls

Thats normal. In order to hear your heart correctly she has to remove you shirt, but she also could have just reached her stethoscope under your shirt instead. All doctors do it differently and this isnt anything to worry about because she is a professional.
Absolutely normal.
Yes it is completely normal. I have a MAN Doctor and he has done that for years.
Normal. The heart has 4 chambers, so to effectively listen to all 4 chambers, she would need to move the stethoscope around the various places. She is listening to be sure that the blood is flowing correctly thru each one.
I don't see what other way the doctor would have to listen to your heart, do you?
yes it is normal
They have also helped me stay playing with the girls for a longer period. I have understood from my previous experiences that if a guy finishes off quickly, the girl never gets satisfied and still needs something more. Prolargentsize has helped me end that desire and completely exhaust a girl to her end.
yes your size is quite normal and in the average range. perhaps you need to learn the art of foreplay. size has little to do with the pain of being rushed to penetration before sufficient arousal
Maybe try lots of foreplay with her first then go in slow and don't go rough make it as comfortable with her as possible and let her kknow that she can say stop
Above average, but certainly not freak show big. http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/penis...
your size is fine and your doing it wrong if all she feels is pain
Your penis is bigger than average.
ARE YOU GETTING HER AROUSED AND WET BEFORE INTERCOURSE?
Ok so i wen't to the the eye doctor yesterday and it turned out i needed glasses because i'm nearsighted. They come in a couple of days and i'm just scared everyone will stare at me and will just make fun of me! I know i probably sound immature and childish right now but I don't wanna face myself in front of everyone! I'm just scared people will just treat me different. And I don't really like a lot of attention. If anyone has glasses have you felt this way before? How did you get through it? What happens if people make fun of me?
hi! i am farsighted and i have been wearing glasses since i was 13 years old. If someone starts up with you at school,just ignore,and please wear your glasses so that way you won't be blind in the future.i have and still feel this way alot. Back when i was a sophomore in high school,one girl said to me,in my english class,"take off the glasses.you look like a geek". Just ignore the rude comments and proudly wear your glasses in pride.
Chances are, no one will even notice. When I started wearing contacts, people I had seen daily at school for five years claimed 'they did not know I wore glasses.' No one EVER notices one as much as one thinks they do.
The reaction will depend on where you live. In my neck of the woods kids don't make fun of those who wear glasses, actually many girls will wear fake ones as part of their look or whatever.
I felt the same way the first time I wore my glasses to school, but I was worrying over nothing. At first they looked at me weird because they werent used to seeing me in glasses, but then they got used to it. If they make fun of you just ignore their stupidity and move on.
You and your friends will get over it soon. Relax. And just know that almost all of your friends will need glasses at some point of their lives. Some sooner than others.
well, you have no choice if you want to see
It may knock out. If you wanna knock out you oppenent then give them a surpise hard punch. They will get ko right away. Important thing to notice you should know how to punch or else you will hurt yourself.
Who do you wanna punch your mom 😂
You will be thrashed haha
Violence is never the answer
Well, I suffer from panic attacks from my anxiety. It is usually triggered by something, or it could just be out of the blue. It differs from person to person, however.
Not necessarily. The attack may be triggered by a chemical imbalance in their brains that they have no control over.
Yup
The best thing is to ask what he wants, is interested in or what turns him on. From my experience, guys like it when a chick is into the sex. Noises, movement or flat out saying what feels good will do that. I move a lot, get handsy and tell him when I want to try a different position which seems to turn him on. Every guys is different though. No one likes a cold fish though, someone who just lays there silently and just takes it.
When he's laying in bed get him comfortable get some clothes pins and put him on his nipples. Then kick his balls a couple of times, jump up and down on the bed then body slam him. Then handcuff him to the bed post..get a 10 inch dildo and penetrate his butt hole. When he moans and screams and he yells '' DEAR GOD " you know he's satisfied.
excitement. a strap on? i don't know what your guy is into. but ask him what ways you can do to spice it up. Not only will this get him thinking he might need to get more it will get you both to talk abut what you want.
I think the problem is many men are dispassionate, watch too much porn or are just plane lazy in bed. (or all 3). I don't know what tricks will work, and some women were just lucky to have a guy who is interested. You give him bj's, maybe stop doing that.
Sex with enthusiasm is always funny. If you aren't getting into it how can he?
Guys love anal sex. Buy the biggest strap-on you can find and give it to him good. It's also a huge turn on for most guys to make a video of yourself banging another dude and let your husband watch it.

For the past four months I ve had a random spurts of lower stomach pain, it s usually whenever I eat food either right after or in the middle of eating food I start to get a stabbing pain in my lower stomach that makes me need to go to the bathroom and while I am going to the bathroom,throw up it s definitely not cramps because these hurt a lot worse, and they never happened during my period I have no idea what is happening because I just started getting them, and I would be lying if I said I was just a little bit worried
I'm no nurse or doctor but it could be an ulcer possibly. They are caused by stress and very painful. It would be a sharp and burning pain. Try eating things that aren't at all spicy or acidic and see if that helps
I would go see a doctor. It might mean that there's a serious problem.
you got stomach cancer and youre going to die
Go to your doctor. It will help
?IBS. Impossible to say much given your limited history. You need to see your doctor.
So my bmi is 24.9 and I weight 132 lbs and I'm 4'11-5 ft. So I already lost 5lbs yay!! But it took like a month. My uncles wedding is coming up and I've been telling myself oh it's 2 weeks away oh its a month away and basically putting it off and now I realize its next Friday!! I got this super cute dress and I wanna lose weight bc the I want my collar bines to be more prominent. Any tips I've got 9 days!! Thnx gurll
"10 POINTS BEST ANSWER!! HOW TO LOSE 10-15LBS IN 9DAYS!! URGENTTT!! Plz answer need tips!!?" You can NOT lose that much weight in nine days. At most you MIGHT lose is four to five pounds. There are no fast ways, or tips that will help you to lose ten to fifteen pounds, in nine days. That's the bitter harsh brutal blunt force and even a bit cruel truth.
You can't. Simple as that. Eat a healthy diet at maybe 75% of maintenence and avoid anything that retains water like sodium.
in 9 days! well starve yourself would be the only way. but thats crazy. you cant loose 10-11 pounds in 9 days without harming yourself.
It can't be done. Not without significant risk to your health anyway.
Just eat fruits and vegetables
Sure But know that the sauses they use are either very salty or very high in sugar.
yes it does
Why, is there something wrong with them?
Sure, why not?
Currently I'm signed up for honors anatomy next year but I was thinking of changing it to ap physics. Which one would be better if I want to be a dentist? I was planning on talking ap bio senior year but I could always take anatomy if i end up taking physics junior year. So, which one should I do? Physics or anatomy?
Dental schools don't really care what you took in High School. AP classes might look better on college applications but dental school cares about how you did on the DAT (dental school entrance exam) and your college grades. Anatomy might help you more in gross anatomy in dental school, but how much are you really going to remember from HS to D School with 4-5 years between?
Anatomy.
You will need both, take one at a local community college and the other pick take the course in school.
Let the dealer run the convo. Just text them and be like hey, I'm so and so and I got your number from so and so and would like to talk to you about getting something. Or whatever, keep it generic and if he texts back and talks about drugs he has or prices then it's fine, if he uses some weird code or calls you, then it's a damn good thing you didnt say anything about drugs or prices and you should go with the flow. Good luck!
Just say a mutual friend said you. Oils help me out. The dealer will take it from there
He is a serious dealer Jimmy lol i dont think he would respond to that
Say this: "Hi, yeah, I'd like to order a family box, extra gravy, fries and WITH EXTRA LETTUCE" The bit in caps is a message all dealers know, its like the illuminati. Let me know how it works for you!
It is right time for you to negotiate for a lesser price. Please don't tell anybody about this top secret.

If you've done any illegal drugs in the past month or so, I'd say you're seriously screwed.
If your clean (which you should be)it will be all good. You should not need to cheat... Why does it matter anyway?
Open your mouth,thats it.
Don't abuse drugs.
No
Fast food is not healthy here. They do offer salads but are also unhealthy (mostly the salad dressing, and iceberg lettuce) try to pack fruits, nuts and other snacks. American food is not good to stay slim. You can resort to sandwhich shops for lunch. Not as fast as fast food but not a sit down resturant. Also look into healthy grocery stores where they have a deli section of salads and other foods you can purchase on the go.
Every fast food chain offers a meal size salad now. Just make sure you get it with grilled (not crispy) chicken. McDonald's wraps are not too evil either. I have found the Wendy's Grilled Chicken sandwich to be good. It is usually number 5 on the menu board.
I suggest Taco Bell. Kidding. Why even eat fast food? Spring time = farmers markets. You have options
salads and Subway sandwiches.
Likely hemorrhoids or a fissure (small tear in the anus from hard stool). Eat more fiber (apples with skin, oatmeal, etc.) and drink more water to make going easier. If this continues, see a care provider.
Nothing, that area is sensitive, small cuts can often occur. They heal quickly, its nothing to worry about. If there is continuing amount of excessive blood then maybe see your doctor. But if its a small amount, do not worry, it happens
That's called constipation. Eat more fiber, drink more water, and stay Physically Active.
your just pushing too hard and need to eat more fiber
Too many hot cheetos
Unfortunately, no one can force your dad to stop drinking unless you're under 17 years of age and feel threaten than yes, the courts can intervene. The other way to get him help is if you can video record him driving behind the wheel of a car while he's drunk than you can call the cops and he will be arrested and he will get the help needed. Its unfortunate it may have to be in jail but no one helps unless tragedy occurs.
My dad was the same, honestly it's all up to him. My father was a alcoholic and he was ruining our lives, but then something happened. He went too far one night and ended up in the hospital which made him realize he has a FAMILY to provide for. He got his act together and went into agriculture and we now own, thanks to his hard work, 200 acres of farmland and live in a million dollar house. Try to make him understand what he;s doing
Perhaps have a family intervention. Get everyone together and confront him. Tell him that you are going to take action via a lawyer if he refuses to get help.
It has been done before- but you wouldn't need to go that far. After his suicide attempt, he should have been hospitalized. If they did not keep him and treat him properly, then you could look into getting him committed, yes. You'd need a lawyer.
hate to say it but your father is in denial and he has to admit to himself he has a problem before he will get any type of help
He needs mental help immediately. Contact your nearest drug rehab ASAP!!
In therapy and from mental health professionals they told me three things contribute to mental illness development, environmental and internal. Environmental being past and present memories, home life, family, friends, horrific memories, school life and more. Internal being family health history, effects caused by memories/horrific moments, are own out looks, are own developments through life and how we view things. A bad mixture of any of these can cause mental health issues I'd say. Mine was caused through family problems, family health history, horrific/tramatic memories and other issues. Itsall mix and match depending on the person really
Religion, but now I'm an atheist and I don't have a mental illness anymore.
Speaking of blame will not help those who suffer in this way. There are as many causes as there are sufferers s physical, emotional, cultural, criminal factors may play a part, the main thing in my mind is to seek to find ways to make their lives better in the here and now and to continue to seek and find answers for the future.
The concept of there not being another life is quite depressing, yet the fact we may be wasting our only chance arguing, fighting or going to war with one another over the different ideas of an afterlife is disturbing, as the Beatles say "live and let live", society tends to not allow us to live or let live sometimes we ourselves stop ourselves from living to fit in or isolate or selves to get away from society none the less we must remember in or darkest hour you may find the lift you are searching for is within, you just have to let it shine , I guess that's one factor
I hate you mental illness with a passion!
Could be done in growth- average guy gets full adult size by 14-15 but some guys grow early- and you are about an inch above adult average already. So could be done but well hung. Girth may continue to grow for a year or more.
Assuming you've measured it correctly, it may be done growing. Occasionally, penile growth can develop early/quickly and the remainder of puberty plays 'catch up'. The process is the same for everyone, but the order in which it occurs varies from one guy to the next. Some can ejaculate before they get pubes; some can have armpit hair before they can c*m; and others are shaving at 13 y.o.
Lucky boy to have a penis that is nearly six and a half inches long! Hopefully your penis is done growing. I don't think you really want it to be much bigger. Girls don't like it if a boy's penis is too big.
What a lame troll. 13 year old little boys don't have fully developed, adult sized penises.
Pistachios are about 25g/serving (1 cup). Brazils are 20ish. Almonds are good too. Peanuts are pretty bad, especially if you don't know any better and get them cooked in oil and flavored. Most hippie stores and some big chains have small hippie sections where you can get them raw in bulk.
Tree nuts. I have always believed Walnuts to be the most nutritious, but I have no proof.
Almonds

There's a very simple solution: track your calories. You need to set a daily calorie goal. Start with something like 1800-2100 calories. Weigh in every day and at the end of each week, average your daily weights. Monitor progress from week to week. If your weight goes up, reduce your calorie goal by 200 calories. If your weight is the same, reduce your calorie goal by 100. That really all there is to it. But you HAVE TO STICK to your calorie goal.
I recently started a diet, and i knew i needed something to give me that extra push. So i went a head and ordered Weight Loss Green Store Tea .since using it i don't feel as hungry and feel more energetic. So far ive lost 10 pounds in a week and a half. I'm loving my results.
Well hold on there partner. You can gain weight after building muscle. What happens is the muscle takes the place of the fat so you might be (insert number here) of muscle but not of fat. For example John Cena is 251 pounds but it's all muscle none of it is fat. The key is finding out if what you weigh is because of fat or muscle. :) hope this helps!
Healthy foods can be fattening if you eat too much of them. If you reduce your caloric intake and burn more calories you will lose weight.
First off, you can still overeat with healthy foods. You have to make sure you are at a caloric deficit to lose weight.
Just a coincidence. Herbalife supplements do not contain flu virus.
Thanks everyone....well I think the flu-like symptoms have kinda gone away but I'm still feeling icky with a cough, runny/stuffy nose, maybe now I have a cold, hope it's nothing else & hope it goes away soon, I already missed going to the gym last Wed. & Fri. I really don't want to miss going this week...but I don't think it's gonna be gone by Monday....I hate being sick

Eat yogurt like Activia. Get ginger in capsules and take them with every meal. For motion sickness , take them 20 min before you get in the car.
Just eat real food. Fresh meat. Fresh veggies. Very little of anything else.
Greatly limit sugar and synthetic food. Eat greens and fiber.
Eat properly, avoid fad diets, avoid restrictive diets. reject advice from health food junkies, avoid taking advice from chiroqwackors, naturoqwacktors and other varieties of new age witchdoctors.

Depression is due to your brain producing insufficient serotonin. Depression is common but easy to treat. --- Prozac is an old medication; Zoloft is much better. It enables your brain to produce sufficient serotonin so you can function correctly. --- But does take 2-4 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. --- But, after that, you will feel like a new, happy, confident person. So give it another try. -- Remember God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
Many are as doctor's like to push them and people would rather mess up their brain then help themselves. Many can't come off because the side effects of coming off are so bad. Those that are on them long term turn into robots and they report they wish they had never started.
Medical science may find a cure, new things are happening every day, but otherwise you will likely be on meditation from here on out.
Yes you will. My husband has...for the past 20 years. don't know what he would do without them.

Sleeping naked does allow the body to breathe, prevent belly fat no.
Perspire without accumulation so you sleep drier, and is it more comfortable? Yes, certainly. Does it prevent belly fat. I wish, but I doubt it.

No and no.
It is a bit odd to masturbate that many times in one day, but you do you. As long as you don't do it nearly every day, I'd say you're fine. But unless you want to be harshly judged, I suggest to not tell people about how often you do that.
You are as perfectly normal as it gets. ALL teenage boys masturbate 6 times a day some days, but I doubt that's the all time record. It's not bad at all, in fact it's good.
No, it's not bad, it's actually healthy to masturbate often. Just don't get too aggressive with it because you could hurt yourself
haha you do you
Most people are saying you're above average which is true, but thats in length. 2 inches in girth is below average and that is really really skinny. Mine is 4.5 inch girth and that's already skinny so 2 inches...yea. But it is the truth. Good Day! Edit: someone in the comments said u might have meant 2 inches in diameter. If thats the case you're above average and you have no issue 😂😂😂.
Your penis is larger than about 90% of all men. So definitely above average.
I am 17. I think your penis will grow fast during 13,14,15 years old. I remember i had very small penis when i was about 12 years old and know i have 6.1 inches.
Larger than average. It's big actually!
You are above average. Average is about 5.5-6 depending on where you live.
Way less than 5% of all men are 7.5 inches dude.
Your above average dude
That's a decent size, I suppose,
This Prolargentsize product is wonderful, I implore whoever that is willing to give it a trial to go ahead. Quite and perfectly sure that a trial will convince you. Thumb up cheers .......!!!
Bruh.. Your above average
You're definitely on the skinny side. However, if your overall health is good, I wouldn't worry. You're a teenager (barely) and you may just have a high metabolism. Don't go crazy, though, trying to put on weight.
yes. My friend is 4'5 and she is 70 pounds.. and is 13
you are really skinny for someone who is 5'5 feet tall. so um yeah i'd say it's bad
-That's kinda on the "light" side... Any Chance You can pick up 10 Pounds- or So ?! :o
Bad. Very bad.
Very unlikely
yes there is a chances of grow if you regularly do some exercises.
No. Youve stopped.
you don't stop growing when you get your period
No. It's child abuse. Chiropractic is not appropriate for any condition a part from maybe lower back pain. Chiropractors who use spinal manipulations to treat non-muscular skeletal conditions are nothing more than quacks and charlatans. It's high time that chiropractors be stopped from making exaggerated claims and banned from advertising their non evidenced based therapies.
Since chiropractic is based on quackery, you have to ask yourself if you would want to subject a child to this. Some chiro-quackery is dangerous, and some is just plain laughable....https://vimeo.com/45731626 Can you imagine actually paying someone for a tappy-tap session that does absolutely nothing?
Yes, it's appropriate. We take our daughter for regular adjustments and it helps with her asthma. She said she feels like she can breath easier after she's had an adjustment. I'm not sure why most of these fools are on this site if they don't believe anything other than drugs can help with someone's ailments.
No, chiropractors will fill the child's head with nonsense.They are vestigial Victorian travelling fairground bone-cracking mystics and charlatans who have appropriated the garb of the modern health professional.
absolutely, in fact, the origin of most health problems is from nerve interference which begins in most cases before adolescence. the stupid person tries to suppress symptoms with toxic drugs. the smart person takes their child to a real doctor who knows how to correct the cause, thus resolving the source of current problems as well as prevent future ones developing.
it depends on what exactly is wrong.....but it is usually older people in need...my 1st visited a chiro was at 16yo, had slept funny, could not straighten out my neck.....and was fixed in just one visit, by a world famous blind lady chiro...she was just what I needed....too bad, todays chiros are not trained the old school way....if you find one, count your blessings
yes, after 10 years of bedwetting my grand-nephew was cured of it with a few adjustments to his back.
My advice is you use the desire/energy for good works. Promise yourself you will not watch or masturbate unless ALL your chores or tasks are done. This means school work, laundry, room clean, etc. If there are things un-done, you don't get to indulge. This turns the lust/energy into positive work, and you get a small personal reward for doing good. Being an adult is NOT about a strict denial of things. It's learning a balance. Make sure you have a balance in this. Stay safe.
It can be difficult. Pray and ask God for strength. If you haven't been, go to confession. Receiving the sacraments brings sanctifying grace which is important in our desire to follow Christ and turn from sin. If you give into temptation, go back to confession again. If there are triggers for you, try to avoid them. Keep a Bible by your bed, and if you feel tempted, read scripture, say the Creed, or a Rosary. As you know pornography and masturbation are grave sins. Spend time in front of the Blessed Sacrament if you are able. Before and after Mass, spend time in prayer asking God to heal you and help you. Believe me he will.
If you end your life now you'll never give it a chance to get better. You should talk to someone about your feelings as it will help a lot just letting them out. Don't bottle up your emotions and just find someone who will listen to them for a while.
Don't bottle up your emotions. You need to find someone who can listen to them for awhile. If you end your life then you have lost the chance to get better. Try and be positive. I'm sure that you can overcome these obstacles
It's not belated bereavement. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft if you are at least 16. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Penis is already above adult average, no problems there, and girth should increase the next year but length should be done. SOme guys just look younger than other guys, just genetics. Upside is you'll look younger when you will be 30 or so.
Where did you get the idea that all guys are large, hairy, muscular beasts who have long penises? Some guys are small, with very little body hair, no muscle and have a small penis. That's just life kid. We're all different. Accept it and move on. And no, it's not likely your penis is going to grow any more than it is now. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. That's normal.
There are two kinds of jet fuel, Jet-A and JP4. Every barrel of JP4 is different, so there is no telling what might happen. In the case of Jet-A, nobody seems to know how toxic it is. If you drank a quart of it you would likely throw up, so it would depend on how much of it was left in your body. You would be unlucky to die quickly, more likely you would fry your liver and need a transplant. Then you get to spend the rest of your life on anti-rejection drugs. Don't confuse jet fuel with avgas, which is extremely toxic because of the very high lead content.
I'm more intrigued how you intend getting a quart of Av-gas...
Depends what you class as "okay" if death or hospital sounds good to you, then go for it.. although I highly don't recommend.
you'll die after one ounce, Mr Wiizard
no you can't
It can temporarily, especially if you do not normally have any. It does _not_ cause a permanent increase. If you regularly drink reasonable amounts of coffee, your body compensates and your blood pressure returns to normal. A moderate, regular intake of coffee has been shown over the last few years to be beneficial to your heart and circulation, not harmful. Any sudden large amount like a high-caffeine energy drink or a six-shot coffee will have adverse affect, even if only to give you the "caffeine shakes"... Like other things, "in moderation" is ok. (Tea is actually the harmful one, against all the old health myths - it significantly increases the chances of people developing arthritis).
Coffee contains caffeine (even the so-called "decaffeinated" coffee), which is a diuretic. The body needs fresh water for its many functions and can't use the water from coffee - it's contaminated. This promotes dehydration, which is the underlying cause of high blood pressure.
yes,it increase blood pressure
Drinking more than four cups of coffee a day may increase your blood pressure.If you know more about parches a coffee online so please visit here javatimescaffe.com
It can I'm not suppose to drink caffeine cause of me heart
yes it does, its a stimulate.
I recently found out I have scoliosis, and my torso is extremely short already. My 5 foot one inches tall mother has a longer torso than I do, I have no idea how the genes played out this way but I am 5 6 and all legs. I m already struggling with some back pain (and I m only 20), and while I always planned on having kids, I have no idea where the child would fit inside me or if it will be too much with my already existing back problems. Thanks!
My sister has this (severely, surgically treated) and had 3
I have know women short and same problem have babies. Gheck with OBGYN
You need to talk to your gyno about this.
I am 5'6/170cm and I weigh 128 pounds. I really don't like the way my body looks. I realize I am at a healthy weight, but I don't like it. I want to be comfortable in my own skin. I want to lose about 25 pounds. Please give me a good diet to go by, and help me figure out how long it will take to reach my goal. Thank you!!
I agree with "Serene E". If you're a 5'6" adult female your ideal weigh is between 110-130 lbs. You are still about a muffin and a couple biscuits under your upper limit weight and no more then 18 above your lower limit. If you wanted to lose a few pounds the best way is to cut sweets and increase your veggies. With a good diet & exercise you should be there in 1.5-2 months.
In less than two weeks, I've noticed a decrease in my appetite along with more stamina during workouts. Without question, Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea has exceeded my expectations .
THERE IS NO REASON TO LOSE WEIGHT!!!! You're 5'6, dear! 110-130 would be your normal weight.
Some do and some girls don't do it, but they use more than one private parts to have some romantic time ourselves.
Some do and some don't. Do what you wanna do (You are a girl, right?)
yes why not look up some certain 'educational' videos on google and learn what they get up to
Usually... unless I've been doing it wrong.....
They will be along to answer soon.Where are they ????
no never
I don't think it could hurt .After all you use it in your mouth don't you .It may even have an antiseptic in it .Use it until you can get the proper stuff
NO !!!!! a bit of apple cider vinegar on it.....let it soak in, let it air dry and don't cover it
dabbing it with an alcohol swab will be better then apply tincture iodine
NO.

You do have to wonder at the claims made in this section about penis sizes , i laugh when i see silly kids obsessing about the size of their penis, its funny because there is absolutely nothing they can do to alter the size anyway unless they wendt through cosmetic surgery . Anyway most normal guys have a normal sized penis which would be around 51/2 to 7 inches in length. the Male penis has evolved along with the female vagina (6 inches in depth) to be almost identical lengths and depths. This is so that the female cervix isnt damaged by and overly long penis during love making..
Most go further and say 7 or 8 inches. But fact is, most guys know it is unlikely anyone will challenge them in front of other guys about their size since they would be branded "gay" if they asked to see a guy's erection.
Its part of survival tactics to overcompensate, like competition and telling masculinity. Thats why its called survival of the fittest.
Yes most of them are and I dont know why as female vagina is only 4 inches long so it is quality we want rather than quantity
Mine is 3 inchs but i tell everyone its a lot bigger tgan that
I got eight inches...pics on request
Yea many lie about their size
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme is one of the most stimulating pills I have taken. It actually last 3 to 4 days. I highly recommend this one. No headache or side effects. It really should be in every store out there.
There aren't really any safe ones at all. The herb Gingko Biloba has some benefit & is usually safe for most.
just do a search for natural sex enhancer...you 'll find horny goat weed and tribulus among others....
What is she/he complaining about? If you aren't doing the things that she says then sue her for slander.... if you ARE doing the things she is complaining about then either stop doing them or show HR that you are allowed to do whatever it is she's complaining about.... LOL, I read your other questions... I would complain about you too... you are creepy and you need to stop spying on your coworkers...
Your under military. I hope not.not a lot of recourse. Ask for different assignment
Find out what they are complaining about and take a good, honest look at yourself. Can you change anything? Or should you change jobs?
either talk to them or find a new job

Yes, girls still get periods at 16, 26, 36, 46, up to about 52, because you don't know this at 16 I am assuming you're a male. It may be worth asking her what happened. Blood on the floor? In the sink? This is not necessarily a good thing although keep in mind she may have been trying to wash out her clothes. Please ask her, she may have got her period yes, but it could have been something more serious.
"Still get periods at 16"? Women have periods from the ages of even 10 or 12 to about their mid 50's. Blood in the toilet and the floor though? That seems excessive. You need to simply ask her what happened. She may have had a serious problem or she may have harmed herself in some manner.
yes you still get periods at 16, they do not stop until sometime around 50, but getting a period does not make leaving blood all over the floor or sink normal behavior
"I don't know if you still get periods at 16". If you STILL get periods at 16? That's about the dumbest statement I think I have ever read. A woman can still get periods when she is 50, for God's sake! "I don't know much about periods". Boy! .. you sure got THAT right!
Sounds like she might be and why shouldnt a girl get a period at 16, normally you get them monthly from around 14-50 years old.
Unless you're swallowing it it's not going to your stomach
Nope.
Yes sometime you feel it
Not usually, apparently. < M
in her stomach when she swallows ?
Where fat from weight gain is deposited in the body is largely determined by genetics. But, one's current hormonal state will play a role in where fat from weight gain is deposited as well. For example, individuals with diabetes or PCOS will tend to gain weight in the midsection. It should also be noted that as you gain weight, your estrogen levels will eventually go up more significantly than what is considered healthy. Estrogen leads to fat being deposited in the midsection, breasts, thighs, and buttocks. Hope that helps! RDG
You cannot 'manipulate' how your body stores fat. Yes, genetics plays a good part in that. But, what gender you are does also.
It's determined by body type. You could be naturally skinny but if you gain weight it will go straight to your stomach so it's in your best interest to stay fit and healthy. If you're a pare shape it will go to your butt,stomach and legs. If you are an apple shape it will go everywhere. If you are hourglass it will go to your boobs , hips and stomach . And so on...
You can't manipulate where you put it on or where it comes off.
That sounds like classic bipolar disorder. There are good treatments available if you can get him to talk to a mental health professional.
Does he have a job? Does he care for you? Provide you with a home? Food? Clothes? Then exactly what is it you want to do? If your father is functional then he doesn't need a teenager trying to play psychiatrist on him. Bipolar Disorder interferes with your ability to function. If he functions then leave him alone.
Alcohol is a depressant, so he will only get worse unless he stops or goes into rehab. He/you should tell a dr. about this and ask for antidepressants. Zoloft is the best one. Melatonin (otc) will help him sleep at night.
Clearly he needs to see a mental health professional.
Carbs are not the reason why you are not losing weight. If you want lose weight and feel great all at the same time cut out the meat, dairy, and egg products and keep the rice,beans,vegetables,fruits,nuts/seeds, and other plant based foods in your diet. By doing this you will reduce the amount of fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and the amount of calories you eat because plant based food are less calorically dense than animal products in general. If you try this diet just make sure to eat enough calories for your body type. Hope this helps you with your weight loss journey. :)
It's not really about what you eat, it's more about portion size and equal balance or proteins carbs and so on. You can lower your calorie intake by a few hundred. So say from 2000 a day to maybe 1700 a day. Do at least a 20 Mon work out a day. Instead of cutting bread you could switch to brown, whole grain and so on, as for price use brown rice and brown pasta.
It can if you have a propensity to gain weight from wheat. But use rice noodles and cut out all white and wheat flour products.. Add exercise and make sure your plate is filled 2/3 with fruits and/or vegetables. If you can further eliminate or vastly reduce white and brown sugar you will lose weight. But this has to be something you intend to do for a lifetime. You can't just diet until you lose weight otherwise it will all come back.
The two things you picked are among the worst foods someone on a diet could eat. Rice is almost 100% starch. Your body is very efficient at converting starch to sugar. It is the worst of grains to eat when you want to loose weight. Noodles are refined grain powder (flour) formed into strings and flat shapes. It is also almost 100% starch. If you are going to eat any form of grain on a diet, make it a whole grain so the fiber will move the grain through and out of your body before all of the starch can be converted to sugar.
Bread converts to sugar just as quickly as ICECREAM. It's thick and heavy; of course you'll get muffin top. If you eat small portions of bread it won't do much harm:) hey if you want to lose weight; exercise can help a lot
cutting meat out of my diet helped me lose weight even though I eat lots of bread
Noodles -_- Losing weight is by cutting in-took calories, and maxmising the calorie-burn by exercising. So, cutting some food won't simply lessen your weight.
Yes, but you should not eliminate that much bread. It's unhealthy. We need grains for energy, and eating carbohydrates, contrary to popular belief, does not make you fat. Eating too many will, carbs themselves are not the problem.
Get "hooked on ebonics" to balance it out.
I think the version you got was hooked on CHRONIC instead of what you mentioned
lmao

Ignore these narrow minded scoffers. If you do have the gift, the best thing for you to do is seek out a mentor to help you develop it. These people can be difficult to find (for obvious reasons). A good place to start is your local esoteric book store or a place that sells crystals. DON'T search on line.
no joke, see a psychiatrist or at least an MD of some sort. If you literally see auras, something is terribly wrong, possibly a brain tumor, possibly schizophrenia, possibly something else. Get treated.
Make an appointment with a psychiatrist. They will tell you all about it.

Yes. I'm sure some people do hate sunny weather. However, I am not one of them. I hate hot weather but I like plentiful sunshine. I don't like overcast skies and all the rain and gloom. Some people like violent thunderstorms. I don't. I'm worried the power will go out or a tree will be blown over or struck by lightning and hit the house. I like seeing all the pretty girls that seem to only come out when the sun is shining.
Oh yes - this is often true of depressed people. Sunny weather is just unpleasant for depressed people perhaps because it puts too many demands on you to Get Out There - and Be Happy! So this is a good question to ask your patient - whether they prefer SUNNY days or cloudy days.
You could move to Alaska or Mongolia where it's cold and dreary most of the time. I get frostbite just thinking about it.
sometimes the sun can get in my eyes you can try sunglasses if it bothers you, to be honest i hate having snow to trip over, Id rather have summer
I like both winter and summer
If you lose weight you lose a little all over even your toes.. You can exercise the one area to tighten it up and maybe lose some fat there.
you can not spot reduce fat, unfortunately when you lose fat you lose it all over.
liposuction
maybe
Contact Stanley Steamer carpet cleaners. Only $99/room. Find a better dr.; there are good meds for anxiety and panic.---------- Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Definitely go to a new doctor. You'd probably benefit from anxiety/depression medication, at least until you get things under control. Just remember to have compassion for yourself, not to push yourself too hard, and to remember what your needs are. If you can afford it, counselling would probably help a lot with your mother's death. Good luck.
There's treatments for that you know.
Teens have fluctuating hormones and roller coaster emotions. It will level out as you age and mature.

Do not go on a 500 calorie diet. If you do u will be extremely weak. 500 calories is only about half of your daily calories needed to function healthfully. If you want to lose weight work for it. Not eating isn't going to make you skinny it's going to make you unhealthy ....
Why on earth would you wanbt to diet? You can check every chart on line and see yo are already LOW weight. Presumably you are also intelligent enough to realise that starvation diets are unhealthy? Get some help. You will lose rapidly on a diet like that at first but immediately put it all back again when you eat normally. You will also stop losing quite quickly as your body tries to save itself from damage and death.
Exercise is good. Eating healthily is also good. At your height and present weigt, losing weight is NOT good. Check with your doctor. He or she will tell you that , if anything, you may be underweight. At least you would be considered to be a normal weight. Even if you were overweight, which you are NOT, losing pounds that quickly is unhealthy. Start with your doctor, keep eating healthy foods and exercising, but forget about losing weight, you will make yourself sick and unattractive , if you do lose .You will be losing more than weight.Good wishes,
Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing. I can feel the difference since I've started, and I'm loving my results so far. My energy is through the roof, making my workouts more fun and productive. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to increase their energy and better workouts .
Too much. You need to get some help. That is not healthy thinking.
You weren't really specific about the size of it but it sounds like a swollen lymph node. I had one once and it can be caused by many things. I had a UTI that I never got antibiotics for so that why my had swelled up. A swollen lymph node means an infection in the body. If you choose not to go to the dr and get antibiotics it would stay there for awhile and scar your skin as it did mine. Not anything serious just go to the dr and ask for antibiotics
Assuming you mean pubic hair (if you have hair in your vagina there is something VERY seriously wrong ...) it sounds like an infected hair follicle. Keep it clean and don't mess with it. It should clear up on its own. If you're worried or the problem recurs, see your doctor.
Lice
A Boil. Apply hot compresses to it, and slather it with neosporin.
Infected hair duh
He probably won't need to look at your bum or your lady parts; he won't need to. If, when your mother made the appointment, she told the doctor's office that she thinks you have worms, you will be asked to bring a stool specimen with you, and he will examine that in order to determine what type of worms you have.
Hi... well the best thing you can do is to remember that doctors see people's bums every day. It's part of their job, and it's routine to them. Really, the doctor is there to help, not judge. Doctors also do pelvic exams on lady patients all of the time and they see "lady parts" every day too. Again it's part of their job.... Best wishes!!
It's possible he can diagnose you based on your symptoms only. But, if he decides to examen you, remember he sees peoples' bums ALL OF THE TIME. Also, it's the profession he has chosen, so you need not apologize. And your mom can be there the whole time if you wish.
Relax. I had the same issue, and have had numerous "A** problems" Since I was 10. Talk about Embarrassing. It really Isn't. They give you a robe to wear, and they ALSO give you a sheet to cover yourself with, exposing on a tiny portion of what they are looking at (TINY Portion) you are not going to just like their spread eagle and say WEE LOOK AT ME!" It will take literally seconds of your time and then you can go home.
Remind yourself that if you don't go see someone it will most likely worsen and worsen, you're doing the right thing
I doubt if he will look, there is not much to see.
If you don't propagate and take some remedial steps, depression may aggravate and spoil your physical fitness and mental health conditions to a great extent. You will be bad, sad or mad soon. You should therefore share it with your parents or your mentor or your family doctor.
Just ask some one for an emotional support. For example just share it your Mom or to your best friend
Tell your parents. They will be upset that you feel this way BUT they would be more upset to find out later and didn't feel you could tell them.

My girlfriend wants to have sex with me and I'm only 16 and she's 16 but it's to small I need to know if there's anyway I can make it bigger it's like 2-3 inches when it's hard and I already know it's to small to do anything so if there like any thing I can take or do that will work I would like to know thanks
LOL... you are a really lame troll. No 16 year old boy has a penis the size of a 11 year old.
you wait about 10-15 years and maybe you can do this http://www.foxnews.com/health/2016/05/16...
There is nothing
I suffer from reoccurring tonsil stones and I saw another one in my right tonsil. I started poking at it with the back of my toothbrush and my hand slipped and I heard a loud crunch. I looked at my tonsil and it was just blood everywhere. I cleaned it up and got all the blood out, the hole poked all the way through my tonsil. This happened 2 hours ago.
If I were you I would head to the emergency room as you have just put yourself at risk for serious infection and possible excessive bleeding. That hole in your tonsils has to be looked at by a doctor and I wouldn't wait too long because the mouth is full of nasty, harmful germs that can infiltrate your bloodstream. Asking on the internet is not going to solve this...you need immediate antibiotic treatment and possibly stitches.
Make an appointment to see your doctor ASAP. If it's not bleeding anymore, it's probably not life-threatening. But, you do need to have that looked at as soon as possible, preferably by an ENT. You might need antibiotics. In future, try to remove then with a cotton swab only. I wish you well.
See a doctor.
go to the hospital.
you might be but it's a very high possibility that it's just you growing up. from now until you're like 21ish you're going to have some weird emotional stuff. the only thing that strikes me as odd is your thoughts of hurting your family. that's not normal. everything else is, to a point.
Absolutely not Bipolar Disorder. Bipolar is when a person has periods of mania and periods of depression. Mania must last a minimum of a week and depression 2 weeks. In reality they each last for weeks or months or even years before cycling. Rapid emotional changes are perfectly normal for a teenager...
Nope, sounds like hormonal fluctuations due to the beginnings of puberty, we all go through that. Being bipolar involves more than just mood swings, way more.
If your mood swings are to the point where you are suicidal, that is serious. Even if they are "normal" adolescent mood swings, you need to get help. And no, you are probably not bipolar. Bipolar episodes are measured in months and years, not minutes or hours or weeks.
Yes, you're bipolar. This cannot be treated at home. You need to see a medical doctor.
There is a range of problems which could cause the symptoms you report and only a proper diagnosis by a doctor can determine for sure what is causing them and what the proper treatment is. However, you cannot cure any problems of the penis by showering with cold water. An oily waste substance called smegma, along with stale urine, constantly collects under the foreskin. These need to be washed away at least daily with warm water and soap (note that water alone will not remove the oily smegma). The soap should be rinsed off well afterwards before drying yourself.
Neither do we. However might be Jock Itch, which is a fungal infection. Chat to Pharmacist and see if he has a treatment. Don't be shy = it's very common. < M
Get yourself to the SDC clinic ( that's sexual disease ) & get checked out , persons who come on here , including myself , can only generalise ,you need professional advice . good luck .
parasities or bacterial infection. see a doctor asap...
I think it's a legitimate request and many patients would feel okay with it. You don't, and that's ok, too. She was just asking to see how extreme it is, as that might help her assess how big of a problem it is. I think you can continue with her comfortably.
It is completely normal for her to ask that question. Granted you don't have to do it, but The fact that you keep cutting yourself she wanted to see how much damage you are really doing.
Some guys are born naturally with large erections, and porn producers look for well hung guys to star in their videos. While less then 5% of all men are 7 inches or more, most porn features guys in that range because people want to see big ones. Some really big ones are the product of penis pump misuse, and they don't get very erect and can't do a lot with their oversized gear.
That's due to genetics. Some have it and some don't. There is NO surgery that will enlarge a male's natural attribute.
Whilst some porn stars have naturally larger than average penises, it is very easy these days to digitally enhance the apparent penis size on film. This is only one of the many digital tricks used to make porn films more 'appealing'.
Most pornstars as far as I know are born with big penis or grow one naturally in puberty = and simply say porn would fun and send their erect photo to model Agency. Surgery simply does not work yet. < M
Well first of all these "porn star" guys didn't have surgery or do anything to get bigger. They were naturally large which is why they were chosen for porn.
1 cinema effect make it bigger then real 2 they choose just the big ones that's easy... no need of any surgery
Did all basket-ballers had surgery to increase height?
There are many men in the world have very large penises. Just like there are many men in the world who have very tiny penises. The rest of us or somewhere in the middle of that. Think about how silly your question is Kid.
they are born that way
They use extensions.
I was recently measuring my penis. I read that the proper way to do it was to stretch the flaccid penis as far as it could go to get an accurate measurement. When I stretched it while flaccid, I feel like I may have pulled it a little bit too far. There was some slight pain. I don't feel much pain now, and I don't see any bruising. I also don't believe there are any broken blood vessels, however there are some protruding veins. Should I seek a medical professional or am I okay? Are there any dangers from stretching the flaccid penis too much?
Slight pain just was telling to to quit pulling your pud that way dude. And you measure properly when erect, not flaccid. Get really erect then lay a ruler along the top of the penis facing you, and push the end back against your pubic bone. Read the measurement on the tip- do it several times over a week and of course take the largest measure (can vary as much as half an inch or more each erection) as your size. You'll heal down there, just made it sore.
I don't know where you read that, but that's a bunch of bullshit. You're supposed to measure your penis when you have an erection...not while flaccid. You should be fine but if you experience any prolonged pain or swelling you should see a doctor. I would think one would be smart enough not to attempt that in the first place.
To correctly measure a penis it should be erect hard. And pulling your flaccid penis as far as it go wont give you accurate measurement and may cause injury. Protruding veins are normal and its clearly visible when erect since veins and your penis is flooded with blood... Stretching flaccid penis too much may cause some bruises or redness, and its uncomfortable.
1) you need to just go. You'll appreciate it if you do, and it may also begin a regular routine. 2) you could get a workout buddy who's motivated to go, because they'll give you junk if you wus out from going.
I'm the same exact way, but I got a Fitbit to motivate me to take more steps. So I run up and down the stairs and as I watch tv I listen to music and do some simple exercises. Even your phone can track steps.
1.have a reminder on your phone that lets you exersize once a day at the same time 2.put a picture of a model ( skinny) that will make you want to have their body 3. reward yourself with something each time you make an effort to exersize 4. write down each time you eat junk food during the week. At the end of the week, count the total and each item of junk food would be 30 minutes of exersize
Stub your toe on a brick. That will motivate you like none other!
Sounds a bit weird but yes, it is healthy. Good mix of healthy fats and protein.
That`s an extremely high fat, high carb breakfast.
That is way too much sugar in your diet
What the fck.. It's food just eat it
It is not an entrance exam to Harvard. You are not being graded on it for crying out loud. If you can't see it, just say so. Sheesh... what is so hard about that?
Guess correctly ? At the DMV - you get a drivers license At they eye doctor - you get the WRONG prescription for eyeglasses
You can say, "It looks like an E but, honestly, I'm just guessing. It's rather fuzzy."
You're not supposed to guess. If you are not sure say so.
Silly idea. If you are not sure, say so, If the letters look blurry, say so. If they look clear, say so.
i'm a man in my late 30s, i live alone in a council flat....i have no support network, except for my dear mum.....i am also a sufferer of borderline personality disorder and ptsd? i was once a young youthful guy, handsome and attractive.......now im an overweight, prematurely aged 38 year old.....im also bald. i have never had a girlfriend. i sit in my lonely dark flat and mope around, because i find humanity hard to deal with outside? i feel like im getting on in years now...and it would be too late to try and change my life, even if i wanted too? times have changed, things are not like they used to be.
No. Being in your late 30's is not old. 80 is pretty old. You have a long way to go to make it to 80. It is too late to go back and change things. You need to stop wishing you could do that. The past is over. Just focus on the present and the immediate future. Maybe turn some lights on in your flat and invite somebody over for a cup of tea. The worst they can say is no. Actually, that's not true. The worst they can do is laugh in your face. But that's okay. You don't want someone like that over for tea on second thought anyway.
I have BPD and PTSD amongst other mental health issues, am also of a similar age to you and also find dealing with humanity difficult. It is NOT to late to change your life. You can have an amazing life - just gotta go for what you want and find a passion. I am only just about to finish a degree that has taken me 5 years due to my mental health and that's ok!! I might even do more study and travel and have babies etc etc.... you can too!!! X
You have possibly lived only one third of your life.Plenty of time for change.Some women find baldness VERY ATTRACTIVE.You did not say if you work.Go to your local library,look on notice boards in shops,people advertise for help on them.Even just go for a walk.Say hello to people you pass.Comment about someones dog as they walk past you.Once you get started you won`t be able to stop.
You are only making yourself old by refusing to not leave your apartment and enjoy life. No it is NOT too late to change your life. Please seek help from a therapist and move on with the life you are missing.
It is never too late to try and change your life around
Yes drinking will make it all seem a lot better.
no, i dont think its ever too late to change your life, you just have to figure out how to do it
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Works great for oily skin in cold and dry winter, very long-lasting moisturizing. Doesn't cause breakouts. Satisfied with this purchase . A bottle of argan life Ultra Nourishing Argan Oil can last REALLY REALLY long
don't scratch it off it'll scar
I took St. John's Wort years ago when I was a teen and it was like really brand-new... but I didn't notice an difference. Oddly enough now they've almost made it a prescription-only since I guess it interacts with stuff.
Save your money.....they don't work! Every vitamin and supplement has the warning right on the label..."Not intended to treat or cure any disease." Get wise to yourself and save your money.....make an appointment and see your own family doctor for an evaluation, a diagnosis and treatment.
Never made a dent in my depression. Prescription psych meds are the way to go.
Yes. My uncle has taken it.
They don't work.
First of all, you NEED to eat breakfast. It kick starts your metabolism. Prep healthy meals for your lunch and dinner like chicken, turkey, fish, eggs (no yolk), brown rice, veggies, green leafy veggies. Get creative and look up recipes using these ingredients. Buy fresh veggies. And if you REALLY want to lose weight, hit some cardio.
Eat smaller and more nutritious portions. Eat whatever you want but in small portions and add exercise
Here a full diet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPRxNm5Cf-o
Drink as much water as you can
.
Wear pouch style briefs, low rise, no fly that will hold your gear in place better and also actually enhance your bulge a bit. Also no one can judge penis size when a guy is flaccid.
Surely a bulge looks like you have a BIG penis. Why worry. < M
Get bigger shorts / Jock Strap
No one's looking at your crotch smart one. No one cares.
get a bigger pair of shorts
I'm pretty sure she doesn't need tampons anymore. And I'm also pretty sure you've never been intimate with a woman in your life.
Sure, she can leave it next to mine..... though you show yourself pretty ignorant of women in general if you think she is still menstruating. But that's typical of men these days.... still think you can make laws regulating our uterus' even though you have no idea how they work...
I wouldn't let her in my house, let alone use my toilet
How would I know she was going to do that? All she asked was to take a shower with me...
She is past that time of her life so no
Yes. No offense but I have my own problems that I don't share with anyone. Nobody wants to hear about my BooBoos.
It depends. If someone asks me if they can talk about something, and talk about their negative experiences, or how their feeling. Then, I don't mind. However, if someone is ALWAYS being negative, and complaining all the time, it may get a bit uncomfortable. I try to be accepting and open minded, but too much negativity from a person can start to affect me as well xx
not really as a depressed person myself i can understand. i personally never talk about my feelings to anyone and appear to be happy all the time, but this makes me feel incredibly lonely and makes depression worse. so i think its great that depressed people are able to communicate how they feel, it helps!! if they say it so many times a day, then it can get kind of annoying... but i'd try to think positively about it. most depressed people feel ashamed to though because of the stigma, but this isn't fair either. please continue to express your feelings freely, you have the right to! <3
I love hearing about other's problems. It probably comes from me wanting to express my feelings openly but never being able to. I love it when somebody will open up to me or listen to how I feel. I also love food. Probably why most of my relationships don't work out.
at the sex toy shop or ask santa
On the internet, or in an adult store.
You dirty little ******
I feel as though I'm ready, I know I know the law states 16 in England but alot of the things we do is illegal anyway. I plan to loose it this Saturday (not sure if it will happen) I just wanted to know if anal, vaginal, oral or fingering my girlfriend is best for first time? (Will use protection for all but oral and fingering) Please help and no hate :)
Use protection for oral though because those nasty ****. Don't do anal I'd just finger. Fr though you're 14 just wait a little longer but if you're that desperate hit it with the finger
You feel as if you are ready. So you admit you do not know. Take a step back - Would you want your grand son or grad daughter taking this action knowing they are not ready even though they feel they are ready? You are not now that grand father. But you will be one day. Take your time. Be really ready. Make it more likely you will still be with Grandma when you are that Grandpa. Because your path now takes it very unlikely you will still be with Grandma when you are Grandpa.
It not just if your ready, it's if she is ready too. Don't force her to do anything, and do feel forced to do anything if you are not comfortable either. Since your only 14 just stick to fingering cos its STD and pregnancy free.
Give the kid a break we can't avoid what he does. But honestly wait some time dude seriously your 14. But if you vaginal is the best. Anal? blah few girls would want to do that the first time if ever. Fingering is your best choice though STD and pregnancy free.
I couldn't even pay attention to anything but the fact that you said *vaginity*
Because you think that someone who was abused as a child will walk around always in tears? Or just with our head down in shame? Or pissed off and screaming at people all the time? How is it exactly that you think abused women should behave in order for you to even believe that something happened.
just because she looks happy with life doesn't mean she really is. she might just be good at hiding. that's how she's been raised? i was sexually abused and was taught to "keep it a secret". i never tell my friends anything and they're all convinced im happy :) but they'd be surprised to know what i've been through.
I dunno. Like the race card, the sexually abused card also gets tossed around a lot. Makes you wonder if most rape stories are actually true or not.
You're an asshole
dont know
OK
Sure you can, just be careful since porn is addicting.. As long as it doesnt interrupt your social life and behavior. And be careful not to get caught watching it while youre still 14.
Sure. Go for it. ----- ----- ----- It is natural, normal and even if you have a sexual partner, is sometimes biologically unavoidable. Some people assume that things that are private are somehow bad. (There are still a few religions that disapprove of it.) You may as well get used to it because the urge will be with you for the rest of your life, although it can weaken with age.
Sure, or just use your imagination and go solo without porn. Average teen does it at least daily.
Completely normal. Masturbation has no ill-effects and a variety of health benefits.
That's normal, no worries.
yes, that is normal, but as long as it does not control you. Porn is addicting and must not be the center of your life.
That is not too unusual for a guy your age.
once a day will not mess up your life
porn will make real sex tougher to do
just once? not bad
you probably got crabs..
See, you have done a mistake and now you are suffering from it. Now get tested and then forget about what has happened, learn from the mistake and don't do it again, because you have to suffer like now again (Not even with a condom). Have one trusted partner for sex even it may take time to find a one
You probably contracted Hong Kong Dong. Get it checked ASAP.
better check a doctor, parasites or such
Electric toothbrush. You can even get an attachment for it .
How about a vibrating pet pooch tongue
An electric toothbrush.
electric toothbrush. if you live with your mom find hers and use it
no not really without getting effective prescription medicine. try to stay hydrated and maybe try a salt watergargle. this kills bacteria in the mouth
Theres a chance you will get it and nothing you can do now. It sucks but if you do get it than just go to your doctor and they will prescribe you antibiotics. Just stay hydrated right now and dont kiss that person again. Hopefully you didn't make out for a while.
Strep throat sucks!! I've had it since Monday its Friday now mine was accompanied by a horrible fever my strep throat is down now my fever is on off (horrible) no over the counter meds helped me for shiii just wait it out, it sucks ik
Not really. If you got it you got it, and you'll know in another day or two. Sucks to be you. Good luck!
You could take antibiotics now, but there's no need. If you get sick, see your doctor for the antibiotics.
Eek doubt it
I am a seventeen years old girl (almost eighteen now) and I was in a position a few months back when I could not leave the home because of my depression and anxiety. I seeked help and now I am alright. You will be too.
yup twice In my life. once when I was in elementary. that day I didn't even know I took a shet while barfing and ended up walking around school with a shet stain. the other time was about 2-3 years ago had a stomach flu or something just threw my boxers and shorts away and took a shower right after
Yes and some of the vomit came out of my nose.
Yes. I had the stomach bug about a month ago. Had my sister taking the pîss out of me too and recording me laughing :-(
Yes , after we all went strawberry picking , We ate more than we paid for, I wanted to die I felt so ill .:)
Do you have your own bedroom where you can be naked at night and freely masturbate when all the family are asleep? or maybe you share with a sibling brother and It's akward -hence the bathroom is good. When I was 15 I used to masturbate in the woods just pick a spot that's really quiet and secluded, later at 23 I had sex in the open same woods with an older female I was seeing while walking our dogs as finding somewhere private was award as I was still living at home and she was married.
Just keep in mind that getting caught masturbating in a public spot, such as these trails you speak of, would be far more embarrassing then being caught at home. You may also be subject to a criminal penalty.
dont you have a bedroom or ever home alone
It's called relative sizing. If you down a band, you have to go up a cup; if you go down a cup, you have to go up a band size. Because the cup size is based on band size (fullest part of bust measurement-underbust measurement), a 34B and a 32C - and, for that matter, a 36A or 30D - hold the same volume in their cups. It may be a brand difference (Glamorise is the worst offender), or it may be that you were measured wrong and need a different size altogether.
Measure just under your arm pits around The circumference. This gives you true bra size
Well I am 34b and I'm 23, your still growing don't worry you'll have bigger boobs than me by time your my age lol
they are bug
Have you been eating beetroot/drinking beetroot juice? That'll turn your pee red (and is completely harmless and nothing to bother about). Otherwise, see a doctor
Beets, blackberries, rhubarb, some medications ( Rifampin, Pyridium, Azulfidine and some laxatives containing senna) and of course blood. If you haven't eaten or taken the above products, it may be blood. Call you MD and get checked for a UTI.
RED PEE CAN SOMETIMES BE A GOOD THING!!! oTHER TIMES RED PEE CAN MEAN REALLY REALLY BAD THINGS. nOW I REMEMBER GROWING UP AS A YOUNG BLACK GIRL IN THE INNER CITY... TIMES WHERE TUFF...BUT AT LEAST I WAS SKINNY BACK THEN. tHEN OUT OF KNOW WHERE, MY FRIEND I INVITED TO CHUCKY CHEESE ACTUALLY SHOWED UP, (OMG) He looks totally fat! ...HAS JUST NOW POINTED OUT THAT I AM NEITHER BLACK OR A GIRL. I WAS LIKE WHAT'S YOUR POINT? MY GOD! WHAT A TOTAL IDIOT!
See a doctor
My pee is red on my period you should state ur gender
No idea. Such secrets are only known to the subjective mind of the individual. There is no chance for others to know unless the author reveals it. Who knows. God alone knows everything. Did you take lot of Beet Root yesterday.
It could be blood but urine can also have a red appearance if your not drinking enough water. Also, some vitamins can give your urine a reddish orange color. Good Luck!
Internal bleeding
Are you drinking enough water? Usually if you are not drinking enough water, your urine will be red and health problems can follow, and if you are drinking enough water, you might have to see a doctor about it
with your kinnd permission- additional questions are to beasked in real life... would you please be so kind and see your Family Doctor there-in real life... eating beets may turn the urine red...right... but it's very hards to tell ''by phone''' what is it about... tthe responsible and healthy way is to seek medical advise and torough evaluation in real life...with no neglecting...
Hi everyone today I wanted to know if I m normal or crazy. So basically I talk to myself and if I watch a TV show I will pretend I m in it and and things like that. I also pretend that I have a different life like I m famous or something. I have this whole different life in my head and I will like talk to people (famous people usually) in my different life and I sometimr of I m doing a normal task I will pretend it s or a to show or something. Anyway I just wanted to know if this was normal or I have mental disorder or something but anyway thanks.
Normal
Do you pretend you have a different life to escape your current life? It's okay if you're doing it for fun but if you're doing it to escape something then that's not normal and you're coping for what you don't want to see in reality.
Sounds like you just have an active imagination, there's nothing wrong with that as long as it's not interfering with your life.
You just like to fantasize; that's all. You're crazy if you think it is real. And you're antisocial if you do that around other people.
your in deja vu it think its perfectly normal like its not bad or anything I do it myself sometimes.
I think it is cool
Dear Lord...
That is the bestiality if it is even true. He's not who you want to ever sleep with trust me. You were not his first partner like animals have herpes.
seriously? how would happen? and if he really HAS herpes and you have had unprotected sex, the YOU have herpes too. he probably got it from a hooker
Wow he's a crazy lier
He probably didn't wear a condom
No way! hes mistaken
Most guys ejaculate soon after beginning puberty and starting masturbation. Just takes the right "stroke" to get there. Next time you do solo sex, try this-- when you are ready to "finish" use your groin muscles to tighten up your scrotum repeatedly, like you are trying to pull them upward. This should tighten your ball sack really tight at the base of your shaft, and often this action will jump start the male climax- an all over tingling sensation, followed almost immediately by the ejaculation. Give it a try.
Yes, it is your age. At 13, you will get your spermarche anyday.
You will make it when your body is ready to do so. As is you get all the feelings with none of the mess to clean up.
It's a 'work in progress'... give it a bit more time.
I will echo not to try to lose more than 2 pounds a week but specifically you shouldn't be trying to lose more than 1% of your body weight a week. Having a balanced diet (don't deprive or restrict - just eat the things you enjoy - just less of it.) and staying active should help. I will say though that if you are under 18 it isn't advisable to be on a diet as you are still developing/growing.
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product product is really a flagship for weight loss. There are not side effects and its really easy to take. I ended up losing 10 pounds in 2 weeks. which is pretty significant. I would recommend this product ot really anybody who wants to lose weight or wants to curb their appetite. The hardest part of this is to remember to take it at least 30 minutes before you eat .
yes, if you keep up your diet, and go to the gym regularly you can lose up to 2 pounds a week, but don't try to lose more than that because that can be bad on your body
losing 20-25 libs should be very reasonable
I do feel as if Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea works for the long term. I started using it about a month ago. I stopped using it for a couple of weeks due to an illness I got, and did not gain back even 1 pound of weight. I have now begun use again, and it’s working great. I am pleased with it, and even more pleased by the fact that it doesn't give me any negative side effects.

The average penis size for a 14 year old is 4 inches.
Aragorn did not answer your question. The average erect penis size for a 14 year old is around 4 inches.
Since that's at an age where some guys have barely hit puberty and others have been in it for 4 or more years, the range could be from prepubescent child size (barely 2 or 3 inches) up to full adult size (average 5.1"). Anywhere in between would be "normal".
Most guys reach full adult size by 14-15. Average adult size is 5.16 inches.
for 14 yr old should be about 1 inch
6 inches for a white man and 7 inches for a black man
4.3" - 4.5" or thereabouts.
Nope. Foreskin is sealed in childhood. Usually the seal dissolves about puberty, by itself. Very few boys can retract at 8, unless been abused by doctors. If it doesn't retract don't force it. It may retract flaccid before you can do it erect. Masturbating with baby oil MAY help it retract eventually and also helps prevent getting stuck. You don't need to clean under there until it moves. And smegma is protective anyway. A lot of Answers on here do not have a foreskin. LOL. You can have sex without retracting. < M
Don't try and retract it- foreskin matures really slowly so won't mature until 15-17 and then should come back easily.
This thing works well. I am very satisfied for what its has done to my body. i dont know why some people who tried this male enhancement of huntington labs did not get the result they i get from it. Maybe because they might be doing it wrong. Henceforth all of the negativity about this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product, i have tried and and saw results. Great!
An orgy is a group of people having sex together. The word you're looking for is orgasm. And yes... gyrating while thrusting may help a bring a woman to orgasm more than just thrusting alone would, but she may just get there that way too.
rotating the hips during intercourse is kinda like stirring a spoon in a cup.. The vagina has a plethora of nerves very close the entrance, which are connected to the clitoris , so the added pressure from the inserted penis vis the hip movement does enhance the feeling of pleasure . which when added to all the other sexual sensations will bring an orgasm
Might make your penis hurt like heck by "popping' it. Stick with the normal thrusting up and down motion and use your hands or mouth for stimulation of the female's clitoris- that will get her to orgasm better than anything.
If your vagina smells fishy it could be a sign of infection. Make sure you are cleaning your vagina properly and showering regularly.
"you are what you eat" says it all. body odors can come a lot from your diet.

Depression can present itself in many ways, you may feel apathetic all the time, sad all the time, hyper/hyposomnia, more irratible, not enjoy things you used to enjoy, suicidal thoughts, doing poorly in school, etc. I would recommend seeing a counselor if you feel like you may be depressed, as even if you don't end up actually having depression it's good to talk about whats bothering you with someone.
Smoke the Mary
Visit the counsellor
Hot or not, Cheetos are processed and contains artificial preservatives and food coloring which has been known to contribute to an increased risk of certain cancers over time. That applies to all junk food, not just Cheetos.
Highly processed food can be a risk in certain types of cancer, but spicy food may provide some protection from other types. If you have an otherwise healthy diet, it will probably make no difference one way or the other. If you have a bad diet, you have an increased risk of a number of diseases.
The worst risk from eating hot Cheetos is that they will stain your fingertips orange until you wash your hands. Be careful not to wipe your fingertips against your shirt, if you are wearing a white shirt.
No, they can not cause cancer. Calm down.
No, but they can cause obesity, which increases your risk of cancer.
Stop being stupid.

everyone's recommending kegels, and i'd like to point out that kegels do not make your vagina tighter. vaginas are not supposed to be tight. if someone recommends a "vagina tightening" treatment, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction. however, i do think you should do kegels (that's when you flex the same muscle you use to cut off urine). building up that muscle can really help with bladder control and a lot of other issues when you get old
Don't make your vagina tighter, there is no need. All vagina's come in different sizes, as that what makes us unique. No vagina is right or wrong, don't be embarrassed if it is loose neither. If you strongly dislike it, then exercise would tighten the vagina. Let us know what works out for you.
why would you care about the state of MY vagina? There is nothing to make it tighter, nor would I want to.
Pelvic floor exercise Kegels
Its better to have a large vagina so i can accomodate guys of all sizes. When i was tight it took forever to reach full penetration.
Like anything else you want to tighten up, you need to exercise. There are actual vagina excersizes, the most famous being Kegel exercises.
Loose already sucks to be you. There's nothing you can do but working out helps

(^ IGNORE)i am 13 years of age and during puberty i started developing these white bumps around the rim of the head of my penis,i've never had sex before and the first time i ever masturbated and ejaculated was a long time after these bumps first appeared around the rim of the head of my penis,is that normal? and i am certain they are not Fordyce spots,i am 100% sure of that because that appears around the mouth/on the lip and all the way down the shaft,i am worried and need serious answers.
There is nothing to worry about. What your describing sounds like PPP or pearly penile papulas which are normal and are a skin type not a condition or disease. Some guys have them some don't but they are very common.
Don't be to worried. It probably just a reaction from masterbating for the first time. If it doesn't go away in a few days try using some cream on it and just leave it be like don't masterbate for a few days if you can.
Probably Fordyce Spots.
What's a "bumb"?
You need to speak with your dentist. Personally, I think you should get the teeth that are none functional removed and keep the good ones. If you can afford an operation, I suggest you getting teeth implants. It is worth every dollar!
Look up how to regenerate teeth! You can do this with eggshells and comfrey root! Also with cod liver oil, my brother did this and healed his teeth! Also look up oil pulling!
u can do it urself, u just need some tweezers and then u go pluck pluck pluck and there, no teeth, also helpful cuz then ya dont have to waste time brushing, i found this to be one of the best decisions i ever made
I don't understand what you are asking
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
I went to a co ed school, I feel its better for both gils and boys. Sending her to a single sex school will not teach her how to interact with boys, and may even cause her to become a lesbian
It is better to do what is right for the individual. Generally, single-sex establishments are not good at preparing for life after school.
It is up to you. You know her best. My niece goes to an all girls school and she loves it.
it's better to send her to where it makes her happy
So I have a birthday party to go to in about an hour and my period is late and I'm afraid it might come today... I have some tampons just in case but I know you can't put them in if your not on your period. Also it's a public pool. What would you do if you were me? I just hope it doesn't come today. Thanks!
Go ahead and put a light-absorbency tampon in. You normally shouldn't use them on any regular basis unless you are on your period. But this once it's fine. I'm over 40, have done it occasionally, and never had a problem. Just remember to remove it when you get home.
Put a tampon in your purse or in the bag you carry your bathing suit in, and take it to the pool with you in case you need it.
I would wear a pad, go swimming, get out and change. (Been swimming with pads on my period for 35 years, no trouble here.)
I'd go to the pool and check for my period every time I go to the toilet.
than just go swimming and you'll be fine
Don't go in the pool.
Under normal circumstances your spine will not affect blood flow to any part of your body. A severe injury could conceivably affect the blood flow to a specific area of your body at the site of the injury. A spinal injury can cause muscle spasms and pain. Lifting incorrectly can cause a herniated disc. (crushed disc, slipped disc) If you are still in your teens a herniated disc is extremely unlikely. You would be more likely to pull a muscle in your back.
Unlikely your spine being messed up would affect blood flow except perhaps in the area where the spinal issue is located.
oh and my muscles are getting stronger than before imo it did for me :) but my size is also affected by sports and maybe working out. so maybe i have blood flow issues. maybe this will help someone else who had similar problems get their penis more normal
Yes it can cause different types of problems. But it has no effect on penis size.
I would go with the coffee in the morning. That is partly because I can't imagine starting a working day without a coffee. Yes, too much caffeine is bad, but one cup in the morning is no big deal, and will help you be alert for the day. Two in a day is acceptable, three is too much. Hot cocoa is going to have at least as much sugar content, probably more. If a coffee with cream and sugar puts you in the right state of mind, then it's definitely worth it, because you do everything better when you're in the right state of mind.
I would go with the coffee, since caffeine in moderation has many health benefits. I would try to eliminate the cream and sugar if possible, and get all my morning calories from healthy food.
Coffee with vanilla flavored sweetened almond milk.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
If a single depression episode lasts for more than a month, you may have clinical depression and will need to see a mental health professional for a diagnosis and a solid treatment plan. You shouldn't have to suffer needlessly.
Talk to someone you don't know as a best friend, but still know as a friend. When you talk about what's happening, more than often you will be able to figure out why you are depressed, and you'll have a special relationship with someone that you will be able to trust. If that does not work, then tell your parents.
i think you have depression, sounds like me, you have to find a psychiatrist or therapist to help you they will show you what to do all that fresh air / exercies stuff is bullshit if you have actuual deppression it wont help. but its worth a try i guess. just find someone to talk to who knows what to do
Drink pineapple juice and plenty of water. Always have water at hand & drink everytime you feel like coughing or feel throat's itchiness or dryness... Problem is you'll just have to often go to the restroom. Sometimes, I also drink mucolytic medicine like carbocisteine to soften or liquify the phlegm that's causing the sore throat (that is if cold is the cause of your sore throat). Enough rest or sleep is also needed.
Hi. I get sore throats all the time so I'm in your boat! There's no cure but you can reduce the symptoms. I generall have hot tea with honey because the honey soothes the throat. I also only drink hot water and remember to drink lots of water because otherwise it'll get dry! Other than that I also use heat rubs and apply to the throat and chest, especially during sleep. I find that it helps with sleep and feels soothing. Good luck with your recovery!
Cut a lemon into a few pieces and squeeze the juice out of it into a cup. Drink it! This is usually what I do when I have a sore throat. I don't know if this is the "proper" thing to do, but it helped me from my own experience.
drink lots of liquid and loads of sleep
You are indeed over weight DONT FREAK OUT not by much I am over average at 130 pounds at 5-4 but it all depends on age, gender, height for your height yes you are but how old are you and are u female or male male is higher than female but I'm sure your fine how you are no matter what :)
Yes. You are overweight.

It's 280 calories for the whole sandwich. Good for you.
A sandwich's composition can vary greatly, but it is never calories. It HAS calories, but it isn't a calorie or calories.
that sounds low to me, I would look up the calories of the individual ingredients and weight them on my food scale. 8" Tortilla = 120 calories 1 slice of cheese = 113 calories 5 ounces of chicken = 231 calories I think it would be closer to 500 calories like in mcdonalds but depends on portions/weights
it means one whole sandwich is that amount
Not unless the care label says so. Most cushions are either feather or sponge foam neither of which react very well to being machine washed
It can make it all soggy... look on the label or where you got it from. Personally I wouldn't and just get a spray and wash it :)
I don't know?
not a good idea.

Stop.
God, you're transparent. Just like your "oops" with being suicidal, your self-harm is all about garnering attention and getting your parents to fly into a panic over you. If you want your parents to pay attention to you, offer to spend some time with them. They're not noticing the raw, unfathomable depths of your twisted psyche because they have they have real adult sh*t to do, like putting a roof over your head and food on the table.
Sit down in a neutral place with your parents and tell them.. If they get upset, it's not because you have done anything wrong, it's because as parents we have a natural instinct to protect our children from harm..
well- it sounds to me you're young enough to be my son- to begin with... and it sounds to me you deffinitely - maybe urgently need the professional help of a psychologist or psychiatrist thereof -in real life-in your area- someone skilled in treating people of your age... and the more inasmuch as you're suicidal- then- no further delay in your getting professional help is warranted... I humbly think both your parents-inasmuch as possible- and- also - such responsible adult as your Family Doctor there has to immediately be fully aware of what you're going through... ask for and timely get the help you need...
If they are f@cked up parents, they will get mad. Any normal parent would try to understand why their child is suicidal and doing self-harm and try to fix that via talking and verbal and emotional engagement. If they get mad, they are seriously f@cked up souless people.
Don't tell them. You will only end up going into counselling and that will lead to more cuts and you being suicidal. Counselling doesn't help, it really doesn't. I wish you the best of luck. Stay strong :)
Believe me, they will only want to help you.
I have actually been burned badly TWICE in two different industrial accidents. It is much worse than we can imagine. While in the special Burn Unit of the hospital, even after they inject you with Morphine, which is the strongest pain-killer available, the "debridement" procedures will cause anyone to cry out in pain. That is when they scrap the dead skin away in order to avoid infection and prep for skin grafting. I have endured a lot of injuries and pain in my life. Kidney stones are no fun either. But the burn treatments and the actual burning pains were the worst! There were times when death seemed like a plausible option.
Being burnt is one of the most painful things to endure. If a person dies from smoke inhalation first it is a blessing.
I was in a car accident last year the car was engulfed in flames and I couldn't get out and whenever I did get out I had 3rd degree burns all over my body. It was excruciating pain. I was in so much pain I was begging the nurses and doctors to just let me die.
It's kinda like when you're watching a show and realize it is just part one of a two part program and the second part isn't coming on for a week and you have to be at work then. It's horrible like that
Horrible is my guess. Hopefully they go into shock. I've had 2 bad burns in my life. Very painful.
It's like getting nailed up to a post except more burny and less posty
I saw a TV show (so it may not be very accurate) that a person is in agony for a little while, but once the nerves burn the pain ends.
Really bad for a short period of time if done correctly. If the fire creeps up on you it is probably the worst.
It's nothing compared to burning in hell forever and ever
Its pure torture. I feel so sorry for the people who have suffered . Its one of the most painful ways to die
In the Great Vagina Disappearance of '76, vaginas were gone for 144 days. As I recall, we did not stack them, stone them or hunt them. We DID have every scientist on Earth trying to figure out WHY women's vaginas will occasionally disappear, en masse. Scientists have wondered this for ages. Seems that about every couple of centuries the coochie just vanishes. Nobody has explained it. Lots of theories. No actual scientific proof yet.
Neither. If women didn't have a va-na-nah the human race would not exist.
Muslims remove their clitoris and stone them to death. Are you a Muslim?
? get help.
how so?

Classic case of hemmeroids. No you don't have cancer. You can treat it by sitting in a moderately hot sitz bath or tub of hot water.
As i stated in my last question I was considering wearing diapers, and today made the argument stronger, as I wet myself twice today and didn't wear a diaper. It was pretty humiliating, but I'm also not sure that wearing adult diapers wouldn't be more humiliating. If I were to start wearing diapers how do I hide the fact that I'm wearing them because when I put one on under my clothes tonight I did notice but maybe I'm just being paranoid. So the question really is, how do I hide adult diapers and do you think it would be less humiliating then wetting my pants?
You have other alternatives. There are pads designed for people who are incontinent (men's pads are shaped differently than women's pads) and there are also a number of medications available that may take care of the problem. See your doctor first before resigning yourself to wearing adult diapers.

As we age, typically EVERYTHING gets worse, including vision. It does not mean you will be blind though. The body simply wears out.
No. A lot of people will need cataract surgery though and everyone, well, most people will become far-sighted losing their short vision.
No But most of us need glasses at some point.

Yes. Masturbation doesn't end one's virginity. You would actually have to have sex with a partner in order to lose your virginity.
Yes of course.

Ask a licensed homeopath. I've seen some over the counter stuff at health food stores, but never tried it.
Homeopathy has no more effect than placebo. Actually there's a joke here. I heard homeopathic medicines contain no efficacious ingredients and I was like 0mg.
It's not medicine. Homeopathy is a sham. Fake. does nothing.it's useless beyond placebo.
Any homeopathic medication should be fine as it is all the same. Nothing.
possibly Bioplasma.....it will supply 12basic cell salts and will not harm you either
I have heard that ginkgo is good.
Depends on size
69 kg lol Also this is in the wrong category.

as heavy as your dreams
well it all depends on how big they are
Idk, depends on the cup size
Who are 'they'? You and your scars will fit right in here in 'Merica. No one is going to arrest you for having control issues. If you try to bring a blade on the plane to cut while flying, THEN you may be arrested.
We don't know who "they" are but rest assured that no one looks at, or wants to start changing your clothes or accessories! Scars and arrests? You've got a overly active imagination!
They won't arrest you because you have scars. I don't think they would ask you to remove the sweat band but if they did, they would let you put it back on afterwards.
That's not their business. Sweetie.
Maybe its okay this time coz you havent caught. Hes a guy, and you know why we have sword, you shouldnt do it again... But of course your a girl and a teen what do you expect in you? Scared, sad? Of course not. Just control yourself

Sure. Everyone enters puberty and grows and develops in their own time and way. You will continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties.
Small. Maybe not for long? healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...

Ummm ...might be. Depends on where you are in puberty. < M
Yes. If Hillary takes the nomination I will support her and so will Bernie.... to do otherwise would be equivalent to giving a vote to Trump. And while Bernie is my first choice I still choose Hillary over Donald. If your Ice Cream parlor is out of your favorite flavor do you stomp out in a rage or do you say "Aww shucks" and go with second best? Are Cruz backers going to sit home with their bibles on election night? I'm actually hoping that that the GOP refuses to give Trump the nomination and he starts a third party... They can call themselves the TTT.... the Truly Tanned Titans! They'll go much farther than the Tea Party ever did.
The establishment has already picked her. The only let Bernie run so it wouldn't look like a coronation but it has blown up in their face. The Sanders supporters should protest about the way he is being screwed and boycott Hillary.
I remember the controversy and predictions, in 2008, that Hillary supporters were so upset by the way that the DNC had treated her that her supporters would rather support McCain than Obama. It didn't happen. Hillary's supporters calmed down and supported Obama. Sanders' supporters would most certainly not want to see Trump as president.
Most of the Sanders supporters I've spoken to have said one of the following: 1. Not voting if no Sanders 2. Not Hillary! 3. Not Trump! 4. Independent voting.
Yes, of course. Bernie is so far from Trump that Hillary won't even seem like a lesser of two evils for Bernie supporters; she'll just be the only candidate. The ballot will be like a "multiple choice" with only one reasonable answer. ex: What is food? A) Food B) Not Food C) Also Not Food They'll vote for Clinton.
They won't forget. They'll just vote for her anyway because they realize she is better than the alternative. It's pretty much the same thinking Cruz supporters will do when they support Trump.
I personally know dozens of Bernie supporters. Not a single one says they will support Hillary if she wins the party nomination.
Nope
Sometimes voting is a process of picking the lesser of two weasels.
Actually I am thinking about Jill Stein!
All the new hormones and introduction to newly discovered ideas (like sex) can result in adults thinking they are idiotic and immature.

I've looked into it and researched it quite a bit, I need about 1500 calories a day and would 3 tv dinners (each about 500) be good for me each day? I know it's not "clean eating" like fruits, veggies, but it's still calories in vs. out, I would of course try to squeeze in an apple or something if my calories don't reach, and for additional vitamins.
I really like this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product because it actually works..which is rare! I have already lost 2 pounds, and it has only been a week! I will continue using this supplement until the bottle runs out, and I plan on purchasing another bottle or two to keep me on track.
Not really. You will look and feel fatter on them, due to their large amounts of sodium, and you will most likely get a headache every day. Go for the fruit and vegetables and add your own protein
TV dinners full of sodium. Sodium makes it hard to lose weight.
Don't eat tvs
Way too much sodium.
if u wanna lose weight then just use the military diet
1. Ask when she had her last full physical check up. 2. Ask what symptoms she is having that makes her think it is diabetes. 3. Ask if her insurance requires a referral for a specialist. Basically, when someone thinks they might have diabetes, an endocrinologist is NOT the first place to go. It is best to start with your regular family physician. They can do a full physical and determine if there is a reason to go to an endocrinologist.
Ask what her insurance allows. Some plans require a referral for a specialist. So she may have to see an internist for a diagnosis before she sees an endo. Not a bad idea anyway.
Her primary care doctor. Her insurance MAY require a referral to specialists, and most specialists require a referral whether insurance require it or not. Plus the copay is also more for specialists the primary care, so it is best to start there. Also as it is just suspected why see a specialist without need. Specialists also have longer wait times to be seen for new patients.
Not being a doctor myself, I'd just advise her to go to her own doctor and consult with him. Initially, she doesn't need a specialist, just needs her regular doctor to run a diabetes test. Not all diabetics need a specialist initially. I've been diabetic for over 5 years but manage to keep my glucose levels pretty low so I've never seen a specialist, my primary care doctor does everything.
Her won GP can arrange for blood tests and she wil be advised to get it done on a fasting diet
I would ask if she needs a referral to see a specialist, or if her health insurance would accept any appointment she felt she needed.
Ask her about her symptoms and then ask if she has a primary care provider. They can do the general checks for this (blood and urine) and then refer her if necessary.
Because women are the ones that carry babies. When we women settle down with a guy, and decide to get pregnant, periods will tell us if we are pregnant or not. That's why God chose us to get periods.

There are different causes of CHF. The treatments and outcomes depend on the cause. You need to find out from your doc what is causing the heart failure. Some conditions that cause CHF are completely reversible; some can be treated to prevent things from getting worse; and some can only be managed to slow the progression, but will eventually get worse no matter what. .
Can't be cured, only managed. Medications are required - heart medications as well as diuretics (to remove fluid). They should also be on a strict fluid restriction, around 1.5L a day (depending on how bad they are). And obviously try to stay as healthy as possible with diet and exercise.
BUT you have not to cure yourself treatment depends on increase force of contraction by plant called digitalis only plant that found to increase force of contraction and two or more drugs diuretics to increase water excretion here is your body with normal volume of blood normal water distribution on body and strong heart but you should have choose the right doctor
Can't be cured. Medication to help treat it, but weight is a huge issue, as well as water.
Can u tell me your symptoms
this is what you have to ask your librarian
Um push yourself down the stairs then land on your knee. Hit your knee repeatedly on a wall. Use a hammer too, hit it hard. Btw, make sure you have money or your parents have money to pay for your hospital bills.
Hammer. Pipe Wrench. Kitchen Knife. Basically, find any heavy or sharp object and whack away... Though you probably should find a phone and get some help for your self-harm issues instead.
First, make sure your parents have insurance to pay for the medical bills resulting from your stupidity.
Depends do you want to never walk agai pr just miss a ttest...
Curiosity killed the cat, and satisfaction brought it back. I expect it'll happen soon for you. Try to relax a lil bit and breathe into it more. Also, if you layoff it for a few days, that will help it to build up and you may then find the next loooooooooooooong, slow session brings you the results you seek.
Should be able to easily by now, so just not getting past the "hump" to release. Next time when you think you are "close" use your groin muscles and repeatedly tighten or lift your balls to make your scrotum tight as a rock at the base of your shaft. Doing that can often push you past the point of no return and give you your climax and ejaculation. Good luck.
Well your body just isn't ready to make it yet. In time it will. At the moment you get all the great feelings without the mess to clean up. You will soon be ejaculating.

I ve been dating my GF for almost a year, and a few months ago she told me she was dealing with depression, and that she cut herself. She s cut herself more than once these past few months and everytime it brought me to tears. I tried really hard not to, but I can t bare to see her hurt herself. She went to her school doctor and the prescribed her pills and counselling, but after a few weeks she s refusing to do both. I don t know what do anymore. I feel like anything I say is a slippery slope, and don t know how she ll react. I m really scared for her. Please help me.
I have went through the same thing with my girlfriend, she told me she had cut herself because of all the things she was going through at that time. She's stopped doing it now. The best advice I could give you is too just be with her as much as you can, right now you are most likely the best thing in her life right now. I know it's hard to see someone like this by experience but just be there for her and after a while she may not do those things because she knows that you love her.
Call a cutting/self-harm hotline when you won't be interrupted. You can find their phone numbers online. Even though you are not the one cutting, they may be able to help you come up with ways to best help her. They're the experts.
Girls and guys swallow semen all the time. No reason it would be harmful unless you had a transmittable disease,and if you did, you should not be sticking your gear in someone else- any orifice.
Yes, it is perfectly fine to swallow semen.
Seminal fluid when ejaculated into a mouth is quickly neutralised by saliva and stomach acid, there is no danger to your girl friend or you.
I do it all the time. Totally safe. Sometimes I give a little back.
You should not have sex if you don't know... If you are healthy it's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/***-swa...
My ex-girlfriend did it all the time and than she would get mad.
its wrong not to swallow
it is ok, full of proteins.
He's not worried about some other student getting a medicine they shouldn't have - kids of any age can buy OTC medicines. He's worried about getting sued. If I were your folks, I would call him on that.... More to the point, I would have your folks have a lawyer call him on that....
The biggest concern is the *potential* for the person you are trying to help having an adverse reaction to the OTC drug. There is a big legal difference between them purchasing the drug(s) for themselves (where THEY assume liability) and you offering it to them (now YOU are liable). For that reason, many companies that thought nothing of stocking their first aid kits with commonly available aspirin, antihistamine, and headache tablets removed them for fear of being sued by someone who might end up having an allergic reaction.

I would say if you really want to gain weight then eat before bed because if you do that the food stays in your body and your still so you don't work it off and it becomes fat. Eat a big meal everyday like a big dinner. Try having seconds. Hope this helps
are you trying to lose weight or gain it?? drink milk, peanut butter is good, not too many carbs, vegetables and fruit, and I;m pretty sure that'll help you out
Nuts or peanut butter are healthy and high calorie. Ice cream is good for people who have problems with their appetite. High protein foods will probably help too.
start eating more food, but keep it healthy and exercise, you'll slowly gain muscle mass and fat thus gain weight.
Is he actually faking it or does he really believe that he's having a heart attack? You should talk to him and maybe go with him to his GP or Cardiologist and see if he needs to see someone else to discuss WHY it's happening. Anyone with any kind of trauma can have PTSD, and yes, that can include heart attack survivors. PTSD symptoms aren't always the same for everyone. But if you notice any change in his behavior, he should probably see a therapist (or at least his GP; some GPs do basic evals before sending someone to the therapist).
He is suffering anxiety and a form of PTSD. I am surprised this is not evident to you. When you go from being a healthy person one day to having a life threatening medical episode the next, this can happen...obviously. He's not 'faking it'...he is feeling every pain and convincing himself he's about to die...he is quite genuinely short of breath, having palpitations and pain, sweating....but it's adrenaline and fear. It is treatable but will need medication and counselling.
No, stay away from Chiropractors, especially those who advertise that their spinal manipulations can be used to treat non-muscular skeletal conditions. They have been taught subjects that lack empirical evidence, objective data and cogent reasoning. Your dad needs to discuss this with the specialist or the Dr.
You should discuss these concerns with his doctor. Maybe he can benefit from some counseling, or maybe it is musculoskeletal pain he is experiencing, in which case a physical therapist can help him.
Depression, anxiety are actually very common after a severe heart attack. idk why doctors don't talk about this with their patients but they don't. Google heart attack victims and anxiety.
If I was you, I'd rather work with seniors. Mentally disabled adults can become (depending on where you work, of course) extremely violent. I had a week internship at a hospital, and in the span of that time- a woman was sexually assaulted, someone threw a chair at another patient, we had to put a guy out forcibly who was having a violent fit, a guy peed all over in the rec room, and there was a guy who kept masturbating in front of the young women. I never went back.
You'll get out of it what you put in regardless of who you decide to work with. If you're taking the job on the basis of which is easier, you're in the wrong line of work. It's like the people who want to become teachers because they get to take the summer off. Wrong reasons.
You have to decide that for yourself, nobody can tell you that. If you aren't mature enough to decide then you have a problem
both are admirable
Tabacco industry is an extremely profitable business and easily taxiable, I live in MN and guess who paid for the new million dollar dome? Smokers through taxes on their cigs,cigars, swisher sweets, and etc. Also as you know cigarettes are extremely addicting, many if it were to become illegal would just buy from illegal sources. It would be like the prohibition all over again. Not to mention how much prison space it would take up having cigarette "dealers" and people caught with cigarettes put away.
There are lots of things that cause cancer that are not illegal. People still have a choice. Bad ones maybe. They should be made illegal, but they wont because the industry generates billions. They have a lot of power with lawmakers through contributions so no lawmaker will cut off their $$$ by outlawing the industry.
The same reason that alcohol is legal...it's big business. Cigarette taxes are huge and excessive, the government wants that money. They may as well legalize prostitution and marijuana, regulate them, and tax them as well, since they've lost the war on both it seems
Freedom of choice. Fattening foods kill people too. Diabetes is at an all time high yet desserts are still legal. If a person wants to smoke, that's their choice. I'm not a smoker so just don't do it around me or my kids.
And what about the Monosodium Glutamate contained in so many food products on the supermarket shelves? The BPA in the linings of canned foods? The preservatives used in Deli Meats? Capitalism is good, but it has no conscience. We live in a society where profits come before people.
there are millions of tobacco addicts and the tobacco industry makes a lot of money We learned a valuable lesson with Prohibition. Making cigarettes illegal would only increase crime
Because the cigarette companies want money

As far as I know it wont affect a female diabetic but male diabetics can suffer with erection problems - only problem will be in the future if you plan to marry her and have kids because during pregancy there can be complications to her and baby, Good Luck
Pretty much like everyone else. You get excited, you have sex, you lie there blissfully happy and wonder why it took you so long to try it. You want to do it again. Etc. Just if you try marathon sex, you probably should test your blood to make sure you aren't using up too much glucose so you won't go into a low. If you are just starting out, maybe just make sure your tests are pretty close to what they've always been and any wild fluctuations you should talk to your doctor about--your sex hormones will be going upa nd down a lot which may mess around with your insulin.
I'm dating a girl who is suffering from diabetes. And I love her so much. But I have had heard that with diabetic woman sex issues arise. Is it right?
Diabetics have it almost like paying a prostitute. Diabetics should have health insurance that covers prescription drugs, as they will eventually need Viagra which costs 1 cent per tablet to make, but they're sold for $40 each.
In males, erectile dysfunction ... the inability to obtain, or maintain an erection long enough to have sex. In females, lack of vaginal lubrication (dryness), loss of sensations, MAY have trouble achieving orgasm, lack of sexual desire (this MAY be related to the lack of comfort due to dryness). Take a look at the following webpage to find out more of what 'problems' can occur.
think about it - and even type 2 can affect it
Weight doesn't just mean fat, it can be muscle and water as well. If you'd like to know, get your body fat percentage measured. Online BMI calculators are vague and inaccurate because they do not take muscle mass into account.
Nah, you're fine, thats a good weight for your height, some of those sites are totally fake, Ask your doctor
was that the BMI you calculated? that number is unreliable. it tells me i'm underweight but if i gained weight, i would look chubby. ...i would just look in the mirror and be honest. also, how do you feel, do you feel overweight? if you have no fat, you're not. muscle is heavier than fat as well, so yes, that could be it.

Nothing will happen; not unless you slaughtered the pig yourself that the raw sausage came from. In that case, the raw sausage might, just MIGHT, contain the E Coli bacteria. If you bought the raw sausage in the supermarket, then you have nothing to worry about.
You'll get a case of the dreaded sausage eye
You will turn into a sausage
You may not get E Coli bacteria, but, it may get infected. You have to watch out for pink/red eye and discharges which denote infection.
The sausages will be even more delicious!
nothing will happen
You will go blind.
Not anymore. But, when I was a kid, I would down two bowls in the morning, two bowls at lunch, and one after supper. I'm not kidding. That was my diet during high school for the most part. Usually it was Alphabits that tempted me, but there were other romances, like with Captain Crunch, Fruit Loops, Raisin Bran, Frosted Mini Wheats, etc. Yep I was loose and got intimate with many :)
I have eaten cereal for breakfast, lunch and dinner before, as well as at other times of day. Not all in the same day, that would be too much cereal
I eat it whenever I'm hungry and there isn't anything to eat at the moment lol which is usually around night time..I hardly even eat breakfast.
yep

Just say, "Dad, the athletic cup I bought isn't the right size. It's uncomfortable and doesn't fit right so I need to get a different size."
Mom, this athletic cup is really too small. May I get another one? Now, wasn't that easy?
Just be frank with your dad and tell him you are too big for the cup they bought so you need to get a bigger one. He can take you to get a bigger one.

Ovarian cysts are very common. Most require no treatment. Some require monitoring. Few reqire hormonal treatment. Even fewer require surgical intervention. Ovarian cysts and ovarian cancer are different and if cancer was suspected you would be having a biopsy. Leukemia and cervical cancer are unrelated to ovarian cancer.
The words "cyst" and "multiple" virtually rule out cancer. Cysts are almost never cancerous and the odds of cancer starting out in two locations at the same time is close to zero. It appears that you probably have PCOS - make an appointment with you local doctor to explain the ultrasound findings and to find out what needs to be done for the cysts. A lot of times, the problem is cleared up with birth control pills.
If you had cancerous ovarian cysts you would of been told. If you are worried you should make an appointment with the doctor and ask them any questions that you may have
You don't have ovarian cancer
You need to relax
They are probably benign, which is common.
The amount of scar tissue in your foot will increase and you will lose some of your mobility. The pain will stay the same, but your foot won't heal without stretching it.
The inflammation will increase and the pain will, too. Eventually, quickly, you'll stop being able to walk without SEVERE pain.
your best bet is to find out the underlying cause, lack of essential fatty acids, or d3 or whatever...could be a mineral shortage, either way, an ama type doctor knows not the cause......good luck trying to figure it out
it will only get worse
I don't experience any pain only when I'm sitting or lying down. When I get up, about a minute later, I feel terrible pain on top of my head, also on the back of it. And when I sit down, headache is gone. What is causing the problem? Is it something serious? I took one pill of ibuprofen, and it didn't help. I also drank one liter of pure water because I thought that it might be slight dehydration. It didn't help either. What is it? I'm a little worried... Please help. (Sorry for bad english, it's my second launguage ;) )
I would direct this question directly to a professional to get the legit answer.
Blood pressure is way off I'd say.
It could be a trapped nerve in your neck causing the pain when you move
I have this problem mainly in the mornings or if I haven't eaten that much. I don't know how it happens or what is happening in the body because I am not a scientist. But as far as I am concerned if I smoke too quickly (like I do in the mornings sometimes), it makes me the same. Or if I have just woken up, or if I am going on a fast. Maybe you're doing something different when you do it? Does it happen every time you smoke? Maybe it's your bodies way to say stop smoking!
Stop smoking
Why should you care, if you already KNOW they are bad for you ?? The smoke is replacing the oxygen in your lungs & your blood-oxygen level is getting too low. No big deal...

I'm an overweight person, and I typically refer to myself as fat because it's easier to comprehend (overweight can refer to anything out of normal range, whereas fat is different from chubby) but still people try to use it as a term to insult others? I don't understand why it is offensive, even if spoken from my mouth. When I say things like "I'm fat" people tell me not to say it, but I'm just using a self descriptor! Isn't banning the word fat creating more harm by enforcing stigma than good?
No. There are nice ways to describe yourself and not nice ways to describe yourself. "Fat" is a very vulgar term.
Yeah speed walking is a good exercise to begin with. In fact you don't need to run at all if you don't want to. Speed walking can provide the same benefits as running as long as you do it for a little longer. It is also infinitely easier on the joints.
Speed walking will reduce your risk of cardiovascular diseases, and will hep you to battle obesity. Its a good way to start as you will build a routine over a period of time which is very important if you want to start exercise. Also you can do some pushups and squat after walking for a few kms. The most important thing that you must remember before starting to do exercise that its not a one day process and its takes of time, effort, and discipline. Stay fit and healthy.
speed walking doesn't work you have to run and get heart racing just start off doing 10-15min of jogging one than the next day do 20-min Etc
yes it's great and will tone your butt and legs. What I did is i downloaded this app calling running for weight loss (the icon is like a red fire flame or something) and it has different walking/running training programs. its free and has helped me go from absolutely despising walking/running to actually enjoying and looking forward to it.
Though you may think you're ready to go, you aren't yet. He's got more work to do down there. Try having him penetrate you with fingers first. It'll gently stretch the opening and get you even more ready for action.
I'm not large (quite small to be honest), but I think Sara is right, have him give you plenty of oral sex as part of foreplay.
He may be too large. You should try lube.
Genital warts
If she has an std in her mouth then you could get it but your chances are low. If it's only on her genitals then you're not going to get an std from just making out with her.
Back in my teen days when you made out with someone it meant intercourse so if you done that then yes you will probably catch std, if you only mean kissing and touching then you are ok.
Depends on the STD and what "made out with" entails.
Sometimes, depends on the STD. You have to do more research for this one.
If you unsure just pop it up her ârse
Everyone has a six pack but most people have layers of fat covering it which is why some can suck in their stomach and you can see it. So yes. You have to get rid of the fat. Running daily will help as well as some cross fit. Anything getting you constantly moving.
Your body fat needs to be below 10%

yes and It is an excellent source of protein. I eat eggs 3 times a week, and 2 of them are not boiled. I eat scrambled, and I eat over easy, done in a pan sprayed with Pam.
Seeing the natural ingredients and that it was caffeine free I got a bad figuring why not. I am not to much overweight and a big tea drinker so I could easily slip it in my normal routine. I was impressed over the increased bowel movements it gave me. I also enjoyed the taste promoting me to keep drinking it simply because I liked the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . Then after a week I noticed weight starting to drop off. I guess all those masses clogging my intestines are finally out of my system. Feels good to be clean inside.
Yup it sure is. It is an excellent source of protein. I eat eggs 3 times a week, and 2 of them are not boiled. I eat scrambled, and I eat over easy, done in a pan sprayed with Pam.
Absolutely. Eggs are packed with protein which can stave off hunger later in the day which is why they're good for breakfast. Anything with tons of fiber does the same. Dairy products like yogurt and cottage cheese has stuff called creatine in them, which works similarly to protein and feeds you slowly throughout the day, also staving off hunger until it's time to actually eat.
Absolutely! I eat 2-3 eggs per day with butter. I have lost weight and kept it off. (I do not count calories- it is stressful!) Eggs are extremely healthy for you. They are better in so many ways than cereal and toast.
The protein molecules change when cooked. Raw eggs are the best form just don't crack the shell on the same glass you drink from. Egg whites only if you wanna cut fat out
Who cares? Not you! If you are dieting, then you obviously don't care about your health.
I don't see why not. As long as your not eating the eggs raw you should be fine
yes
Give yourself a logical reason to be proud of yourself! Hurry, stop whining and get to work NOW. Slow progress is better than no progress. Negativity is all in your head. You can get through it with willpower.

Careful what you listen to = the age you SUPPOSED to retract is the age it is possible to retract = which may be 20+ in some guys. It is sealed in childhood. Usually it retracts in puberty but may be tight when growing. You do not need help, just listen to your body. < M
You heard wrong. the average age for the foreskin to be mature and easy to retract is actually 15-17. Don't get in a hurry, let your gear mature properly.
Merlin is an idiot. You should be pulling your foreskin back everyday and washing under there. Something you should have been doing for many years now. Funny how the rest of us can do that, but Merlin can't.
Sometimes it is because they might have loose skin after losing a lot of weight, which can make them look older - contributes to wrinkles.
I tend to gain weight and heard about this product so I bought the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product . It’s only been a bit over a month now and not only I didn’t gain but I lost about 7 pounds. I also feel healthier a day that I’m taking this .
Because a lot follow fad diets to lose weight and put there body under a lot of stress when doing it therefor and up looking older in the end . also those who are naturally bigger look older because they need that weight
I blame it on the type of diet they did personally. If they did it too drastically, whether it was cutting way down on calories or carbohydrates & not enough water; I think these kinds of regimes' make people look the worst. I seen people who followed 'slimming world' type diets & Dr. Phil's' ones looked the best in my opinion.
Because her face got narrower so now it has loose, baggy skin. In a little while her skin will shrink so it won't be wrinkly anymore.
There's less fat in the face keeping the skin taut - So when the fat is lost, the skin becomes looser and makes someone look slightly older.
It's natural. So don't be upset.
Sagging skin where fat used to be.
Average.
No, my brother is 14 and he's about your height. I'd say it's normal
Yes, definitely. It would be considered tall for an adult.

IF YOU ARE REALLY AVUTELY CHRONICALL ILL I GIVE YOU 3 YRS AT BEST. BUT I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR MEDICAL Records. Ask your Dr. Get affairs in order.
Only a Doctor can give you that answer. Good luck.
well if you quit now you could live to be 100
i would be scary knowing how long you have left so i ask you this do you really want to know?
it depends on how it happens. if it was particularly violent, it is definitely possible that you have broken bones. you should really see a doctor
sure if they beat you up and break your bones...... you can also get broken bones without being raped
since you may be beat up in the process, or thrown down on cement I suppose you could, it is not the most common injury
It only depends on how rough the predator handles you.
sadly yes you can
yes if it was violent
The best age to go to the gym is 14 .
13
You don't really need to go to a gym until you're in your mid-teens (15, 16), but even then you need to spend some time getting help to learn good form before going nuts with heavy weights. If you're young and want to exercise, the best way to do it is just to go out and explore and use your body weight to develop muscle. Climbing stuff is a great way to develop functional strength.
i start when i was 16 years old
any age from 3 to adult i assume
18....

Tons of bumslps in between my eyebrows, and my upper forehead

Nope, I never had it. Thank God.
Are you trying to say that you feel like you are ejaculating, only no semen comes out of your penis? If so what you're describing sounds like retrograde ejaculation. That's where the semen instead of coming out of the penis actually goes back up the urethra and into your bladder. Where it is later flushed out when you urinate. Is this what you are describing?
Keep trying, sounds like you are stopping stimulation and not hitting a full climax, which would force the semen out.
Dont stop your climax, when you reach the point of no return then surely you will ejaculate, keep trying.
The words with asterisks are semen
depends on genetics. if the females in your family seem to gain weight in their backsides, there's a pretty good chance you would too. if that's the case, then try gaining weight. it might go to the right places. if not, then exercises! learn good form for squats to build muscle in your glutes and do them with weights if possible and/or step up and down on a chair/bed 100x each leg 4x a week.
That is all about genetics... I am thin myself but I have a big butt (my measurements are 31-24-36.5", but thats just because I gain weight in my butt.. you could try gaining weight
Squats. Start doing at least 45 squats a day, everyday.
Mmm. Yeah. You in trouble now. This is what happened to the last person who ever got even a microscopically small speck of urinal water in their mouth:
Doctor advised to drink urine water in many cases. So don'T worry.
No. Urine is sterile. In fact, you can drink it in an emergency, although I can't imagine that it tastes good.
No you can't.
what was you mouth doing that close to a urinal?
Same thing happened to this guy. Developed terrible underbite.
Highly unlikely, at best.
Disgusting, what were you doing so low?
Lol
no you can't
No your head doesn't 'fall off', but it can be seriously affected as well as the rest of oyur body
Yes, and you will shoot your decapitated head with your dads pistol because you're high and nothing can hurt you.
Might as well. Seems like you aren't using it anyway.
yes
yeses
Sleeping lots and mood swings are a result of the hormonal changes in your body that happen when you are a teen. Still it does seem you are anxious about a number of things that you could not possibly control. That would leave anyone feeling helpless. Helpless does feel alone and scary. If you think it's getting too much of you please visit your Dr. Ask about speaking with a therapist. That being said teenage girls and crying is far from unheard of. You will know yourself if it is out of balance. If so you need to go through your Dr.
depresion while it is common doesnt make it some blow off able thing! aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
The world's longest recorded penis is 13.5 inches and belongs to Jonah Falcon.
No one knows that information but only about 10% are 6.5 inches or more. Even though 90% of all teens claim to sport 7 inches or even 8.

It is a bit late telling you now, but a womens bicycle seat is a different shape to a guys. As for the brusing, it will be ok in a few days
It's almost certainly just minor and will heal in a few days. I'd never thought about this, but apparently men's and women's bicycle seats are meant to be different. They probably put you in men's bikes. Here is an article I found about women's bicycle seats: https://totalwomenscycling.com/road-cycl...
You hurt your genital area, not your vagina (an internal organ of the genitals for sex, birth and menstruation). Learn some basic anatomy and the correct terminology. As "Paula" said, the ache will go away in a few days.
Urologists.
I assure you, this is it. It works just as well if not better. Also, I had no side effects as I did with the products that didn't even work very well. You can buy this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme with confidence.
Works very well!! No side effects , such as headaches other users complain about. Would recommend and have reordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product again.
ProlargentSize gives you less energy, but keeps you hard. I have been looking for a product like this that wont get me all zooped up and ProlargentSize has a good balance that gives just enough energy and raises your sexual stamina.
Yes.
I bet there are have you looked around? Maybe even your physician can help you out
It would be a Urologist.
Yeah i guess. Its a part of being a teen. When i was 15, i was in a puberty that the urge to have sex was really strong. so i did fvck my buddy, not so intense just ******* and bj and a little bb but we do it in curiosity just to know what it really feels like.
Actually more than ever will admit it. Maybe not at 13--14 but by 20 a majority of males have had some type of same sex experience- mostly jerking together but many do go further.
Yes, other guys do it it's just experimenting, something very common with guys your age
Yes. < M
You need to give more description. Just because it says you are hyper doesn't mean you are going to be bouncing off the walls all day if you have it. I have it and I'm usually energetic, but I tend to stay laid-back at times. Main symptoms of the disorder are trouble paying attention/sitting still, tendency to start something and not be willing to finish it, urge to constantly move on to doing something else even when you've just started, etc. See a neurologist. Good luck I have ADHD too -G
Cause "everyone" knows so much. Is even one of those Everyones a doctor? I'm guessing no. So you can ignore them. Turns out everyone don't know shyte.
Because your young and have alot of energy, if how you are is fine with you, don't change stay the way you are. They want you on medicine just to shut you down.
maybe because of electrolyte in cheese which gives energy. source : google 'cheese electrolyte' and vaccenic acid in dairy fat, ruminant fat which cause bipolar. dairy fat, beef fat aka vaccenic acid cause bipolar disorder source : 'Vaccenic acid is also found in human orbitofrontal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.[10][11]' in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccenic_ac... from 'vaccenic acid' in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat from google 'trans fat'
Your mannerisms or demeanor I guess. A dr. is the only one who can diagnose and treat you.
You need to be diagnosed by a doctor/specialist
You deal by making good sound plans for leaving the second you turn 18. Most either join the military or leave for university.
Well, you can take the GED test and if you pass you can get your high school diploma. Then you can get out.
No way
Yes, you can conceive. The commonly used lubes aren't particularly friendly to sperm, but there are brands of intimate lubricant which are designed for people trying to conceive. There are no known long term problems associated with the use of lubricants, either.
There's no proof or evidence that using lubrication causes infertility. You can use it with no worries.
If *you* hit someone? I'm pretty sure they wouldn't even feel it.
try it on yourself to find out
Not as much as my bowie knife.
yes it would
Ummm ... I don't know. It's the transition from masturbation to sex that is the problem. At 21 you are a bit late. Does not sound like you have damaged any nerves, so shouldn't worry about it. Depends what technique you use. I don't think the problem would be staying up (beyond the usual first time problems most guys have) it is more to do with using the pressure nerves to ejaculate. Some women not very skilled at using vaginal muscles to squeeze, so you might not have enough pressure. < M
If you have no erectile dysfunction you are probably fine. But should be able to masturbate in any position. Turn over on your back and get personally acquainted with your gear, dude. Can't see it perform when going prone.
Prone is not a good way to get your rocks off
See a doctor and have your ears checked. There is an infection of the inner ear that is known as Labyrinthitis and that is often the underlying cause of vertigo. It will not cause you to have an ear ache, and you will probably not be aware you have it. Labyrinthitis affects the little "hair-like" follicles deep inside your ear that control your equilibrium. A couple of weeks of antibiotics will cure it. I had Labyrinthitis and some days I felt so dizzy that I staggered when I got up quickly. A couple of days after beginning antibiotics, it was like the difference between night and day in the way I felt.
Vertigo comes and goes, I just take medication for a few days then stop when the dizzy spells are over.
Dramamine
i take Dramamine but i take the less drowsy can the regular one stop the vertigo
Talk to your doctor about a medication called antivert.
You arent fully stimulated i suspected. Masturbation make you feel good about yourself, the longer you masterbate the higher the chance you will ejaculate... Doing it while watching porn will surely make you cvm but just be careful since porn is addictive, its a fake sensation you really wanted but in reality it isnt.
Just have not found the right "stroke" or stimulation to reach climax and ejaculate but certainly should be able to at your age. Just need to focus more on your body when masturbating, avoid porn when doing the deed and see what happens.
I don't think you are that far into puberty yet. Might want to wait a little bit.
I didn't start masturbating till 14, or ejaculating.
ask a doctor as thats your best bet for the best response .
nothing, you likely need a female to complete the deal for you....not everybody can just jerk and ***
Masturbating, thats what is wrong with you
you may not be that far into puberty or you are masturebating to much
You are on empty.
If you cannot work full time work part time or get a casual job. I was working part time when diagnosed, continued working part time throughout treatment and switched to full time 6 months after completing treatment. 10 years later I returned to part time work as a lifestyle choice.
Many businesses are constantly looking for part time help. So start looking around for help wanted signs in your area. Usually part time employment is much easier to find than full time employment.
Try part time first. That's what I'm doing.
try working part time
part-time? work from home?
Ask where you were treated.
We both recently had appointments with our respective doctors and they both told us that we need to lose weight. However, my doctor said that I was "morbidly obese" and made a much bigger deal of my lack of exercise. Do the doctors just think large women are less healthy or am I really bigger than my bf? Me: http://imgur.com/XmD18k5 Him: http://imgur.com/knI2HsM I always thought we were in the same weight range (fat but not "morbidly obese"). Am I wrong? Please be honest!
Yes, you're more overweight than him. It's the leading cause of heart disease, diabetes, and a whole myriad of other issues. You can look up a BMI chart. You don't need to eyeball it in a picture.
I'm sure doctors aren't sexist like that. They make a big deal about someone being morbidly obese regardless of their gender

8 many glasses of water a day should you drink.
8 is advised although there are some food and drink that you have everyday that contain water, meaning that that is decreased. I personally only drink about 4 pints of water a day and i am guessing that the other 4 must be in other things i eat and drink
Keeping hydrated is very important, i try and have a drink bottle with me as i go about my day and drink all of that, try and do the same. otherwise have a minimum of 2 glasses of water each day, just keep drinking water :)
LOL Sorry, but 8 is the norm. Believe it or not it's not such a difficult thing to do.... One 8 ounce glass before Breakfast, One after Breakfast, One before Lunch, One after Lunch, One before dinner, One after dinner. 1 with a snack, one before bed. an 8 ounces glass is very small you know...very simple to do. If you don't like water, add lemon/lime/etc. also put it in the freezer. It tastes best and very refreshing when Ice cold.
you should drink atleast 10 to 12 glasses of water to keep you fresh and hydrate because it is very important
The Institute of Medicine determined that an adequate intake of liquids for men is roughly about 13 cups (3 liters) of total beverages a day. The AI for women is about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of total beverages a day.
Your urine should be nearly clear. Drink whatever it takes to get it that way. Saying 8 is arbitrary at best. But you should know that most disease, pain, and other issues are largely due to inflammation caused primarily by dehydration.
8 is not too much if your live in country like phillipines
As many as you can.
I'm working on this too. Looking into service dogs or psychiatric doc or emotional support dog I'm doing research I don't know much yet sorry I can't help but know that I'm trying to look too for my anorexia anxiety panic attacks depression bipolar migraines dizzy/vertigo sinus tachycardia passing out(docs can't figure out y) I have no much wrong with me it's nuts
You need to talk to a mental health professional to get your dog certified as an Emotional Support Animal.
Your question reminds me of the famous saying in the Bible where Jesus says, "Who of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?" In other words, you can't make yourself taller by worrying or wishing for it. There are some things you have to just leave up to God or Nature. You are still growing, so give it a little more time and see if you get a growth spurt as many kids do.
You still have a long time to grow! It is hard to tell how tall you will be exactly. Take a look at your parents and see how tall they are. You will most likely be around their height.
I can't imagine how we could say, based on no facts, how tall you might become ultimately. You need to get an x ray to see if your growth plates have fused. If you are female, grown. If a male, try to determine if you are experiencing a growth spurt.
No, there is a very low possibility. You could actually grow about 2-3 inches tho
Very unlikely at your age, although males will keep growing to around 17 years of age. Look at your parents and grandparents to assess your likely adult height.
That is really impossible for anyone to tell. Height is determined by genetics. You can only predict your height by looking at how tall your parents are.
Instead of that i'd download a Weight loss app. That helped me lose 80 pounds. You have to keep track of the exercises you do and the things you eat because exercise alone doesn't do much but tone.
My husband bought a brand new older version of JAWBONE recently for $25. It makes him way more conscious of how much walking he does everyday. And he also has been inputting his calories. He's lost 4 pounds so far but, more importantly, he's feeling better. Since it was only $25 I asked him to buy me one. It's on its way.
Exercise turns fat into muscle muscle weighs more than fat that is why you cant lose weight
If he was smoking you might get the tiniest high. Like less than a hit. It would be like a head ache. Vapor won't get you a contact high. Also weed only worsens disorders like that, so you already had the disorder. You'll be fine. Also if there weren't any signs of the disorder before the marijuana usage you were most likely laced, because it usually takes years for the disorder to progress from marijuana usage in heavy users
I think you're worrying way too much here. I think the vapor isn't going to go all over the house; it would dissipate. I'm not even sure you would get high if you were in the same room as him. But if he is doing it, and you haven't gotten high yet, obviously that proves it isn't gonna happen.
Smoke some weed ad chill the phuck out bro
If you passed the neuro tests, then that should reassure you I get headaches all the time, cluster headaches I just take pain killers and its sorted You can't force anyone to have an MRI, so stick to your optician's advice and hopefully the headaches will improve.
So suddenly headaches and/or migraines suddenly equal a freaking brain tumor? Smh what has this world come to? It's full of idiots.
likely nothing so dramatic. see an hio method chiropractor to check for and correct nerve interference.
I have major anxiety, when having an anxiety attack take deep breaths and play a happy song and sing along to it. When in public just remember nobody is really worrying about what you're doing so just relax. Count in your head how many purple shoes you see or something.
Move to Colorado, if you know what I mean. Or Amsterdam, where it's sold from vending machines.

Cut out any extra calories that are bad for you anyway like soda, fattening drinks, chips, cookies crackers etc. Have a smoothie for breakfast or lunch instead of your usual. Walk at a fast pace for 30 minutes most days.☺
There is no such thing as needing to loose weight. You can need to lose weight.
Yes, I have a brilliant solution. Eat less food.
Eat less. Cut the carbs out of your lunchtime and evening meals. *lose
exercise
Don't eat so much crap.
If you can do 250 pushups, you're already pretty strong.
If you were to do 250 push ups without stopping you can risk over training your muscles which will not help you "get built"
Your chest, shoulders, triceps and core will. But nothing else, you will be disproportionate in the back and biceps and legs, plus you have to do cardio to stay lean and eat right. Eventually your muscles will get use to 250 pushups quick so you would have to switch it up every week almost to keep gainz up

It's difficult to stop, as sweating is a natural reaction. If you think it's problematic, you might want to bring it up to your doctor. For now, though, prepare for it and minimize its effects. Bring along deodorant to work and dress in layers. An undershirt does wonders to minimize the appearance of sweat. Wear clothing with looser weaves, like that of linen, and be sure to bring a handkerchief with you. Also, avoid spicy foods as these can make you sweat much more.
It's impossible
No sweat
go to your doctor for check up. because excess sweating may be indication of heart problem so donot take any risk ....
Keep a low body temperature. Control your breathing and be steady in your movement.
yoga is good for balance and breathing while you exercise and also good for stretching and some core work muscle toning
To me it is good for stretching and finding friends.
Flexibility and strength
In all honesty, no, you're not fat. You would have to tone up a bit if you wanted to be a model, but for an everyday woman, you have a very nice body. This is coming from a woman, and you know how judgemental we are to each other. :) But, seriously, you're not fat at all. Can you please answer mine? https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index...
Nope
Ahh No, why would you even think so?
No not at all :)
Yes, it may take several more years for your breasts to develop. Relax, it's better if it happens later in your teenage years.
Yes, that's completely normal. I got my period when I was 13 (3 years ago) and my breasts have literally stayed the same size.
Yes, its normal that a child wouldn't have boobs yet
try sex or alot of masturbation to help them grow
1-3 times a week
I do it once every other day, maybe twice depending on my mood.
Once a week.
Its not about me. Do you have a question about yourself?
as much as it makes you happy
Eat a bunch of fruits and veg.s , drink lots of water!
Yup. Either drink 1 mug of hot Prune Juice, or eat 10 dried apricots with a mug of Hot water. You will go today.
Take proper and regular treatment after consulting a professionally qualified doctor.
For sure you will grow more, I certainly grew after I turned 21, so a bit of growning left to do!!
so Yuri Zhirkov
Nope your done growing
it depend to your daily activities and environment
I have over 100 lbs to lose, and I've lost 10 so far, but I know working out can speed the process up. But I literally hate it.. It hurts, it makes it difficult to breathe, I just don't understand how people enjoy this.. I stuck to couch to 5k for 5 days but I dreaded having to do it so stopped. I wish I could be one of those people who loved working out.. But I'm just not I guess. Does it take time? Or do you think it's just something that's not for me
When you feel and see the results it makes it much more enjoyable. The first few days are the hardest but when you get into the swing off it it's much easier. Just think that whenever you feel your legs or arms burning, your heart beating and when you're sweating, that's when it's working. That's when you know that you're starting to make a change.

Simple = don't pull it back until it is ready. Many guys do not have full retraction until 17+. I agree with @Roddy that your doctor is wrong = circumcision will make NO difference to size of penis = though I don't agree with his claim for health benefits. Steroid cream will take longer than 20 days = don't damage your foreskin. You are 14 = You have right to decide. You can refuse circumcision = and if any doctor proceeds he can be STRUCK OFF for criminal assault and Abuse. < M
I have a little secret which is that I am a player. I love to satisfy each and every beautiful lady I meet but for that I have to keep my man on its toes. These Prolargentsize pills have enlarged the girth and the size of my penis.
Like WOW. You really are bored, aren't you? If you actually ate a battery, you would not be on here. You would already be admitted to the hospital and in emergency surgery. Beyond that. swallowing regular cadmium batteries is pretty difficult to do. So I guess since you've survived long enough to post this and read through answers you've outed yourself as an attention seeking, bored kid. There are better things to do on the internet than post fake stories to yahoo answers. Just sayin.
Your mom won't be able to kill you if you die. Get someone to take you to the hospital. Batteries don't give you energy. It likely gave you an ulcer.
Plug yourself into a charger because I'm curious to see what will happen. On second thought don't do that just swallow the device it came out of and hope for the best.
1. Stay calm. This happens to alot of people including me. 2. Donuts. Always eat donuts 3. Your mom is going to kill you if you die? 4. ??? 5. Profit.
sounds like a troll, but if you're really telling the truth go the hospital straight away. if it leaks acid into your intestines it's going to be a helluva lot worse than your mom being mad at you
Boring troll, go do your homework.

No. BMI only accounts for height and weight. It does not take into account that muscle weighs more than fat. You can have the minimum amount of body fat, be totally toned and look great, and still be "Obese" by BMI standards.
It does seem accurate and it is used by many health practitioners. However, it leaves me questioning the fat and muscle weight. Are more toned individuals going to be overweight ?
It is a rule of thumb.
How would it make it tricky for sex? Majority of males point upward because that is the ideal angle to use for penetration, the vagina goes upward into the body and you thrust upward during sex. Unless you are trying some odd positions it should not be an issue at all. I know from personal experience a full vertical erection gradually goes downward a bit as you age, but still points more upward than outward. Just don't do positions that are painful or don't work with your normal erect angle.
I never lost my erection. So we went for round 2 Prolargentsize .We were having sex for probably a half hour when my gf made me stop. She said her vagina was sore . . lol. My close friend is Prolargentsize capsule s. It is alway s in my pocket. I order it from Prolargentsize
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked amazingly. Kept getting me hard for almost 4 days and I felt huge! Could last longer the first time , then was hard and ready again in minutes. The second time lasted forever. Well worth it to me!
Most men angles their penis upward and its okay coz you can penetrate deeper i guess, and its more comfortable specially when youre wearing pants coz it just lie down on your belly and you dont have to worry, i was one's downward but after circumcision i found it more comfortable.
Not true. When it's looking you in the face, that's an indication of a good sex drive, and mimics the angle of the vagina, anyhow. It's not something to worry about.
Yep, Nature makes sure you have the right angle for sex. You would fit girl of your age. As girls sag with age , so does yours = LOL. < M
It is normal and should work well in every position. As you get older you won't be as hard as you are when your younger.
What seems to be your problem? Head? Is it 'tricky'?
It's not like every guy is same. Everyone of them has a different taste. No, you ain't the only one.
I'm a woman and not attracted to women at all, but I do know several other guys who prefer bigger women, you're not alone.
no there's tons of men. its actually a fetish and their is tons of websites dedicated to it. so no your not alone. Also some men just dont care, they like the personalty more then her look.
Not a fan either -- too much muscle just looks abnormal on a female.
I'm 5'3" the same height as my mom. My father is 6'. So when I was 12, I decided to measure my pp (if I say you know what it will just block). It stranded at 3 inches erected. When I turned 13 it grew a inch, now at 4 inches. I do masterbate, and my balls look heavy. Not to mention I was 5' when I was 12.
You hit puberty before you started growing pubes and getting erections.
Puberty is named after pubic hair. The whole process takes several years to complete. It doesn't happen all at once. Be patient.
If you even only one pubic hair... then yes you have started puberty. You "start" puberty hit it. Puberty is a 6 to 8 year process.
Hi, I'm a 16 year old girl. I'm 5'6 and 127 pounds. Last june, my breast size was 32C. IN October, I went up to a 34C. I haven't changed bra size since then, but recently little red/purple stretch marks have appeared on my breasts. Does this mean they're done growing? Or they're about to go through a 'growth spurt'? Just wondering, but anyway thanks to anyone who answers (:
I have 34 A boobs (super small) and mine have developed stretch marks. So no, it doesn't mean they'll be big lol because I don't see mine getting there any time soon. As the other comment says it is a sign they are growing but perhaps only slightly. Either way, stretch marks are super normal.
Arganrain pure argan oil is great for people with stretch mark issues. There is a noticeable difference in the areas where I have stretch marks. I would most definitely recommend!!
It means they did grow fast already. It can still continue though. Just so you know, stretch marks are scars, so the don't really go away. They will gradually turn a light color though.
No, it just means that your breasts are growing. Some girls get stretch marks, some don't. Bra size doesn't matter. You may not stop growing until your early twenties, but you may be done. Puberty is like that. It is uncertain.
There is hundreds of types of cancer but that one smoke wont put you at a higher risk but you do know alcohol and junk food put you at the same risk as a smoker? I am nearly 60 years old and probably smoke neraly 40 per day and have done for a long time and as yet I dont have cancer and my dad had lung cancer and died of stomach cancer? Life is too short to worry.
I smoked my first cigarette when I was six years old (1978). I picked up the habit at 15 (1987). I've never smoked more than 10 cigarettes a day. I'm in great health at age 44.
it is called the lottery of life some people smoke all their life and never get the lung cancer other people NEVER smoked and die from lung cancer go figure... ???
no, you will not get cancer as compared to that people who smokes too much but you should avoid it
nothing like the same chance--just don't start smoking again
Absolutely not.
No of course not.
Yeah 50%... you have it... or not.
no you don't
I don't know how to explain it but I just feel numb inside and like I'm empty. I'm not majorly upset by anything recently and I've got an amazing group of friends around me. I hate this feeling! I'm always so happy and bubbly but I'm really struggling to hold a conversation lately and have no motivation to do anythjng
Me too. But I guess I'm a fair bit older than you. And the similarity is up to the 'always happy & bubbly' (because I'm neither of those things), but the rest I can identify with. My life has become nothing more than keeping up a pretence. Basically I'm bored & fed up. And I can't see a way out. I've only said that because t may help you to know you're not alone.
You might have clinical depression which is is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.

I'm planning a road trip, and it will go faster if I don't need to stop anywhere to pee. I've tried using a hose apparatus that attaches to my penis, and also just a simple bottle. The hose seems like the most likely candidate, but every time I try to use it, I just can't force myself to pee. It's like my body knows it shouldn't be doing this, and freezes up. How do I force myself to go, and gain complete control over my bladder?
You don't-- toss the whole bizarre idea. If the hose comes off you get pee everywhere. Plus you do need to stop every couple of hours and get out and walk around to prevent the development of blood clots in your legs. So might as well pee when you do that- or when you stop for gasoline. Difficult to pee in most cars due to the angle you sit- makes it hard to start a stream since you are applying pressure on the urethra down between your anus and balls. Stop and pee and you avoid getting pee all over yourself and car, and won't stink.
Oh, do stop to pee, darling! Getting from behind the wheel and walking a bit will do you good.
You should not be sitting for that length of time. And dangerous to drive for long periods without blood circulation, too. < M
According to this chart, you are a 36a. If you were trying to fit D's into A cup bras, you'd be constantly popping out. You need a bigger band.
Ask dad, an aunt or grandma to take you. If you are wearing bras that are too tight, they will damage your body and cause pain.
you could eek. go to a thrift store with a person you like and find one that has optimal fit and from your friends perspective says looks best, then read the tag.
you can't really get anyone commited unless they pose a threat to themselves or others, or they have stopped taking their medication. doesn't really sound like she would fit into any criteria that would be of concern enough to get her commited. sorry but, your going to have to try some other method and might just have to accept the fact that she is a person too, even though she has mental health issues, she can do what she want's as long as she isn't hurting anyone or herself, there is little you can do. well unless you talk to her doctor, or have the family talk to her and see if they can change her mind.
You can't. Period. She has to be a danger to herself or someone else.... or their is no legal basis for holding her. In New York if she is homeless you can get her hospitalized when the weather turns really bad... we do this with my uncle in Maine... same issue.. but come spring they have every right to live in the woods or where ever else they want to park themselves..... Even the mentally ill have the right to choose...
Talk to a mental health professional. Maybe she would do well in a residential care home situation. I think SS Disability or SSA pays for it.
So I recently went vegan and since then I could already see myself losing weight and I was just wondering if my boobs are going to go away? They are already pretty smaller than others but I'm fine with them but if I lose belly fat will they appear bigger or will they go back to a normal size? This is a issue because I like to prepare for everything. But thanks in advance
Your boobs will change your whole life. if you want to exercise do lateral pull overs and bench presses to build muscle under the boobs.
It depends. That's life. You cannot prepare for everything. I do not lose my breasts when I lose weight but some women lose a cup size or more. So it depends.
Could grow larger.
and that's why you never shave it all off and just trim it so it looks nice
There is almost always irritation involved with shaving. You should just let it grow back and keep the natural look.
That's up to you. Why would you ask other people if you should shave your pubes at all?
You cant. Most women have smaller boobs, we just know how to wear a good bra. The average cup size is only a D due to more than 50% of the population being overweight, and extra fat goes into the breasts too. For a healthy, fit female, its most common to have from an A to a C due to lower body fat. Wait till you can afford surgery (which will cause problems when youre much older, so i wouldnt advise it at all) or just accept that most women dont like there breasts, but theyre perfect breasts weather they know it or not.
I know someone who had small boobs but after her first child they went up several sizes. This is Not a Suggestion to Get Pregnant. My daughter had large boobs and hated them but when she had kids hers went smaller. Boobs are only a small part of who you are. Look at models. Most have small boobs and if they don't they've had surgery. Asians all have small boobs. Many women have surgery to decrease the size of their boobs because they are a strain on the shoulders and get in the way. So the answer to your question is there really isn't anyway to increase your breast size in 30 days.
You don't want to do that. If a man wants a woman only because she has big breasts he's not much . Breasts are only 2 parts of a woman & the most important ones are personality, & a caring mind It's like a man w/ a small organ wishing he had a bigger one. It's not the size of it that matters, it's what you do with it
Ohh wow don't do that. Listen you dont need big breasts to be beautiful or to attract a good man. You gotta love what you have sweet one. Breasts of ANY size can be beautiful. A guy that truly loves for your ❤, will like whatever comes with you. Don't put yourself through unnecessary pain or discomfort for something that isn't you. God blessed you with a great body im sure. So you love it & be happy you got breasts to begin with. Some women don't even have breasts thanks to illness. You still got some & just know that you are perfect as you are ok =)
Try chest exercises that are meant to give you larger breasts and see if it works but if you want to get implants than you can but I wouldn't recommend surgery because it's a waste of time and money but I'd recommend those breast exercises by Natalie Craston along with the bust serum when our 21 because you have to be 21 to buy it.
30days is pretty short... What I'm trying is: First, eat healthy and lot especially soys, cheese, milk and yogurt. At least one of them on each meal. Second. Do chest&back work out. Thrid, massage at least few times a day or whenever you have time. This has changed me from 34B to 32 C:))
Just look at pictures of all the beautiful women with small boobs, then hopefully you'll feel better about yourself. If Shakira got breast implants I wouldn't like her as much.
I get it , u want tops and dressess to look nicer, but boobs are something that can not just grow. If so people wouldnt spend that much money on implants. DO NOT TAKE ANY PILLS OR MEDICANES that claim to work as many people have died from there "herbal" pills. Only thing really is to put on weight amd take the risk of it getting to your boobs amor somewhere elseo
Being underweight (as told by a doctor) is not always a bad thing. Being underweight due to not eating is a bad thing. However if you're like me who eat a healthy amount and just don't gain a significant amount of weight that sticks, no its not a bad thing. I'm 5'9" and 117 lbs. when I should he 132 lbs. So you can see the criticism thin people received for something we cannot change. So just eat until you feel full, stop when you do. And as long as YOU are comfortable with YOUR body, no one else has a say.
It is not always bad, but being underweight enough that you no longer get your periods is a bad thing. It means that your body is not functioning properly because of your weight. You are not looking at your situation in a realistic way because you want to rationalize being underweight.
A vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to such problems. We can't tell if you are getting the required amount of protein, B vitamins, and such since we don't know what you are eating. Numerous other things can cause a loss of periods. You should ask you doctor.
Naa
You don't, sperm is invisible without a microscope and has no color. You are ejaculating blood in your semen, which means you ruptured probably a tiny blood vessel during ejaculation. Not generally a problem if the bleeding is not severe or does not continue to show up when you pee next few times that day.
you need to see a doctor
You're fine you're just having your period

Herbs used for anxiety include PassionFlower (Passiflora Incarnata), Valerian, (some people suffer from valerian hangovers) Lemon Balm, Lavender (tea) Hops, Verbena, Skullcap, and Reishi. Nettle tea, which is recommended by some for panic attacks, may also help, but some people are allergic to it. As with all herbal teas, use sweetening, if desired, BUT NO MILK OR CREAM!
Holy Basil and Ashwaganda may be helpful as they help the body handle stress and ease anxiety which can make it easier to relax.

Do some cardio. Preferably what you can deal handle. Once a week go out for an hour of light jogging. Maybe even incorporate about 12-17 seconds of full on sprinting every once in a while Eat more yogurt. Protein is said to keep people who are looking to diet fuller. Instead of just downing globs of protein shakes for food (which might help if you're weightlifting), yogurt is relatively healthy and has a good amount of protein in it too. Be sure to get Greek yogurt, and a flavor you like

don't ever skip a meal when eating eat slow (gives you time to digest and convince your body into think you're full) use smaller bowls exercise but don't over exercise drink lots of water move around a lot sleep well at night avoid sugary drinks
Unless someone has had depression they wont understand just like mum doesnt and will keep telling you to pull yourself together and get on with life. I have had depression and I still take medication for it so you need to go speak to your doctor about it but in the long run the only person that can help you is yourself - there is always someone out there worse than you, Good Luck
You need to get out of that hellish living situation. I'd be depressed too. You're 18, so you can leave if you wish. Look into student loans for school. Stop looking to her for help and/or understanding. She doesn't have it to give.

Since there is no current medical research to back up this idea, perhaps you should volunteer yourself to get it tested as soon as possible. You would then be able to give a first hand account of why this cannot and does not happen.

Hi, Can performing cunnilingus on a woman cause mouth cancer? What are the chances of getting diseases/cancer if the woman is clean? If both male and female are clean, can the male still get mouth cancer from doing cunnilingus on his woman? I'd love to do it in the future when Im in a relationship lol Please provide as much advice as possible. Thanks.
HPV causes head and neck cancer (I had it). If you go down on a woman who has an active HPV infection, you may be come infected by HPV, which may lead to cancer. Thankfully, you can be vaccinated against HPV. Beyond that, oral sex is not going to lead to cancer.
The only cancer risk from oral sex is ih one of the participants has an hpv infection. Some types of hpv can lead to an increased cancer risk in the area of the infection.
Hi Now where did you ever get such a silly idea like this from. the acid in your mouth would kill off any cancer cells.
How else is cunnilingus done??? MAYBE SHE HAD CANCER TO BEGIN WITH!!!
All STD bacteria and viruses are available by the oral route.
1. If done within your wedlock, no worry. 2. Outside wedlock coitus-means you may get any infection including HIV/AIDS.

Teens need about 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night to function best. Most teens do not get enough sleep — one study found that only 15% reported sleeping 8 1/2 hours on school nights.
You should try to get at least 8 hours of sleep, so going to bed at 9:30 pm, you should have 8 hours by 6 am. The 30 minutes prior to 10 pm is for you to relax and anticipate being asleep by 10 pm.
The average is 8-9 hours of sleep. You only get 6-7, but if it works for you then it doesn't matter.
Probably not really enough to be honest. You should be getting around 8 hours to really let the body re-energize each day.
They say about 8 hours......But SCREW THAT! I do 2 AND IM FFINE! so go nuts..

Basically it's boobs that don't sag. If you have an A cup, there's nothing to sag, so it depends on the tilt of your nipples when they're erect. If they point upwards, you've got perky boobs. Here's an example of perky (safe for work): http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/02/2...
Yahoo Helpline Support@+1^800^256^7021
I could show you but I'd get my account suspended again. The rule of thumb is if you have at least a B cup or larger, if you can insert the eraser end of a pencil up under your boob and it falls out immediately they are perky, or at least you don't need a bra.
Pretty sure you're not a woman. You're just a perverted boy trying to get people to talk about boobs online.
if you have boobs then you would all ready know if they are all ready perky unless you are to young to be on this site
Everyone has their own definition but, IMO, I'd say size B to C without failing the pencil test.
lol
It's quite alright. So long as you can see you don't have to listen, and there is still hope.

I would have been blind a loooooooong time ago if this were true.
If it did then almost all of the teen and adult male population would be blind! How many blind boys are in your class at school? All of them masturbate but probably none are blind or partially sighted!
If you have to ever ask "Is it true" you can almost bet it isn't. And of course there is no logical reason solo sex would be a dangerous act, same physiological act as sexual intercourse. Just using your hand instead of a vagina for the stimulation. People having regular sex don't go blind.
No, masturbation does not render a person blind, nor will it make you grow hair on your palms.
No masturbating will not make you go blind.
Yes dumbass! 99.99% of the male population is completely blind.
No one knows. The typical scales used at home are not very reproducible in their measurements. I can get weights differing by 2 pounds when I weigh myself again immediately after I just did it. Don't worry about it.
Most likely it is simply normal fluctuation. For all of us our weight can fluctuate by as much as 5 pounds from day to day. It is normal.
Yes, no doubt about it.
No way for us to guess that.
Yes your thing sounds like its fine.
Boys are not virgins, only girls. When you say mid teens, what is the age? Most guys are full adult size at 15. Average is 5.16 inches so hopefully you are under 15 and still growing down there.
It's pretty short but it may grow. I say may cause not everyone can be average. I'm 28 and mine too is only 4 inches long erect.
The average female vagina is only like four or five inches deep. As long as you don't end up with a shallow b****, you'll be fine
It is short. No doubt. If you came for comforting which we can see from your so called 'best answers' - good luck to you in your life.. Do not ask if you want to hear BS answers healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...

Here's the thing I've suffered from insomnia and depression stress and anxiety . Ya sucks lol but I've worked on my problems and the last three days been getting 8 hrs of sleep now which is great . Depression anxiety ect is fading and I'm recovering .. But I'm noticing Is that I'm still tired and fatuiged . Is this bcus it's only been a few days of getting enough else and my body just needs time to recover from fatigue ? Or is there something else that could be the prob ? Thanks
Well it's only been 3 days so your internal clock will take time to adjust so feeling tired is normal, especially if this is a sudden change. Another tip would be making sure that those 8 hours are set, so sleeping at 10 pm and being up by 6 am everyday will help as well. If you don't feel less tired in a week or two then maybe you should extend the number of hours to 9-10 (depending on the stress and work during the day) because 8 is the minimum of how long you should be sleeping anyways.
What is an ect?
Semen is what comes out, sperm is invisible without a microscope. Some guys are just able to shoot semen several feet, most guys are lucky to shoot more than a foot.
Dont masturbate for about 3days or a week, thats what i do and i can shoot far like as far as my chest and near neck.(not bad). What you eat also plays a role to that.
The guys who shoot far masturbate a lot, which is why they can shoot far. The more you masturbate, the less thick your semen becomes. It is made of proteins and other nutrients, and thickness can also depend on what you eat.
don't masturbate for a week and see what happens than
they are pros......you arent
I think my unborn child is pregnant. I asked my friend, and he said I'm a moron. Wtf do my religion gotta do with this? When my daughter and grandchild are born, should I get them baptized as morons, or lent them choose their own religion? I am of the vegetarian faith, so I was thinking of baptizing them as that, because they should watch what they eat.
You are acting like a fool and you know better than to think a child in the womb could get pregnant!

It's because autism is more well understood now. When autism was first observed people thought it occured because children were not hugged enough, as time goes by we understand the condition more and more and the criteria for autsim changes. People are starting to understand that it is a spectrum and that more people fit the diagnosis then previously thought. It's not that there are more autistic people, it's that more of them are actually being diagnosed.
i am not sure but i think it has to do with the rhythm of life , kids don't get the affection needed from their parents

F*ck that sh*t, it's totally whack. I am a virgin man and I am proud that my penis has never any where near a woman, I'd rather stick it in a blender. I'm a warrior, I have battled depression, addiction and won! I beat it all. "Behind every great man is a woman". BS, I am a great man and no woman is behind me, I don't need her. I fight my own wars, my own battles, I walk through the mists alone and I come out the other side triumphant and victorious.
Society tells people a lot of things in an attempt to control them. Those who care about what society says conform, others try to assert that they don't need society’s advice and do a song and a dance about it or form a movement as if it means something, and the rest just ignore it and get on with their own lives. Which one are you?
In a blender? I'd rather stick mine in a woman. Even if I were gay I'd rather stick it in a woman. Seriously. Blender. I mean, come on man. But yeah, you don't need a woman, marriage, kids, all that. F' that gynocentric BS. Unless your only other choice is that blender. Then I'd give some serious thought to at least losing that virginity.
Ok.... what has this world come to when a depressed addict calls himself a great man.... But I do commend you for turning your searing loneliness into a triumphant one liner on YA. Should all men take your lead you would be responsible for the complete extinction of the human race in a mere 100 years (give or take a few depending on the ultimate life span of the children born in February of next year. Congratulations.
That helps the government get your balls in a vice-grip, that they can twist and crush any time they like. Men are trapped when they get married and have kids, you are at risk any moment of being stripped of all your possessions, evicted, and forced to pay half your money to a woman and kids for years, that can financially cripple you. Governments like having that power over men so they don't misbehave, and there's more women than men, so political parties try to appeal mainly to women, by pushing policies that give them power over men. Any man who gets married, is a fool.
I agree. The way the divorce system and family court system is screwing over men the only thing I need sustainable physical and mental health, a lot of money, a lot of disposable stress free time to do enjoyable stuff or just chill out and relax, NFL, NBA, my pet German Shepherd Ladybug, family, friends, a beer every once in a while, a friends with benefits(a want, not a need) from time to time, thats it, I'm cool. Keep it simple.
You don't necessarily need a woman, but it would be nice. And it's impressive that you've done all that alone, but maybe it'll get boring after a while and you'll want someone by your side.
Get a good job and work real hard. You can get and keep a nice house. Dress well. Eat well. Travel. Etc. You won't have anybody to drag you down. Make up your mind and do it. You're a warrior!
You are a fool. What's the point in being the warrior, winning all the battles, if you are alone? No King, warrior, Knight, etc. never went at it alone without the beautiful maiden. The battle you're fighting is the losers battle. The battle within to win the war of self. The only winners in that kind of war are the non participants. But you keep fighting yourself WARRIOR!!!!!
Your d!ck would reach her ceiling and its not the best thing to pleasure her. You would have cause much pain on her, but it is possible to take at least have of it but you will look far from her.
no, since her vagina is no more than 6 inches in depth.. if you where to ram home your lump of meat, it would most likely cause her severe pain and bleeding. due to the damage because to her cervix. she would then probably end up not wanting to have sex due to the pain and discomfort caused by your oversize pork chop.
Yep, if she is Lorena Bobbit she will use the carving knife. < M

I woke up yesterday to this white looking blister .. I popped it and it came out with blood , and didn't really hurt . Now it looks like a opened sore but doesn't hurt & it hasn't formed a scab . What can this be ? Last time I shaved was about 3 weeks ago & I have corse black pubic hair . I don't know if this could be herpes or not.. Does it sound like it could be?
It doesn't sound like herpes. Herpes can cause white puss filled blisters, but they usually come with some itching, burning and or tingling symptoms. Could be a small cyst or some irritation. If you need to know, see a doctor and get it checked out.
It sound like an ingrown hair. You could also do a search for herpes symptoms and herpes pictures....
Go to the doctor and get it checked out.
Well I assumed you were male as only males have prostates to stimulate. There are a number or products available that will assist you. The aneros prostate massager will "hit the spot" causing you to have a total release experience. It can be used while you are either masturbating or while having sex.
Quite difficult for most guys. You need a partner or a sex-toy massager like the Nexus. < M

It's an unsanitary, demeaning job, and it definitely does not give you that feeling of self-fulfillment at the end of the day, feeling like you're doing what you're made to do, or like you're helping improve this world. People take the job for the money. It has no other benefit to your life. And if money is all you want, then you're content.

Most women can't have an orgasm while having intercourse. One way that wife and I did it was when I was in her I would finger her clitoris until she had an orgasm and then she would let me finish in her until I had mine.
Learn where your g-spot is. Usually it's high inside on the upper vagina wall and feels like a raisin when deflated. Fingering it will inflate it and get you to orgasm usually. Hitting it with a penis a lot will do the same
by either you or your partner stimulating your clitoris during intercourse or at least using positions where the clitoris rubs against the penis
it is a trial and error process till you find what you need
Maybe I can be of some help.

If you dont know the answers to these questions and why it might happen then you are not ready for sex. Do not give it up in such a casual fashion. Find a trusted male adult in your life and have a talk with him. Do not be embarrassed. Sex is normal and every person on earth does it.
Most females experience pain their first time. Some STDs manifest in males experiencing pain when they pee. You shouldn't do this. She's not a girl, she's a woman and pedophile.
You should never ever have sex with an "Adult" if she is over the age of 16, she can be tried for sexual assault.
This is rape it's not normal. Yes this will cause problems to your health, no you're not ready. Your penis will hurts, that's true because you're still young, she's older than you, and she has had sex with alot of guys, stay away from her.
What the hell is an "adult girl"? LMAO If you mean woman... Yes that's rape. And she can go to prison for that.
its true despite her or your age. the pain you feel when taking a piss is the sperm burning in your penis when it comes into contact with the urine. its completely normal and doesnt hurt after. as for the sex, it should be based on your beliefs and values. you can say no. also check the legal age to have sex in your country/ state. if everything is okay, you can still say yes or no. good luck! :)
No, don't do it, you asked this question somewhere else and I already answered it for you. It's a bad idea, you are not ready.
how about waiting until you find someone with your similar experience instead an old women who has screwed the football team...so to speak
I get anxiety attacks often but don't do anything about them because I'm usually working and don't have time to go to a doctor or be rushed to a hospital. But I'm having them very bad tonight. I can't sit still, my chest hurts, I'm throwing up, shaking, crying, and hyperventilating. I don't have a ride to the hospital and would have to call and ambulance but can a hospital help with psycological problems? Would they think anxiety attacks are urgent enough for an ambulance to get me? I don't know what to do with myself and I have to work tomorrow.
You can call an ambulance if you're that sick. Are you diabetic, on a diet or otherwise malnourished? Lack of nutrients to the brain can cause panic attacks. You're over-oxygenated from hyperventilating. That can cause a lot of symptoms you've described. Breath into a small paper bag, or your cupped hands - slowly. If you feel you can't make it into work tomorrow, call them as soon as possible. If you have a regular doctor, make an appointment, or go into an immediate care clinic for long-term relief. A good work-up with lab work might uncover a medical problem you've been unaware of. If not, there are very successful treatments for panic disorder. Good luck
Due to the fact that you have mentioned chest pain would mean an ambulance would have to attend your home however they have the equipment to check that there are no problems with you physically like ECG tracing and such, they would sit with you and help to calm you down but it is unlikely you would be taken to hospital because there is little they can do for panic attacks.
You can go to the emergency room but all they do is give you a large dose of dyphenhydramine or maybe some Ativan... then they tell you to see your doctor and send you home. Then you get a bill for $2000... just go see your doctor.
not sure you can always call emergency and explain how you are feeling and what you are going through hospitals will normally have an on call psychologist that they will get you to see
They begin growing rapidly at the onset of puberty but thing is few guys ever notice their size before puberty-- so kinda hard to know if they have grown or not. But most pre-pube boys are about the size of marbles so the balls grow several times their previous size. You can look up orchidometer and it shows the sizes of the testicles.
Look Down.

I read your question and The Honest Truth- sounds as though she has bad friends, bad family and a bad ex boyfriend (that's you). If she can walk away from such people and never go back it will be better for this girl. Goodluck friend.
Look everyone has a tough heartbreak in their life so that's y I'm never aproaching girls ever again. My advice is don't think about her at all distract yourself by hanging out with your friends/family. Point is do anything u can to distract yourself and if that doesn't work talk to someone about it
Time heals all wounds. As you have discovered with her reaction the wording also works when reversed - Time wounds all heals. Time, patience and perseverance will accomplish all things.

Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. There is no reason to stop doing it. Its just a bodily function like peeing etc.
There really is no way to fight our male sex drives unless we had our Testosterone removed. Maybe when you get older the desire may wane. But T is very healthy for a guy. If you found a sexual partner that wants sex as much as you do would be a way to stop. It is very difficult to stop because our minds are not in control here, our bodies are calling the shots.
Just a natural urge, but voluntary- so if you want to stop, just do it. Average guy though ejaculates on average at least once daily. All normal.
Thats up to you to determine. There's no reason to stop, so there isn't really any help available for you.
dont stop, masturbation is healthy
Im past 3yr statute.
depends on how much per day you do it
spend less time alone
Yes it's fairly common with boys of your age.
Yes, it is perfectly fine to masturbate with friends if they want to also.
Sure, lots of fun if your friends are all laid back and open to letting it all hang out and doing the deed together.
Sure it is ok Josh. Find a nice cute boy and jerk off with him. Toodles...
Sure, this is normal for guys to do with their friends when you are that age.

There is not nearly enough information to answer this question safely. What is your age, sex, gender? Do you have pre-existing conditions? Are you on other meds? ETC ETC. You should consult with a professional who knows your medical history if you want a safe and informed answer.
just take the recommended dose. then it will not matter whether its safe or not, Viagra is a powerful substance and should not be abused,,
No that's way too much

I'm 21 and an only child. I'm used to being my mom's focus. She recently just got engaged and I realized that if she were to have a baby right now (she's 43 and she could if she wanted to), I would honestly feel like I wasn't really a part of the family. I already live in college, so the entire time she's been with her new fiance, I haven't been there. I sympathize with your feelings. Maybe talk to a counselor in order to figure out your feelings and how to cope with them? Good luck.
REPLACED in your mother's life? You are 19 years old and you will soon be replacing your mother in your own life with a man of your own. Grow up, and stop with the pity party.
Of course it backfired. At 19, you are a legal adult, and your world is not supposed to be limited to mommy.
Instead of thinking you are going to be "replaced" Which you are not....try being the sibling your little baby Sister or brother can count on....
As you are an adult this matter should not arise. It's time you started living your own life instead of living it through your mother.
that's called, a pity party....why do you feel sorry for yourself at 19...wtf?
if you ever have kids you now know what a mistake it is to have kids at that age

I think it's pretty normal for a tall guy...? ;) to have a really huge thing.
You have a nice big dick. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into that size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some degree. You could continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties however many guys get the bulk of their size early on.
No not normal at all, normal adult size is 5.16 inches. Bigger guy physically so expect you to be bigger down there- but not that big- in top 5% of all men. Hung like a mule, dude.
Are you a male or female?
A lot of things in my life have REALLY lost their appeal. Music is really not that much fun. I used to get inspired by what people say but that rarely happens these days. Everything is just **** now. I go round and round in circles with these shitty ideas only to find out again and again I'm right back where I started. My mother does **** up the day for me a lot of the time however. My life feels really, really meaningless a lot of the time. My father is also really, really annoying.

It's possible to lose weight with or without exercise but if you do it without exercise you have to eat a much smaller amount to compensate for the lack of exercise. If you skip breakfast and eat a small lunch and/or dinner, it will start your metabolism burning fat in the morning to make up for the lack of outside calories.
Losing weight is actually mostly about controlling food and consuming fewer calories than your body needs to maintain weight. Even if you don't exercise, you will lose weight on 1200 calories a day. And you can just try to increase your movement throughout the day, even if you don't want to officially work out.
Find exercise that you like. Walking, biking, swimming, anything is better than nothing. Sorry, you can't lose weight by doing nothing!
Well eat healthy. That's 80% of how to get healthy
Rice diet
That'd be stupid, cause working out burns fat so why wouldn't you do it you'll learn to like it anyways
Eat such that you have a caloric deficit.
never skip breakfast, and protein for breakfast is important.
It's wrong. She's not exactly telling you need to workout, you just workout because you have to. So what right do you have to tell her so? what you are looking at is two different personalities. If you cannot accept her lack of interest in that aspect of life, you might consider looking for another person who is into that if it is that important to you. I work out 6 days a week every week. But I do it for me. My boyfriend does not. But I dont care. I accept him for who he is.
My husband is a former Marine. He doesn't have difficulty being kind and sensitive and accepting me for who I am. Unfortunately it's time for you (and your very large ego) to leave her, move on and find someone else who will "actually listen." No, you are not wrong for getting angry when you compare how much time you spend on your appearance with how much time she spends on hers. If I were her, after reading this, you wouldn't have to worry about me any longer.
Shame on you. You can be upset, sure, but you have no right to try to dictate how you want her to look or live her life. If you aren't happy with her fitness and "lack of dietary discipline," find someone more compatible and free her to find someone who loves her as she is.
I was once a very happy and functional girl until about 3 months ago when I was loaded up with antipsychotics. Now I can t even produce one single thought in my head. I spend hours watching tv and staring at the wall. It is very rare if I can even utter more than 2 words. I ve entirely lost my personality and have become a mute .
Zyprexa is an antipsychotic that lowers or antagonizes dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in pleasure, reward-seeking/addictive behavior, but also aggression (toward self &or others) & mania. Antidepressants tend to focus on increasing serotonin. Serotonin helps regulate dopamine & prevent or inhibit the negative aspects of its escalation, such as aggression, by enhancing impulse control & satiety. Serotonin is reliant on Vitamin D & other variable factors such as dietary Magnesium (these are prevalent deficiencies which impact all of health) & tryptophan for its function & is commonly low or imbalanced. Research continues to clarify the importance of nutrition in mental health, w/ the influence of Mg & D deficiencies being assessed as especially problematic for mental health.
You expressed a number of thoughts there and you uttered 71 words.... If you don't like the side effects then go back to your doctor and try a different med.....
Assuming there's a legitimate reason you were given anti-psychotics, it sounds like you're on the wrong medications, but please work your doctor on this. If you don't, you're just going to keep going in circles for years and years. Say to your doctor, "I don't want to feel so numb and blank all the time. We need to make changes to my meds." It will take several months to find you the right meds, but you will if you work honestly with your doctor. If you don't, you're last year will just repeat itself. Also, see a therapist who can help you explore what's going on and advocate for you with your doctor.

I'm a Freshman in a large public High school now coming from a small Catholic school so I've been meeting a lot of new people. But one thing I've noticed, it seems like 9 out of 10 kids I meet either have depression, are suicidal, are on drugs, or have some kind of serious "problem". I think I'm okay for the most part, but what is this? Was a just insanely naive before, or is it just the people I know? Am I wrong to think it's ridiculous that everyday I hear so and so had a breakdown, Person A is in the hospital, person B is in rehab, etc?
everybody has problems and struggles of their own. Some areas may demographically have more people with 'issues' in other areas. The school you go to just probably has a lot of kids that think alike and have same background and demographics. just stay optimistic and help those around you !
Not everyone is depressed. Some people are just sad. Some people pretend to have it, i will never why but they do. People who are actually depressed will never tell you or you will never be able to tell.
The drug companies and doctors convince everyone they have a disorder so they can push their harmful drugs. People seem to like it as it gives them attention and also an excuse to not take personal responsibility. You were probably raised right and realize life isn't always sunshine and unicorns and you have to keep pushing through.
It actually depends. You'll growth spurt will stop till you're 18. Your parents height will affect your height. If your Dad is 6ft and your mom is 5'2ft there is a possibility of you growing taller. I wouldn't worry much about your weight you're a growing girl and you need energy as much as possible.
Kinda very little over average.. I thibk a good weight for 5'1 is 107 pounds
Will you get taller? Probably. Too short or fat? Nope, couple inches taller and then you're just about perfect.
nooo you're okayy
No. You've stopped now
Your head can be itching for any number of reasons...head lice, dandruff, and too many chemicals in your shampoo are just a few of the reasons. If dandruff is your problem, you can try an anti-dandruff shampoo, though I never had much luck with those. I had a lot of success with tea tree oil shampoo. For head lice, wash your hair in vinegar, and then comb it out with a metal comb. For chemical and irritation as well as dry scalp, use a free and clear shampoo that does not contain glycerin, acetate, and other irritating chemicals
Take a shower.
lice? dandruff? not shampooing every day
have a bath
My husband and i had unprotected sex during my ovulation period, the last week of March. I got my preiod on April 12 for about 5 days (usually last 7) and then two weeks later on April 30th i spotted for about 2 hours. I was supposed to start my period on May 9th, but i still have no started. My period has always been spot on 28- day cycle. so im wondering if i am pregnant, or if something could be wrong with me.
Definitely could be...late period X 4 days, when you are usually spot on. Get an over the counter pregnancy test. If it's positive, make a doctor appointment. I'm assuming that you have had sex since your period in April. If the last week of March was the last time you had sex, and then you had a 5 day period April 12-17, then you are not pregnant. A period is your uterus sloughing off the lining because you are not pregnant. If you had a period since the last time you had sex, you aren't pregnant.
since you have had a period after you had unprotected sex you are not pregnant. its more likely to be a slight hormone imbalance
I suggest taking a pregnancy test. It is possible if you're stressing, etc that your period is just late.
Depends if you consider dying from stroke and heart disease natural. Or living with diabetes, knee and back problems, sleep apnea, and being out of breath every time you even slightly exert yourself. People who are obese tend to die sooner than people who are not. Don't you think that is nature's way of telling you something?
Yes.
Completely unnatural. No such thing 100 years ago.
It's not unnatural it's unhealthy
Absolutely.
AGAIN THERE IS SO MUCH PEOPLE IS FATTER THAN ME WHY DONT U MOCK THEM? WHY DO U WHITE AMERICAN PIECE OF SHT JUST JUDGE ME EXXAGERATE? NESSAH TRENG SAME AS UR FAMILY LIKE THAT OI

no
Yeah, the first time isn't exactly the most fun time, but it does get better! I remember my first time very well. It was awkward and uncomfortable. The two of you will enjoy sex more after you are used to each other. She was probably sore because she was kind of dry. Nervousness can inhibit lubrication and arousal, so bring some KY gel the next time. Try to reflect upon the experience and how you might make it better for both of you next time. Here is a link to Cosmopolitan's online magazine concerning the topic. http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/adv...
What the hell? If she was screaming in pain then you were hurting her and you should have stopped long before that, chances are that screaming is an indication that she was no longer consenting - you should be more than regretting this, it's not okay to hurt your sexual partner or continue to have sex knowing that they are in pain. Pain is not normal during sex, the idea women should experience pain and bleeding when they first have sex is a myth.
The first time is supposed to be awkward, painful and bloody.
If she was literally screaming in pain the appropriate thing to do is regret it a lot.
the first time isn't that good...its bloody and painful for girls. second time should be great.

Yes,you care so luckily.
Firstly it can get caught up in all the wires and become a big mess. Secondly the constant pressure of chewing can cause the teeth to begin to hurt. Finally it can cause brackets to fall off. Hope this helps you! :)
because its supposed to stick to your braces, even though it doesn't. my orthodontist lets me chew sugar-free gum but I use all sorts and it does nothing. it makes no difference, so there's basically no reason that you cant. chewy candy is different because it is harder and can break off your brackets, but gum is softer, so it won't have that effect.
Cuz if it gets caught in the brackets then it'll be difficult to get out and you'll see gum whenever you smile.

"Can humans to live 150 Years old?" It's possible it can happen. that a person could live to one hundred fifty years old. However it's not currently all that realistic. Most people who live past one hundred years old, the basically body wears out. However it will be more than just medications, but organ cloning, and replacements, that will lead to longer lives, where living to one hundred fifty years old or older will come into play. Which means the risks of organ replacement rejection will not decrease, so will the need for anti-rejection medications. However at this point in time, that's not realistic. That could be another one hundred years, or more into the future.
i think so. it'll just be very hard. and as sinead said probably has medication improves, we find more information about diseases we'll be able to live longer. the oldest person ever lived was Jeanne Louise Calment and she lived to be 122
It's hard to tell. I would say yes or no. Depending on health conditions.
God said maximum 120 years.
I don't think so. Maybe in the future if medicine improves
No
Yes because smoking and alcohol are cause
Sometimes they can, but not always. There's really no way of knowing if that's what caused it either. If you smoke or drink, doctors will always assume that's the reason.
They can

Because it's a fact. What's the point in you atheists getting so butthurt about it if you don't believe it?
Mostly it's because they actually believe it's true. Some even think they are trying to help. As if telling us about their imagination will change our minds. Like "Oh no.....an ancient mythology says I will burn in hell, I better believe it"!!
Christians are telling the truth after seeing the travel ticket in the possession of those Atheists. There is a valid point in it, which you have to infer. You should know that their mental health is now seriously affected.
They are excited about their salvation and want to make people aware of the consequences for their choices in life. Really I have no concern where you go after you die. I know where I am going or at the very least I am a better person for how I try to live my life towards God. trust me I would be doing what I want to do way more. But I fight against those urges to please God and be a good husband and Father. I agree it is not the best "sales" approach
I think only the nuttiest of Christians get in arguments with atheists. The things they say are often decidedly unchristian.
Not much, really. They are, but, so? I MUCH prefer to talk about the joy in the love of God for us. It makes religion attractive. Trying to scare people in to believing is not very successful in my opinion. Offering them "Good News," hope, and love is a better way to go.
The next time a Christian has a valid point, it will also be the first
I got told that I have last week and I have told a few of my teachers about my cancer and some believe me and some don't. I do worry that some teachers won't believe me that I have brain cancer. But I have been trying to get the school to give me a donation. The reason I think that might give me a donation is because they have donated to other kids with family issues. I do have piano and I do feel that the piano teacher needs to know that I have brain cancer.
Bring in a note and tell your guidance couselor yu need to have a group meeting with your teachers detailing your diagnosis.
I'm a teacher (medically retired) and I don't believe you have brain cancer. See TrueSnapdragon's response.
I don't know and each persons candida came into being from different circumstances and all have differing systemic grips on the body.....never heard of that one, but good luck....just do a regular search

Eating a ton is really relative person to person. If you're not getting bigger, then you're still not eating enough, plain and simple. Add a couple hundred more calories to your daily goal and then just continue adding more calories until you start gaining.
You are OK the way you are

I just started to use Vaseline as lube when I masturbate. It does help a lot with the sexual experience. I'm still having trouble ejaculating semen when I masturbate with lube. Could it be that I might not be giving it enough time? When I masturbate I think it is about 10 minutes at a time. Is that long enough or does it take awhile to ejaculate semen?
Because lube is not needed. Most guys never use any type of lube when they masturbate. It's messy and completely unnecessary.
Ejaculation depends on guys, amount of time and the last time we ejaculate. Give it a little more time so that you will be able to cvm. It actually takes time to ejaculate... Take it slow and feel the urge. Have fun bro.
10 minutes is a good time considering many guys will fire off way faster than that. Longer is better of course, since means you may last longer with a girl. (or guy if you hang that way). But go slow on your strokes and focus on your mental arousal too.
Your body isn't ready to do that yet. You will in future however for now you get all the feeling with none of the mess to clean up.
it takes from 30'' to 60', is personal. but if you are not developed enough, it can't be
You might have clinical depression which is is common but easy to treat. It means your brain does not produce sufficient Serotonin--- Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Tell your doctor/nurse that you are terribly depressed and would like some help with it. It's nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed by. They will refer you to the right source for help with your problem. Good Luck.
Why do you have to tell her you're depressed? Just say you're stressed out, and think therapy would work.
tell her the truth. tell her what happen. u can cry while talking so she knows that ur sad or upset. I'm sure the nurse will help u with this and make u feel better.
Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 1-800-273-8255 Google suicidal thoughts.
I actually feel your pain, for almost 5 years now people just vent all their emotions to me, it feels terrible, i've never thought of suicide, but i dream of being dead. It is not worth it, do this: when no one is home just go through the house and scream all the bad things in your head, it helps. Life is precious. You seem like a really nice person, do not take your life. Go to the hospital ASAP they will commit you to a mental hospital and you WILL get the help you need. god bless and enjoy life! YOU MATTER!!!
Listen to Slipknot.
If you haven't already GET TO HOSPITAL. The amount you've taken is really bad and if you don't go you're at risk :( hope you'll be okay really do

I don't approve of a homosexual lifestyle, and I was once in a bathroom with a "lady" who was obviously a dude. It didn't make me feel uncomfortable. Where else are those men supposed to use the restroom? I'd rather they use the ladies' room than being beat up in the mens' room. God gives people free will and it's not our place to judge others for their choices. And I certainly don't think he would want people to be victims of violence because of other people trying to take away their free will.
We let Conservatives Dennis Hastert and Josh Duggar use the restroom for years, and Conservatives didn't bat an eye. FACT: more likely to be assaulted in the men's room by a Republican than a transgender person.
We don't. Let's start a resistance movement against cis-gendered men who are trying to hide their predatory behavior behind trans people. A powerful one, where we knock them on their butts.
These are the same liberals who want homosexuality taught to first graders. And that is no joke
How else are they going to go to the bathroom? Fool.
That's pretty dangerous, don't do it.
NOT recommended. you need to be alert for possible side effects of the Rx

It really gets on my nerves when doctors feel the need to medicate everyone. Why don't you try intensive therapy instead? I suffered from serotonin syndrome myself many years ago, and I would NEVER consider going on another medication again. It took me so long to recover completely, around a year. I worked through my issues without medication and with a clear mind, with the help on therapy and working through things on my own. If you're going to cover up your problems with medication then you're never going to learn on to get better on your own.
You could also try an MAOI, or a tri-cyclic. And therapy is always a good idea, medication or not.... Therapy can teach you about your disorder, coping skills, distress tolerance, mindfulness.... These are always beneficial to anyone with any mental disorder (and even people without).

Should'a mentioned, I'm a Southerner, guys. My animal-food budget isn't very big to begin with, it doesn't have to be because I buy cheap meat, so it won't be adding much to my veggie budget. While other people might be wasting $15.00 on a corned beef or something, I've got a package of chicken hearts for $1.50. That is not much in veggies. Like, what? One bag of industrial carrots, a tomato and a half? =/
The biggest thing I would recommend is stocking up on dried beans. You can get 2 pound bags of pinto beans at the Dollar Store and 1 pound bags of brown rice for 87 cents at Walmart. Get good at prepping those bad boys and you'll find that you can replace or supplement meat with beans in just about every meal provided you do a little prep work (you said that you are cool with that though so you're golden!). All that extra green you save by cutting down your animal meat consumption can be used to buy organic veggies from the farmers markets and such.
Healthy cheap omnivore diet sample, 3 meals with 2 snacks- Breakfast- 2 scrambled eggs with light cheddar 1 piece whole wheat toast with light butter 10 oz tomato juice Snack- banana with 1-2 tablespoon peanut butter Lunch- Turkey burger with lettuce, tomato and mustard on whole wheat buns baked sweet potato fries bottle water Snack- 1 cup cottage cheese mixed with 1/2 cup diced pineapple Dinner- 6 oz pan seared tuna patties baked potato 1 cup green beans bottle water
Balls don't drop- just get bigger dude. They dropped at birth or before. But in puberty and 13 so should be able to ejaculate now, just need to intensify your stimulation. try this: when you are ready to "finish" use your groin muscles to tighten up your scrotum repeatedly, like you are trying to pull them upward. This should tighten your ball sack really tight at the base of your shaft, and often this action will jump start the male climax- an all over tingling sensation, followed almost immediately by the ejaculation. Give it a try.
Ejaculation is next to precum, masturbate a little more and you will surely ejaculate. And i assure yoy, c.um is really good.
No problem
give it more time and it will happen
You produce about 200,00 sperm per minute. Takes a couple months for the sperm to mature and be ready for release. Will stay ready for release (couple hundred million per load of semen) for a week or so, then they die and are replaced with newly mature sperm. Never ending cycle, you never run out.
There is no maximum amount of sperm, if sperm isn't used it the cells die and get re-absorbed back into the body.
it get adsorbed, and yes there is a max, = size of vechicular glans that hold it
sperm is invisible

Why would you want to? I assume if you are in an ambulance, you are probably a patient and, if so, the last thing you will be thinking about is masturbating.
yes
yes, but not comfortably. Especially if there is a medic with you.
Jeeze! how much room do you need?
Uh no
What kind of question is this?
No
Used to when I was younger. Haven't masturbated in 4 years, because I can't have erections anymore.
I usually masturbate only once a day, though occasionally I do it twice if I am really horny :-)
Lots of teen guys do it twice or more.
looks like every one but you
Yeah I do!
lots of guys and girls do

So I got punched in the testes a few weeks ago. My testes started hurting afterwards but the pain subsided after a week. The pain just came back this week. I searched up what could've happened and the symptoms that I have are similar to those of testicular cancer. Could I have developed testicular cancer by receiving that one blow to my testes? I did show a doctor and he said that it looks normal externally and he told us to do a ultrasound. but it does hurt in one of the testes down there.
First off the education system has clearly failed you. Cancer is the result of a cell multiplying uncontrollably. Being punched in the testicles will cause pain like anywhere else and cause inflamation. You can perform self exams on yourself by feeling around your testicles to see if there are any unusual lumps.
and that's why we should never self diagnose ourselves and see a doctor and get tested

i'm currently 15 and my height is around 5'7-5'8. My mum's height is 5'5 and my dad's is around 5'10-5'11, so i think that i'm still going to grow taller at least a few cm. The thing is, i don't enjoy being that tall. My current height isn't so bad, though i do feel a bit uncomfortable when i see girls who are shorter and look cuter and all that, it's a bit degrading. Anyways, am i still going to grow even taller or is there a possibility i'll stop here? Do guys like tall girls or do they go more for the shorter ones? This has been worrying me for a while now.
I'm 13 and I'm 5ft 10 lol. Being tall is great! Ok, I do feel pretty self-conscious about my height sometimes, but alot, I just get people saying in awed voices that I must be so good at basketball and at reaching for stuff on really high shelves. Plus, it gives you a better chance to model if you want:) tall girls unite woo btw you won't stay shooting up and up forever. I'm slowing down already. Thank god I thought I'd never stop :)
Nahh, I doubt you'll grow anymore. I'm a 15 year old girl and I'm 5'10, but I've been 5'10 since I was 13. And being tall isn't bad because tall people/girls are most likely to have better bodies. We have long legs and arms and everything is proportioned better. Just think of yourself as an exotic supermodel, and all the short girls are shrunken midgets with the bodies of average frumpy housewives. Lol idk, but don't be weird. Tall is awesome :D
I'm 14 and I'm a bit taller than you...idk I've never really thought about it. From what I know, guys like tall girls and short girls. I wouldn't worry about it.
I'm 5'7" and it's a great height for a girl (although I didn't think so as a teenager). At the age of 15, you're done growing, so you can relax about your height.
There's a 15-year-old in my class who is going on 6 feet. You are slightly above average, but that's nothing to beat yourself up about.
Guys love tall girls.
I'm a boy and I'm 15 and already 6ft3" so I don't think you have anything to worry about cuz I like taller girls
I'm having Gynecomastia surgery tomorrow, and I understand Gynecomastia comes from hormones imbalance. So, after the removal shouldn't I check my hormones? Or after it's removed everything goes back normal? I had my Gynecomastia since puberty(I'm now 25) but suddenly the past two months it started to hurt me and I feel like it's growing and that's why I want to remove it. Also, do you think this hormonal imbalance I have is affecting my muscle growth? (I am not using steroids) (I rely on protein and carbs supplements for 2-3 meals of my day)
Those are questions for your doctor. Butt hormone imbalances use it taken care of much earlier than 25. I had gynecomastia when I was a kid and by the time I was fifteen my breast shrunk down to normal boy size. My hormones balance out on their own. But the doctor told me that they would have to put me on testosterone if it didn't. I kind of wish I had my penis was always small and never did grow and develop like other boys.
Ask the doctor but i would presume if the hormones are faulty they would need to be fixed before the surgery or the boobs would grow again - my grandson has had this problem since around 9 years old and was told nothing can be done till he is 18 so doctors appointment within few weeks but doctor will check his hormones before they consider surgery, it hasnt affected his growth in height or penis size as he is 6ft 4in, Good Luck
The surgery should take care or any problems you're having, i wouldn't worry but if the surgeon doesn't fix it, well get a new plastic surgeon to fix it right, he just needs to remove all the breast tissue and when it's go e the hormones should find and nice equalibrium
(ノ◕‿◕)ノ*: ･ﾟ✧ Hi from France ✧ﾟ ･:* \(◕‿◕ヽ) (Je suis Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Bruxelles / I'm Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Brussells) Let's say that while we smoke, we don't eat. So it makes you eat less calories. The best is to NEVER start to smoke and just eat healthy, so : avoid useless food : sodas, ice-creams, candies, cakes, chocolate bars. If you smoke even 8 every 2 days, little by little you will be addicted to tobacco. After that it become very hard to quit + all the damage tobacco generates in our body ( lungs, hearth, etc.. ) Avoid this cr@p, OK ? ~~ Have a nice day ~~ Cat.
The stuff works. it's no miracle pill. You still have to do the other 90% of the hard work for this to have much effect.. But I like it because it's not so extreme on the body like other Fat Burners. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea gives me a clean energy boost when I need it, helps suppress my appetite, and gives me those extra deep cuts that I need for my modeling profession
Probably not if you haven't noticed it yet. This is bad advice, but drinking beer makes me not hungry.some days I'll just drink and not eat at all. Then the days I don't drink I eat like Crazy and my weight is good! Wow. I just gave crappy advice.lol. sorry
X was a big smoker, but still had a large appetite and ate heartily until he became ill. X died two months ago, cancer, age 54.
no, it does not. smoking is bad for you. It can cause lung cancer, heart disease, and (chronic) respiratory disease
no it just reduces appetite.
Suicide is a scary thing. Trust me, I have done maybe thousands of hours of research on committing suicide and every time I think I've found a new method, I research that to see what the consequences might be if I live. I would much rather live my life the way it is now, compared to as a vegetable in the hospital, with NO control over my life whatsoever. Writing in journals have helped for me, and reminding myself that life is a lot shorter than it seems.
Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It's an excellent antidepressant that works wonders once your body gets used to it (2-3 weeks)
It will be nice is a person die straight away, but what if half way to death, you doesn't want to die anymore? what if the knife isn't shape enough to get u killed? what if the building isn't high enough to get u killed? what if your body is strong enough for the knife to get u killed? what if your body is so strong that 50 floors, doesn't kill you...do u know how much suffering you will go through? Don't just think about killing yourself, think about the process, think about the people around you. hugs
If all you can think of is limited life in yourself when the entire world is out there to explore, I suppose you're so far down into a rut that it makes no difference.

I know everyone says it s normal and all but i m only fourteen and I get a lot of discharge every single to where it wets the front of my pants. sometimes it smells fishy and sometimes it s odorless and I just want it to stop. it s embarrassing and annoying and I can t even tell the difference between my period and discharge because it s THAT MUCH. please help
Um...a few things. You more than likely have an infection if it's smelling fishy. And if you can't tell the difference between discharge and your period, that means that your discharge is not even WHITE OR YELLOW and that you should probably high-tail it to a doctor NOW.
Sounds like you may have BV which can be checked and cured. See a gynecologist
its normal. NEVER wear pantyliners. you should start eating the discharge. it tastes AMAZING. try it
So I went through puberty years ago with pretty clear skin, but now for some reason I have a ton of acne, on my face, my back, and my chest. Some of it is cystic acne too which really hurts, and I've tried so many otc creams and I'm taking the birth control pill (which didn't help with my acne) but nothing works. Any tips to get rid of it or any ideas on why I'm breaking out now?
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I do not recommend that you get on birth control to manage your acne. Birth control pills have a lot of negative side effects. Instead, get bevoline by skin divine. It's a lotion that has worked for me and should work for you. They are now also offering it on Amazon. I hope my answer helps. Good luck!
See dermatoligist
Yes definitely. Do 500 situps everyday, so that you loose weight instead of gaining MUSCLE just by pushups
Reduce the amount in your meals and replace WHAT you eat with healthier things, cutting out all sugars, replacing most carbs with protein or vegetables.
Consult a good dietitian or doctor. They can only help you in such critical junctures.

Try to hide it for fk sakes. And yes it's normal, just hormones in a wack and crap, when I was younger I'd get a ***** EVERYWHERE! I mean everywhere, on the bus BAM in school BAM sitting there doing nothing BAM wasn't even looking at anyone or thinking of anyone just bam bam bam bam bam bam bam BAM. BAAMMM BAAAMM!M!!! BAM! BMAMBAMMABMAMMBMAAM So many erections. And now, it's way more rare.
It's normal, you get aroused and you get an erection, don't get embarrassed. I had the same problem when I was a teenager.
O good = it works then. Wear a longer shirt. < M
i look at an image of hillary clinton to make my errections go away
Yes you're born into this world and then you die but its that time in between that keeps it interesting.
That is not true at all. My Grandfather died nearly 30 years ago and I still reminisce about his life to this day. I know he would have enjoyed my wedding and I wish he could have been there...But he was there in spirit...I will never in my lifetime forget him.
The point is to have fun when you can!
Rejoice, death is not the end.

Over the pat few months, I've been really tired a lot, but i figuted it was just sleep deprivation. Bit over the past few ddays, I've noticed slight pain in my left testicle. Today I got really fizzy at work and almost past out but I figured it was low blood sugar since I hadn't eaten in a while. But now I'm feeling a little nauseous. Should I see a doctor?
Look up testicular self exam. You can palpate your own testie to feel for lumps. What you are experiencing does NOT necessarily mean you have cancer. It would be a good idea to make an appointment with a dr for an exam and some bloodwork to get an accurate diagnosis.
Yes, see a doctor.It doesn't sound like cancer. More likely epidydmitis, which is an infection in the testicle.
As the tumor slowly grows, it will cut-off the flow of blood & HURT LIKE H#LL !!! Won't hurt to see your doc, but no, I doesn't sound like it.
No
Learned to change a diaper when I was 3 or 4. Baby involved was my brother. Later on babysat and needed to change diapers. On the same subject, an inability to change diapers does not make one unable to take care infants or else no child would be allowed to go home with his parents from the hospital especially when they were first born. A so-called expert eMT claims the opposite.
I'm not much into diaper changing and butt wiping, but I will be happy to dish out the spankings.
yes, all babies are equal, the only difference is babies from strangers and your biological/adopted baby is that you spend more time with your biological/adopted baby and give him or her an extra 324 kisses a day than you would a baby from a stranger, simply because there is not enough time to give him all these kisses. If the baby is adopted then the attention has to be increased by 300% to make them forget or at least accept in a peaceful and comfortable way that they have gone through (if anything) bad stuff before he met you, that is for as long as he needs. AM I EXAGERATING?
So you've brought home your little bundle of joy -- now what? Though taking care of your newborn can be one of the most special and rewarding experiences of your life, you may feel at a loss for what to do and will need to give your child constant attention and care. To take care of a newborn, you need to know how to give your baby the rest, sustenance and care that s/he needs -- as well as a healthy dose of love and affection.
If I had a penny for every time I have been peed, pooped, or vomited on by a child that isn't mine, I would be a millionaire I do believe. I'm only 17, too. Babies need to be taken care of because they can't do it themselves. If I need to do it because their parents aren't around for some reason, I will. They are natural bodily functions and they can't help it.
OMG I've taken care of other peoples kids since I was 5yrs old and helped my mama in the nursery at church! If it needs doing, you best be taking care of that baby IDC who it belongs to or doesn't belong to it doesn't work like that. The care of that child first. So you got poop, pee or vomit on you. Last time I checked nobody's died from it. I've had it happen IDK how many times and I'm not dead. You will be OK. BTW I don't have children
I have never ever changed a diaper in my life and I'm 72 and I never will.

before i thought it was just a phrase but now I'm beginning to think that I might actually be gay. i have tried really hard to watch straight and lesbian porn but i can never get off from them. i only can get off from gay porn even tho i always feel really bad watching it. i also have a girlfriend rn and i really like her and she really likes me as well. but, tbh i don't know if i can pull off having sex with her. luckily she never asked but I'm afraid if we ever do have sex i won't be able to get turned on btw im 14.
Boy if your age is on the clock don't go for the c0ck. And if you're under 18 then stay off any flesh muscle that'll give you a grin of sexual supreme. You might be gay. You might be bi. Label whatever you feel attracted to sexually. But it's not the end of the world if you can't decide...
Normal that many guys in their teens go through a phase of bi-curious behavior, and most swing back to being straight. Just fluctuating hormones. Certainly not gay if your girlfriend turns you on.
Pretty much you're on the cusp of self realization that you are gay son.
you are definitely gay. not saying there is anything wrong with that. you are who you are. no straight guy would be into gay porn. they would only be into lesbian or straight porn
Water
Your daughter knows when she's thirsty and when she's not. Don't try to make her drink more. I would definitely advise against Gatorade, if only because that's basically just sugar substitutes, corn syrup, citric acid, and water, with basically no nutritional value. The pedialyte wouldn't hurt her, but seriously, just relax. If she's thirsty, she'll drink.
Water, the electrolytes will come from an appropriate nutrition. Gatorade has too much sugar and Pedialyte is expensive to make her drink it regularly.
Water is the best hydration. Soft drinks only make you more thirsty.
Water is best of course. Gatorade's good. There is also water in a lot of food.
Water is the best, but if you want to add more variety to her diet, coconut water is a good option.
If you stop masturbating there will be no adverse physical effects. You may find that you are very tense at times with a great urge to masturbate. There is nothing wrong with masturbating. It is quite normal to do it.
Sure many guys go without sex even solo sex, but just be warned that if you abstain for a long time- 6 months or longer, your sex drive will slow down and even basically disappear. Use it or lose it is applicable to your man gear. Not sure your reasoning, since ejaculation is a normal part of being a male, but certainly something you can decide not to do.
Nothing should happen if you stop masturbating, but I don't know why would you want to do that.
it's fine for you to do that and you'll just have more wet dreams
Okay, good luck with that.
I'm 13 and always depressed. Between mess ups at school, being a lazy person when it comes to work, being a procrastinator, etc, etc, I'm always depressed. I recently got blamed for something I didn't do and got punished for that which adds on to the depression and stress. I have no one to talk to (my parents would get mad at me, my siblings are too young, my friends aren't up for that, etc) so what should I do? I can't keep being this way without eventually killing myself but I don't see anyway out of this. Can someone help please??
Well ya - you do need somebody to talk to. We're a sort of social animal - and we can only really understand ourselves though somebody else's eyes. Pretty normal to be depressed at your age - parents who don't communicate sure don't help.
I was just like you... and I tried to kill myself twice by 15. You HAVE to get help. It's scary, I know, but if you don't it will only get worse. Talk to a school counselor, and at least try your parents. And if you ever really want to hurt yourself, call hotline, and if that doesn't help call the police. I've been in your position man, and it sucks, but you have to get help.
In the morning when I wake up my stomach is usually pretty flat with a small bump at the bottom and then I eat breakfast which is usually fruit and whole wheat bread it gets big again. My abs are super strong but there is a layer of fat covering them and I can't get rid of it! Please help me I don't know what to do!!!!!
Eat a very healthy diet. Go for a brisk 45 minute walk twice a day if you can, everyday. Climb lots of stairs. Drink plenty of water. If at all possible start a weight lifting/strength training program at a gym and get some instruction from the gym trainer. But you can also start a program at home using household objects for weights and also by doing exercises that use your own body weight - push ups, squats, lunges, dips, planks, etc. Use google to your advantage and learn about these exercises. It will work.
When in peak shape for high school soccer I ran a lot. My belly stayed round. When I did a year of sit ups I started with a soft round belly and ended with a hard round belly. When in buff shape for boot camp I marched a lot. My belly reduced the most of any time of my life. I have no idea why marching - fast walking - works better than running, but marching is definitely better for belly reduction.
You can go a bit further and concentrate mainly on diet. A moderate amount of exercise would always be beneficial without going to extremes. Once good habits are established, you don't need to think much about what to do. Then, once you notice results, you can always take your knowledge a bit further and get even better outcomes.
Exercise.
Eat healthy
Don't panic and don't be overly self critical. How old are you? Teens can often lose weight by eliminating chips and cookies.
You can buy a flesh light. They are even better than real pussy.
I jerked it in my car or at the beach where chicks could see me. Hot hot hot...for me...problematic for the cops and the chicks involved.
There are many ways to do it. www.jackinworld.com has most of them.

I'm 16,male and have no family history of any cancer or diseases. For just over a month I have experienced lower left and right abdominal pain. I also get ache in my hips and legs sometimes . I have had diharria once and was constipated for a few days. A week ago I had a tiny amount of blood when I wiped. It was just a a small amount and was red. My poo has been fine since and I still poo a normal amount but I still get the pains. What is this disease? Hope it isn't cancer.....
Not even remotely close to even being considered cancer in any way shape or form. It is likely you have one of MANY bowel issues. Speak to your doctor as suggested before.
Sounds like IBS or a food intollerance
IBS & a displaced solar plexus.
You need to see an M.D. That could be cancer, and no, you're not too young to have cancer.
go to the doctor and get a colon screening.
Could be anything.
It makes me dizzy.
Should just be temporary, due to blood concentrating in the penis during masturbation. Just lay down for a while after solo sex and should be fine.
its not supposed to make you dizzy, you should have a doctor look into that
you are suffering from malnutrition eat lots of beef burgers
No. Guilt perhaps. < M
Well, if you are not aborting, go to your local crisis pregnancy center for help or give your child up for adoption
Adoption.
How did you "accidentally" get pregnant? Did you trip and fall on his lap, and you both happened to be naked? You had sex. Anyone knows that sex leads to pregnancy. There is no "accident" about it.
You are pregnant, i would abort it if you cant keep it - as so many kids are stuck in adoption.
it sounds like you're experiencing ocd tendencies and definitely attacks, but no one can diagnose you based on this info or w/o being a therapist id assume. hypocondria tendencies might go into play here too
OCD is Obsessive compulsive disorder. Google it. There are specific obsessive thoughts that result in various behaviors. Hypochoondria is when you think a little bug bite is cancer, every pain is cancer, etc. Hearing voices is something else. You need to go to a therapist, counselor, etc and get thoroughly evaluated.
You don't need to have your mom in the room. The gynecologist will not tell your mom anything you don't want her to know. You should not lie to the gynecologist though. Tell her the truth. Since you and your boyfriend have had sex once, it is very likely you will have sex again in the not too distant future. That is just the normal progression of things. So this is the perfect opportunity to talk to the gynecologist about birth control.
To Jocelyne.. Maybe you're the one who's young minded?? You're the one who spelled *offense wrong lmao. And as for the questioner, you sound smart, and youre only a year away from being a legal adult. Losing your v card at 17 is a lot better than losing it at 13 like most of the people i know. Maybe you should tell your mom..? Anyhoo, there is no medically proven way to tell i you're a virgin or not(you can look more up about that) so dont worry.
you can ask for your mom to not be in the room or try to tell the gynecologist while shes not listening or something. you should really let the gynecologist know though and i dont think they have to tell your mom
It is always wise to tell the truth to your doctor. She may be able to help you with birth control, or answer any questions you may have about sex or your genitals. She will also likely talk to you about the cervical cancer immunization. These are all important topics to discuss. She will not reveal any confidential information. You can tell her that you do not want your mom to know. Take care!
The doctor will not tell your mom it is confidential. You always need to be honest with your doctor about sexual activity, drug use, anything that can effect your health. It is there job to make sure you are healthy.
you should probably tell the truth they would some how find out if you are going to have a test also you can tell the nurse not to tell your mum but tis better for her to know.
you can ask mom to give you some privacy if you have to show your hoohaa, tell doc you did it once but will not be doing it again anytime soon, ask her not to tell mom you made that one mistake
Vision correction with lens is for astigmatism. Astigmatism is an optical defect in which vision is blurred due to the inability of the optics of the eye to focus a point object into a sharp focused image on the retina. This may be due to an irregular or toric curvature of the cornea or lens. The two types of astigmatism are regular and irregular. Irregular astigmatism is often caused by a corneal scar or scattering in the crystalline lens, and cannot be corrected by standard spectacle lenses, but can be corrected by contact lenses
Glasses allow you to see better. They do not change your eyes. But glasses do not change your eyes for the worse. What happened to your friend is that his/her eyes got worse anyways. I suspect you are a teenager, and this type of progression is entirely typical, and is NOT caused by wearing glasses. Think about it. You know those adults who are wearing glasses? Their eyes are not continually getting worse.
I'd take vitamins and minerals, to insure your vision don't get worse...
My husband has been wearing his for 20 years, and his has gotten better, in fact he no longer needs his glasses for close up anymore.
Take her to speech therapy. She is not mental. I am sure about that. She is your friend. Explain to her kindly and get to know her problems. Eventually she will understand. I hope you succeed in doing that.
how long has she been doing this for? you don't tell us her other symptoms, like how are her facial expressions? monotone, drastic changes, 'normal', ? by just that though, she does not sound 'mental'. perhaps she struggles with words? maybe you should ask her why she does this, tell her to write it down if that works better, if not, then yes tell her parent hope things go well!!
don't screw with her......you can lead a horse to water but can't make them drink. in other words, she needs to ask for help
hi its ur friend here, i am not talks in more than one sylls cuz it is too hard for me, and i reals cant deal with ur fat face ens more i know u r reals the ments one and reals i cANT DEAL WITH U ANS MORE SO IM GIVS UP ON U
Me and my boyfriend have been arguing for like an hour, please put us out of our misery. So... Does everyone in this entire world have diabetes in their system or genes or whatever? He was saying "Everyone has diabetes". I'm not diabetic, but do I still have diabetes? I know anyone can get it but I don't have it I don't have the symptoms I don't have to take the pills Anyone help? Smart people lol my brain is fried. Thank you :)
Key facts * 347 million people worldwide have diabetes. * In 2004, an estimated 3.4 million people died from consequences of high fasting blood sugar. * More than 80% of diabetes deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. * WHO projects that diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death in 2030. * Healthy diet, regular physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight and avoiding tobacco use can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes.
Not everyone is diabetic. Many people still maintain healthy sugar levels without watching their diet or using medication. Therefore, they are not diabetic.
Diabetes is not a virus or bacteria, but a disease affecting the pancreas. You don t have it in you per se, but your body stops working correctly. The first analogy I thought of would be something like a nail: If you hit it with a hammer at the wrong angle, it will bend and become useless, but it didn t have a bend in it to start with. It s much more complicated than this in reality, it s usually caused by an over stimulus that triggers a false response. All in all, your boyfriend is correct.
No, my friend, your boyfriend is 100% incorrect. You only develop diabetes when your blood sugar (glucose) level remains higher than the 'normal' range for a long period of time.
No. I don't know what your boyfriend is talking about!
That's the dream of the pharmaceutical industry.
Gaaaaaay
Is your friend Noiz? And are you giving him a BJ? That would explain a lot....

Cut a hole in a honey dew melon. Fxck it Cut a cucumber in half, remove the insides on one piece with a spoon and be careful not to tear the skin. Fxck it Open a banana and remove the inside filling. Wrap the banana around your dong. Fxck it Lie down on your bed. Fxck it Put a carrot up your bum. Toss your penis at same time. Interesting feeling.
You don't want creative. You want safe, tried and true ways. Then again if you really want to risk your life for a thrill, then take up snake milking or such.
Try asking a woman
Jackinworld.com has plenty of ways
Try switching hands or use lube.
I used a massager like this: http://www.amazon.com/Shiatsu-Neck-Back-Massager-Pillow/dp/B00UW8563G?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s02 on sore arms, and when I woke up this morning, my arms hurt so bad and they feel like jello. Do you think I damaged the muscle, or something worse? I read about a person once who messed up their neck vein with one of these...
I'm thinking responsible use is not to sleep with this thing turned on. I am just saying, you may not realize when harm is occurring if you use it while you sleep. Your husband could be correct if you left it on while you sleep - when your muscles naturally relax without help from something like this. Hope you get everything worked out.
So I have been having lots of unprotected sex with prostitutes and people from the Internet. I went to go take a piss today and my left testicle I noticed had turned gray the skin on that side and it feels like a stone :( And also when I pee orange color comes out and I've been having very bad breathing problems when I pee or just standing. I'm only 15 and I noticed to that pelvis area has been turning a light green gray color :( Please help I can't tell my parents what should I do!!?
See, you have done a mistake and now you are suffering from it. Now get tested and then forget about what has happened, learn from the mistake and don't do it again, because you have to suffer like now again (Not even with a condom). Have one trusted partner for sex even it may take time to find a one
Go to a doctor. Nobody could possibly diagnose you over the internet. Also, stop trolling.
See a Doctor - QUICKLY!
What a retard.Unprotected sex with a whöre.You might as well go with a fudge packer.
Troller or real I can't tell?.!!!
Try Pharrell Williams
I would suggest checking out the bands Mother Mother, Poe, The Mountain Goats, and Sia. Some relevant quotes from songs by these folk: Mother Mother "I have god awful shitty feeling of dread in my heart..." Poe "...a terrible thought can have a terribly long career..." The Mountain Goats - "...I'm going to make it through this year if it kills me..." Sia- "...I want to live like tomorrow doesn't exist..." There are better quotes, I'm sure, but that's what comes to mind off the top of my head.

This is very serious. I'm not being unduly negative but the detectable mets are in your liver. It's possible there are others not yet big enough to detect. A lot of this depends on the response of your tumours to the treatment. You'll know much more in a few months. Stick with the treatment. Good luck.
Ibrance plus femara or faslodex is proving to be an excellent first line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. Different people have different reactions, but the most common side effects of Ibrance itself is neutropenia (low white cell count) and fatigue. Side effects from femara or faslodex include bone pain and joint point. Your oncologist should have given you information on this treatment plan. If you feel that you don't know what to expect, you can also look up http://www.ibrance.com for the history and reported successes of the drug.
Ask for a treatment that's more up to date. They started using chemo in the 1930s and radiation in the 1960s. And they both can trigger the growth of additional cancers.
i think you should help to doctors about this matter.
Avoid anything with sugar! Pretty much any store bought food contains sugar so try to eat fresh, rice and vegetables is what I survived on for a month and lost so much weight! Lift weights it burns fat quicker! Do at least one hour walking everyday at a brisk pace, keep calories to under 1300 everyday. Try to only drink water and drink lots of it, you will lose a lot of water weight in the beginning by drinking more! Work out as much as possible, if your not sweating when working out your not working hard enough. You can do it!
That is impossible to lose 20 pounds in a little over 2 weeks! You can start my exercising, and eating right. Watch your calories. stay away from alcohol, any sweet drinks! I am 123, and losing ONE pound is even hard for me!! :(
Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing. I can feel the difference since I've started, and I'm loving my results so far. My energy is through the roof, making my workouts more fun and productive. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to increase their energy and better workouts .
Cut off an appendage. Seriously. You cannot lose 20lbs in a few weeks.
You can't lose that much weight in that short amount of time, and you'd be foolish to try. Your health is more important than anything else.
Do the dallas buyers club diet of Matthew whathisname. He lost so much weight. Thats what i did for a holiday once
You have an exact weight and not an exact time frame. Two weeks, four weeks, six weeks.
you can do it exercise or run, both are very helpful for lose weight

There is a great deal of subjectivity in being examined by a psychiatrist. Two psychiatrists examining the same patient are likely to come up with different diagnoses. Also, there is about a 90% chance that you will be prescribed a drug if you do see a psychiatrist. These drugs may be helpful in the short-term, but in the long-term, most pharmaceuticals slow down a person's recovery. The most helpful treatment is called "talk therapy" conducted by a psychotherapist. Mental health is not a pass fail category. My recommendation is that you also look into books by Anthony De Mello for a new perspective on your priorities and your life.
Skeptic brings a valid point, two people will have different opinions. Skeptic probably doesn't understand what psychiatry really is. A psychiatrist will try to come up with the best treatment. OFTEN that treatment IS or includes psychotherapy conducted by a psychologist. A psychiatrist is a physician and is covered by insurance or public health. Most insurance companies will cover psychotherapy IF a psychiatrist prescribes it. Get your doctor to refer you to a psychiatrist. Most insurance won't pay for 2 psychiatrists, so a second one will be out of pocket. Most specialty doctors cost around $400 for a consult.
The above 2 posts are correct.In the U.K there are Health care professionals paid for by the D.W.P to access peoples rights to welfare benefits.These people have no medical background and merely use a computer in a tick box exercise.

That smell is caused by the blood and air meeting. There is really no way to prevent it. There are scented pads you can buy, but some people get irritated by them. You could also try using a menstrual cup.
I was about to suggest the Diva Cup (menstrual cup). The lack of fabric may prevent the smell. If the smell is coming from blood and air meeting a tampon and scented panty liner should fix the problem!
sounds like an orgasm too me
Sounds like it. If there was a feeling of release, like if you really had to per and were finally able to go. Or like after you sneeze.

It is fine to have the bagel and cream cheese. We really don't have to question every morsel we eat all the time. Anything in moderation is good. The bagel is not perfect, but it is healthy - whole grains. And the cream cheese is fine too - a gram of protein and some carbs in addition to the fat.
it's not the healthiest but it's not bad to have once in awhile if you wanted to go on a no carb diet it's carbs
is your poops stinky?
I wasn't aware that society does. Men sometimes seem to. Perhaps because it is generally a slow growing cancer that can often be left untreated for 10 years after diagnosis? Perhaps because most men with prostate cancer die of something else age related (heart, stroke etc) before their psostate cancer needs treating? Perhaps because most younger men talk about prostate cancer testing with childish sniggers? Perhaps because men, generally, are less interested in health issues and less inclined to talk about health issues than women? The only way for it to get a more public profile is for men to talk about it openly.
I don't know what society you live in, but prostate cancer is very well known in my world.
Perhaps you've missed the publicity about it, the huge amounts of research in the disease, the excellent diagnostics and treatments.
They don't. It's simply that it's not as well 'advertised' ['advertized', if you are, in fact, one of my American cousins] as much as other forms of cancer.
Because, it is too busy with money spinning techniques.
grow a pair of balls and go to her and say "mom, I think I might want to try tampons." Explain to her that you know how they are used and that you promise to always change it every 4 hours so that you don't get toxic shock syndrome and lose a leg or possibly die.
Go buy your own, why does mommy have to get them? All of my daughters had to go and buy their own from the start, its no big deal.
Hmmmm, buy your own? If your mom has an objection, then you can do that.

Write a list of the positives in your life. There are some out there. Keep adding to the list as you think of more. This will get you to start thinking of you and your life in a better light.
What makes you think that guys don't buy menstrual products? I've never known a guy not buy menstrual products, overall women seem to have more of a problem with buying menstrual products than guys. The fact you suggest it's something nice that wins men brownie points, and that men don't have to worry about people thinking it was for them, shows you think buying these products is negative.
My husband has no problem buying me things like this. It's not a big deal.
Most do when they go shopping for their family. I didn't think that many men had a problem with it? Unless they're 12 years old?
it's embarrassing, especially when the gut gets to the checkout and the clerk announces over the store's PA system - " price check for tampons, 18 count, heavy duty" !!!!
I always found the old saying that "men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses" to be completely wrong. Most guys I know do not find glasses as even slightly a turn off. Like anything else you wear, you need to select the glasses that you think make you look best but you should not let wearing glasses affect your confidence.
Your prescription always changes really isn't an excuse. You can get small quantities at a time. 2 Boxes of monthly lenses last 6 months. Your vision wouldn't change so much in 6 months that they wouldn't be wearable after 4 or 5 months. If someone told you , you can't get contacts because your vision changes often, they have no clue what they are talking about.
Be a pretty person without glasses. If you're pretty, putting on glasses isn't going to change that.
I completely get how you feel. I am in middle school and I have had glasses since I was three years old and I always think of myself as "not pretty" in them but I just recently got contacts.Go to the store to get a new pair of glasses. Just do it. As long as you like them, it's all that matters. Find a pair that you like, I'm sure it won't be difficult
You need to find the perfect glasses. Make shopping for glasses like a hunt! Try to find something that fits you and looks good and embrace it! In the beginning i was really insecure when i wore my glasses but then i just built up my confidence and i wore them and i honestly feel like a look better with glasses on.
Glasses are like a hairstyle. What suits one person may certainly not suit another. You need to shop for glasses with a trusted friend who has a good sense of fashion.
Ye
That sounds like contact lenses would be a good solution,
Get sexy glasses.
just put your energies into something more productive.. believe me.. if you do somehow manage to have sex as a kid, its not going to be all fireworks and glory like hollywood makes it out to be.. You wont be a better person for having it.. you'll look into the mirror and the same immature person will be staring back at you as the day before.. Just wait.. its not going to fullfill your life to have been broken a virgin..
Start doing the things necessary to prepare yourself for a life in which sex is a part of your life. As a woman, that means getting ready to be a mother. That is what sex is intended to eventuate in. You exist today because your mother had sex and then took care of you. Now if you want God's help in this and every area of your life, you must come to God through faith in Jesus Christ: http://billygraham.org/story/how-to-be-b... http://www.iamsecond.com/seconds/moriah-...

Don't.
Don't have sex, that's what you do.

That is quite normal, most guys shoot out 2 or 3 big bursts and then a few tiny final shots, and are generally done in 10-15 seconds. Just look up guys ejaculating on line since you are 21 and you'll see you are quite normal.
I'm not a guy but if it continues to shoot out for 10-15 seconds long I think that's about normal
You are probably really into it, i guess it depends on how stimulated are you and how long the duration of your last one, i admit i can shoot a two or three c.um in one session but i cant do it in seconds without the help of porn. 18yo btw.
yes it's normal for your age
what? do you mean after 10-15 seconds you ejaculate?
An inch above average adult size, dude, so it is good size.
Either is great. But an inch is showing and you're 6 inches? You must have pretty small hands
Thats a pretty awesome hands, mines only 5inches so i can only wrap my one hand and the other holding and massaging my ballsx.
Depends how big your hands. Incidently, it's meant to fit a vagina. < M
Atheists tend to be well educated and have higher than average socio-economic status. Prisoners tend to be less educated and poorer than the average American.
Some people claim to be Christian to try to get out early on parole. I know a guy that does prison ministry at maximum security prison (over 500+ prisoners), and only about 8 show up for Mass when they visit the prison. 8 out of 500. That's not "a lot of Christians". That is about 1.5% Christians. If the prison were really Christan why so few at Mass? The fact is, despite your claims, most of them are not Christian
Because there are church services and pastors/ministers in prisons.
Could it be that there are a few more in one group than there is in the other?
Can you please back your question with some facts? Show us something that says prison populations contain x number of jews, y number of muslims, z number of christians. Thanks
Many call themselves Christian, but Christ said that one day He will say, "I never knew you."
Christian scum have zero moral values. Atheists are civilized.

Are you a girl? ;)
yea but wtf why
You like hurting yourself because for some reason you do not love yourself. If you start loving yourself, you will not do this to yourself. Love yourself unconditionally, and you will be able to love others too, unconditionally. And, how do you love yourself? By taking good care of yourself, eating good healthy, nourishing food, getting good amount of sleep, studying wisely to secure a good successful future, reading good books, inspiring books, praying...... You can start by reading the book, " you can heal your life" by Louise Hay. Hope this helps.
That's weird.

what a load of crap go the **** beaten out of yourself and I bet you don't enjoy that. Have you ever had a fight?
The balls pull up tight when cold, horny or to get up out of the way during various activities for protection purposes. All normal.
And once i go to the bathroom it is back to the normal again ... It usually happens in the morning only
You probably have an erection, or your horny or its cold. Nothing to worry about.
Is it cold where you live?
Alright, then.
Perhaps you need a warm bath and a cup of strong coffee. I know I do after reading this - it was quite long.

Just so you know, if they were bigger then you would be insecure about something else. It's not what you have or don't have that makes you insecure, it is your frame of mind. You have to tell yourself that you're just fine the way you are and rock what you got. And yes, they may still grow.
Probably not, but my wife said her boobs grew more when she was 16-17. But in your case, your boobls are fine. Most guys don't care about boob size.
honestly there's a pretty good chance they won't grow much more, but small boobs can be good in some ways
have sex or masturbate alot to make them grow
see a doctor

Bad nutrition leads to lots of failures of various systems in the body. 'Mal' means 'bad'. Put together and you get 'malnutrition'. If the dairy products aren't fortified, there are no vitamins. Do you eat the RIGHT things? Most don't and require a multivitamin faily supplement. Nutrition covers a WIDE chemical field and the more varied your diet, the better chances of getting the right chemicals. If you can sum up your diet in a Y!A update, it is lacking, and therefore 'mal'. To the point, go to the doctor and get your blood tested. Believe me, malnutrition gets worse. This may be a snowflake on the crest of the tip of an iceberg. You don't want that iceberg.
Your friends are right. Possible low iron or vitamin B levels. Also could be low blood sugar so make sure you are eating properly.
bad nutrition, go and get a blood test

I was reluctant to purchase this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea , but after seeing the results, I can say that this has really improved my workout and allowed me to get cut and ripped. Highly recommended! This is the ONLY product that says what it does and actually does it .
No it is not. You just blew your exercise regime.
It depends how heavy you are
No
no
Yes, it's perfectly fine. Do it in the shower with a moisturizing soap.
DO IT! Don't worry about what other people think! If it makes you comfortable go for it!
You're a big boy now, you can figure that out on your own bro. But why in the hell would you want to?
go for it if it makes you happy
do what makes you feel comfortable

girl yes.......a guy, hmm
Gillian, you should know that popping your pimples isn't a good idea. Nevertheless, put a small amount of neosporin on it and cover it with a band-aid, replacing that band-aid periodically when it becomes wet and soft.
There is something called the "Triangle area" which is your nose and around your nose which you should not pop pimples. This area heals different then most areas of your face just for future reference.
At night i would clean it and put an antibiotic ointment like neosporin on it and then put a bandaid on it. I had to do that for a crazy bug bite on my face. It will help it heal faster.
No logical reason a male climax would reduce lifespan. Normal bodily function.
No orgasms are normal functions of the body.
Yes it does when you masterbate you're wasting your life force
I hope not.
lol no
Average rate for teens is daily, no reason to stop. Most guys continue as adults. Man's favorite hobby.
Huh..... why stop? All boys masturbate at least once a day. Thats normal. Always have, always will. There's nothing wrong with it, there's no harm that can happened.
im also 13 and i do it like 2 a day. every guy does is i.t it is better if u stop but no harm if you don't. eventually, you will grow out of it
No, there is no reason for you to stop masturbating. It is completely normal to masturbate, especially at your age.
Well this is normal. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
No No don't stop Do More!!
Enjoy it man no need to stop your doing nothing wrong , heck yeah it feels great!
once a day is fine
stop the porn.....it will ruin your sex life
Shower works great. Easy clean up.
Bathroom, shower, toilet, your bed... and just ejaculate into tissues when you're done, then dispose of them in the trash.
The shower's a classic.
the toilet
I used PanOxyl/10% BP since I was a teen for my acne. I had great skin and received compliments all the time. I got a cyst once every couple months, but that was fine. Recently, in my early 20's, I've been having frequent breakouts on my chin and cheeks. They are not responding to BP. Not really sure what to do as I thought BP was the strongest acne treatment I could use... Please help!
These will work. Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Bought this for my son about 2 weeks ago. He has cystic teen acne and blackheads. He has reported that he is having less breakouts and his skin seems "calmer" Not as red and inflamed . We are likely to repurchase this argan life Ultra Nourishing Argan Oil for him.
Excess buildup of money is commonly treated with acupuncture. Otherwise that picture is loaded with unsupported claims that can't be backup by evidence. But it sounds nice.
Fat wallets can be treated with acupuncture.. Makes the wallet get thinner and lose weight. They keep on adding new acupuncture points to the charts to push the price up. Scientific research has repeatedly concluded that sticking needles into people doesn't accomplish any of the marketed goals apart from fraudulently making money out of it.
all sorts of things, but treatment isn't health restoration. nothing, stimulation or inhibition, can restore energy balance better than nature does when it is simply liberated from interference. see an hio method chiropractor.
Many different conditions.. The Chinese have been using it for thousands of years , if it didn't help they wouldn't waste their time.
All treatment offers advertised are true.
It's probably not your mattress. I had the same thing happen to me when I was young and it turns out it was my period hurting my back. Please don't ruin your mattress. Parents aren't dumb. He will know you did it on purpose. Ask for a mattress pad or a sleep pillow instead. He will appreciate the compromise and you will keep his trust.
No need. Just get your doctor involved or tell your sports teacher at school that you have a bad back because of your bed. A smart teen would turn the mattress over and round so that the old foot end is the top end.
I'm emailing him now, if you ruin a perfectly good mattress expect to sleep on the floor until YOU can buy a new one.
Ask for a sheet of egg crate foam to put on it. It's not even expensive. Mattresses are expensive.
Sorry about the situation. I would say it hurts your back really bad before you destroy it. Put a pillow under your back to remove the pain in your lower back (assumed)
Slash it, or relieve your bowels on it a couple of times. I had to do both when I was in your situation.
turn it over? twist it round? (so the top is at the bottom, less ware on the bottom) i found that it was actually my bed that had warped/bent that was causing back pains.
Throw up on it or have a dog chew it
Tell your dad it is hurting you. He should show you some sympathy.
Poop on it. But then you'd better hope you get a new one...!
Yes, its called a hemoglobin A1C. It gives an average of your blood sugars over the past three months. Usually gives a pretty good idea if your diabetic. However, this is not the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes.
It's the definition of "instant" that's confusing. I just had a check up with my doctor about a week ago and they had a new kind of A1C blood test that entails only pricking my finger, results took less then 5 mins so while I was with my doctor we got the results back (and they were good!). To me, that's pretty "instant" because in the past I always had to go in and get blood drawn from my arm, then wait a week for the lab to test and send in their report.
Not exactly. A home A1c test kit is probably as close as you can get. It doesn't tell you directly if you have diabetes, but you can infer that you have diabetes if the results are above a certain threshold. The kits are available at many pharmacies.
Not really. If you have high blood sugar it's very likely you are diabetic, because diabetes is the major cause of high blood sugar. Blood sugar is a simple, cheap test today so it's used for screening. If your blood sugar is normal, you don't have diabetes, so that's good. If you do have high blood sugar, well it's most likely diabetes but there are several things that can cause high blood sugar, so a doctor wants to order a whole series of tests to rule out those other things. So there's a simple test to rule out diabetes, but not to diagnose it.
It can definitely help to increase the rate at which your body digests the food but I would not recommend any vigorous exercise after eating a large meal, but a good walk around the block can help your food digest more quickly and relieve after dinner bloating or discomfort from over eating
Yes. Walking after meals helps digestion. (It's best not to get up and go immediately after the meal though...Sit for about 10 minutes first.)
Yes, walking helps to stimulate digestion.
I know that someone can be forced into a mental hospital by a court order, but others go in voluntarily. How does one voluntarily check themselves into a mental hospital?? Are they free to leave whenever they want?? Do they need a doctor's recommendation?? Will checking yourself into a mental hospital look bad (future employment, adopting a child, etc)?? I'm not a danger to myself or others. I just have bad anxiety attacks, and lately they've been getting a lot worse. I think I just need a couple days away from it all.... a calming environment where I can collect my senses.
You go to one and you ask to be admitted. Then a psychiatrist will come talk to you and see if you really need to be admitted. In your case they will tell you to find a therapist and they will send you away. If you need a few days off then take a vacation... mental hospitals are not resorts so that people can get a few days away.
The small upper left corner of the nail looks yellowish and underneath it it seems as if all the skin was like torn up or something. and above that part there are two small yellowish bumps, they are kind of painful to touch. I searched stuff up online about it but none of the symptoms for anything match up. It will randomly throb and hurt really bad especially when I'm in the bath. I am about to try to put my toe in a mix of water and hydrogen peroxide to see if that helps. But please if someone has a solution or answer please tell me!
try soaking it in cool water and epson salts its probably an ingrown toenail would be a good idea to see a Podiatrist to get it checked out
No. Semen kind of "freezes" after some time, when it's wiped by a cloth. It could be visible for other people to see. If those people are smart enough, they could even tell that it is your mess
Then, everyone in your house sees your work. That's good.
Lmao yea it's OK
Er
NO it is not. What would you do with the curtain afterwards? Leave it there?
Not if you want to be invited back.
no.
No, I'd say it's quite average in terms of cup size. Band size of 34 is large, but then again it may be that you, like many women, are wearing a band that is too big and should actually be in a 32D, 30DD, or even 28E, which would be a small or medium ribcage, and all equivalent cup size to a 34C. Hope this helps.
I think C is perfect! Average too, sort of how 6 inches is average for a guys penis. Mine is just 4 inches, you might say equivalent to an A cup for a girl haha.
no C is the average cup size, neither big nor small.
If he is a jerk, yes... he'd probably most likely leak it. In fact, I'd just assume that he would. If for some reason you feel as if you must send this guy a pic, just make sure it doesn't include your face.
Sure he will share them. That is why you never send nude photos of yourself unless you disguise your face so no one can tel it is you. Because your nude photo may end up anywhere in days.
DONT SEND THEM AT ALL First off if you are under age it is highly illegal. Next guys usually brag and send them to friends or show them
It's not important kid. Go outside and play.
Firstly, I was just like you at age 21. I'm now 23, and I finally got up the courage to go to a Dr, and tell the exactly how I was feeling. My Dr proceeded to ask me some questions about how long/how often I felt depressed/anxious, and asked more questions. Then he prescribed me a medication to help. It took some trial and error, as most prescriptions do but luckily I found the right one that helps me. Looking back I wish I had just gone in to the Dr a LOT sooner, because who knows how much different my life could have been!!! Don't wait to start living a better life. There is no reason to suffer unnecessarily!
It seems like you have some bottled emotions. Sometimes when someone talks to me I cry and I'm like I didn't even know that I had these feelings inside of me. You need to make a step. Make progress. Maybe give yourself like challenges. Like one afternoon say I am going to the supermarket for a bottle of milk.
Like most things, beards come into and fade out of fashion. Right now... they seem to be the "in" thing. After some time, they will once again fade out of popularity.
Beards are normal and natural, used to be the norm until World War 1 when the military had everyone be clean shaven, and the safety razor was invented. Then WWII came along and so the beardless look stayed around for years and years. Now it is going away, and that's good. I was at a fast food place the other day at noon and over 50% of the guys had some type of facial hair. So the beard is winning.
Some men's beards are just plain ugly. Some men really go over the top with a beard, so much so that you can't really see their face or what they look like. (Neanderthal man look). Some men look older with a beard. We saw a guy on the TV news one night, and even my husband (who tends to wear whiskers only) commented on hiw scruffy he looked--like a homeless man desperately in need of s shave. It will be good too see that fad finally put to rest.
Yes it is. The hipster lumberjack. They wear small clothing as well. It looks silly to me. Most woman my age do not like beards on men.
I like beards. What's wrong with a neatly trimmed beard? How is this stupid? Men have facial hair, why not wear it? I don't get your distaste.
Fad. Remember soul patches in the late 90's? THAT was f!cking stupid.
Just the thing
It's a dumb fad right now
Its not important. Move on.

Are you kidding Susie Q. I have been overweight and did not care but easily lost 20 pounds in less than 2 months. It is seriously not that hard. The mental issues people put in to it may be the very reason why they will not lose anything. Or they must not truly believe in themself to think they can definitely do it?It's very easy for me so I don't get it unless they have a disease.
I am so glad I got to try this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product . At first I was not sure if it would work, but actually am surprised that it did! The first day I got the tea, I made myself a cup. it has a very pleasant flavor. No strange after taste or aroma. Just a very nice tasting tea .
Because they think that they have to give up all their favorite foods to do it. That is why they give up so fast, they are miserable. That is not true at all. There are so many foods they can eat, and still lose weight. I did, and I lost 20 pounds.
Losing weight is not the easiest thing in the world for many people. You sound very sheltered and arrogant to make such an absurd and presumptuous statement.
My play is today and I can't wear glasses onstage (the lights cause too much of a glare). I can do without them ok, but I would much rather wear contacts so I could actually see. I have a brand new set of contacts. I could get solution this evening (practicing all day today and performing tonight). I heard you needed to rinse a new pair before putting them on. Could I just put then on without rinsing them then rinse them tonight? Could I make my own temporary salt water solution?
They don't need to be rinsed out of the package , they are ready to wear. Just put them on. There is NOTHING you can make at home to replace sterile solution. Water for 1 day is NOT fine. Boiled water and salt is NOT fine either. Certainly NOT EYEDROPS.
Eyedrops
Soft lenses? Sterile saline--which is just water that's been boiled and salt.
Does sound like lactose problems or at the worst celiac disease but not cancer so stop stressing as that can make your problem worse, Good Luck
I was once in your shoes when I was 19. I was scared to death that I had colon cancer. Once I had my colonoscopy, turns out I only had Ulcerative Proctitis. Good luck and I'll be praying for you!
Good Golly Miss Mollie, What did worrying ever get you in life? (For me, a whole lot of regrets). Just Saying...
Believe your doctor.

Just one of the unpleasant effects of smoking. After a while you'll spend the first few minutes after waking up in the morning coughing up phlegm.
Phlegm is your body trying to protect itself and remove irritants.
You are inhaling chemicals...Your body is trying to rid you of them.
ewww, lol.
No what would a 34 year old woman have in common with a 13 year old boy?
Depends on what her intentions are and how well they already know each other. If they literally just met, and she is not working as a costumed character of some sort, the yes, it's not any mor right than if a man were to do it.
Nope.
Maybe if she is wearing a Barney costume
No, it's not ok.
f*ck off, @$$hole
how is dropping out going to help you in any way?
Hi there! I’m sorry you’re going through so much. Do you think it might be helpful if you speak to your parents or a trusted adult about your struggles? Have you considered counseling for your situation? I’ll be praying for you that God will provide the wisdom, strength and guidance you need at this time. Hang in there!
Almost every human has sexual needs, so religions exploit those needs by making strict rules around them to control people with guilt. It happens with other needs like food too (look at all the food laws in the Old Testament and in other religions), but controlling people with sexual guilt is nearly universal in religion.
It's not necessarily seen as a bad thing in all cases by all Christians. And there are plenty of non-Christians who see it as potentially a bad thing in some cases. The pros and cons are pretty obvious. It carries the possibility of unwanted pregnancy. It carries the possibility of sexual exploitation of one person by the other. And so on. On the other hand, it can be an expression of genuine love; it can lead to a deeper relationship; or can let two people learn that they aren't compatible before they commit more deeply.
It's not. Not by the christian women I've met.
Ahhh good question! Just make sure to leave lots of empty bags of food around and even crumble up some chips or something and leave crumbs EVERYWHERE. I say even go as far as to leave food wrappers in your pockets so your parents find them if they do your laundry and such. When they are not looking just smear food over your face it always worked for me.
You don't. You need to eat, if you starve yourself you can get extremely sick. Hospital visits, and EVERYTHING. You are no where near fat, you're a good weight for your age.
-Are You SURE You're not 9 ?! Cuz THAT's the Kind of Thing an Immature 9 year old- would Do. :o
What do i do to make my parers think i am not starving myself? (tips would be great like hoe much exercises to do and which type)
You are lucky they are taking the initiative to save your life. Stop fighting it and get help.
If you have to ask your guardian to take it away I would do that. I go through the same stuff and make a motive with constant alarms that tell you to get up to the point wear you get up and do something else and you can't turn it off until you get up or if your guardian heard it she can help you too. So if you have a motivation and others to get you up that's what I'd do.
Just stop. Put it down. You'll find something else to do. Quit being pitiful about it and just stop. Discipline.
Go outside with a camera. Make your own video. Feel better
I'm 25 years old and I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for close to 7 years. In Feb I was admitted to the hospital because I planned on killing myself. Since then I have been seeing a therapist and take medication. These things have helped a bit but I am so scared that I will never be happy. My biggest fear is that I'm going to be alone and depressed for the rest of my life.
Which meds are you on and for how long? Obviously you need something better. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
You are very young, you have all kinds of time to find someone to spend your life with. Believe in yourself, like yourself for who you are and you will be surprised what will happen. You don't have to please everyone, it's ok if people don't like you. Like yourself, and others will as well. Hang in there dude
hmmmm and you are on physcian prescribed medications. You could listen to high velocity cheerful music like youtube chipmunks versions of your preferred music play at at higher velocity, or ABBA sped up at the gear icon. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mKhM58l...
why is that so scary? im alone and depressed.. mostly because other people are more hellish than being alone is.. being alone is a great way to develop yourself. learn to love it.. its better than being around other stupid people who make you unhappy...
Good morning, All. I've recently discovered I have a cataract that requires surgery. I thought "no big deal", until I did a little reading. Is it true they actually remove the eye lens too? How risky is that. In addition, I'm near sighted currently and I read that I would need reading glasses after. Won't that be odd, one eye nearsighted and one eye not? Help!!!!!
A cataract is the lens of your eye that has turned cloudy. To remove the cataract, they remove the lens. Almost no risk. When they remove your lens, they can replace it with a lens of any power they choose. Most people choose good distance vision and wear glasses to read. If you are very myopic and it is going to be a long time before you need the other eye done, they may choose to make you a bit myopic in the eye that is operated on. It is not good for your eyes to be too different in refractive error.
You are best served by reviewing what is going on and talking w the doctor. Yes the eye lens, which is the problematic part is removed and replaced with a synthetic lens. A small cut is made in the side of the eye and an ultrasonic probe is inserted which shatters the lens and the lens fragments are removed in the process. The new lens has good intermediate and long distance vision but up close vision requires corrective lens glasses. Since you are getting one eye treated, the lens in the glasses for the other eye will be configured for that eye's needs. This is the typical solution in cases like yours.
The whole point of cataract surgery is to remove the lens which has become cloudy and is not transmitting light as it should. An artificial lens is inserted but this cannot move to accommodate different viewing distances as a natural lens does hence you need glasses. The glasses will also balance differences in vision between your eyes.
What the ****? DUMP HIM. There are guys out there that will find you sexually attractive, and unfortunately, this guy is not one of them. Seriously, leave. You should probably try to lose weight for your health though

If anything on earth worked it would be all over the news ad everyman on earth would have a three foot long dick
You can't make your penis bigger than it is genetically programmed to be. And since you didn't give your age, we have no way of knowing if your still growing. If you're 16 and over, then no. Your penis is the size it's going to be.
Why exactly do u want a bigger dick?? If it's to please a woman you're wasting your time you'll never hear a woman complaining about her vagina not being tight enough
Don't try to. Nature made you just the way you needed to be for the right woman. Erection size matters the most as well.
Take a picture of the dick , enlarge it , that is all .
Trim your pubes. You'll gain a few visible inches.

Obama's numbers aren't accurate. Like everything else the boy does, it's all a lie.
Bush needed them to cut the grass for the Texas Rangers.

Shake your body really fast then pop the top.

Same answer as titanic Wtf.
Absolutely yes! Your penis at 8 inches is huge and a very good size. The average penis is 5 to 6 inches so yours is a lot bigger than average. You should use "Magnum" condoms on your big penis.
Well, you should manage most positions in the Kama Sutra then. Girth will determine what size condom you need. Look through Trojan website or Durex. < M
I've been that size since 20, and I have used Durex Xlarge, Xlubed, and Xthin since 18, when I was 7.5 inches. Keep in mind, large circumference rules too. Some will tell your Trojan Magnums, but I found the collar band to cut into my flesh. Durex doesn't.
V . Good , large size condom
Pretty good size for anyone of whatever age , all u need is the standard regular condoms dude

I see colours sometimes when I close my eyes. I can be in a pitch black room, and suddenly I'll start to get a bleed of colour in my vision always starting from the outer corner of my right eye. It will then pass straight over my eye, spread to the other eye, and then slowly disappear. I've had it with both red and green now, I have flashes of blue occasionally too. The colours don't form any shapes as of yet, however I am curious as to what this is?
The red is blood in your eye. The green is the results of seeing red for too long, and the optic nerve starts picking up the "phantom" color that is the opposite primary color of red. You can do the same thing by staring at a wall that is red (or some other primary color), then after a couple of minutes, look at a blank white wall (or out the window at some clouds), and your eyes will "see" the opposite color of the primary color you were originally looking at. I believe this is called a "phantom" vision. But I may be getting that confused with something else.
Phosphenes.
You have an ability to see the different color in the dark and can see the things throught the wall, but you should find the king of shite first to unlock it, now you can only watch porn in the dark.
There is not just darkness. Emptiness produces substance.

oh no you and your silly question on a stupid subject..
well avoid some foods that cause too much wind eating cauliflower,spinach,beans ,tomotoes etc eating too hot foods steam has to get out some where. eating too fast and not chewing too well eat small portions but eat few times drink plenty water cut down on wheat products that will help after meals drink peppermint tea or Nettle Tea,Jasmin Tea. This will help Empty your bowls before going to bed
Figure out what your gas producing triggers are. Cabbage, beans, some other vegetables are famous for being fart producers. So likely something you are eating.
That's a new one , which I have never seen on here before , I think it depends on diet . I fart a lot myself . but I don't care who hears it . did you know , you can light a fart with a match .
decrease your intake of baked beans
look at what you eat

These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Washing your face helps but quiet frankly does very little to get rid of acne. If you wash your face too much you'll make your acne worse because you are tearing down your skin's acidic mantle which is what protects you from bacteria. Like it or not acne is hereditary and is part of who you are. If you want to get rid of your acne in the meantime, get bevoline, it will clear you up.
Acne development is highly correlated with the secretion of oil glands. People with actvie oil glands get acne easily because skin pores are easy to be clogged by oil or dirt. Oily food can increase the chance of the blockage of pores by oil. But the secretion of oil glands is not affected by water, banana, or oranges. It is genetically controlled by hormones. Cleaning seems to be an effective way to prevent pores to be clogged. A cleanser like Chlorella Gel Cleanser that can absorb oil or dirt out of pores can remove acne quickly.

Try pulling down your bottom eyelid ( your cheeks, like making a funny face) and rolling your eyes back and blinking. They might fall out. Hope that helps
Why on Earth would you want to take out your eye? I can't imagine someone wanting to take their eye out. It is attached by muscles and optic nerves and it would probably make you blind in that eye. Please talk to someone about this desire before you take your eye out.
Do any of your friends wear contacts? If so, call them and ask for help. Or, you could call a pharmacist. I'm sure they could help you.
Try YouTube . They have self help videos on everything
get someone to help you take them out
It doesn't matter really. All scientific studies show that there is no effect of untainted Ayurvedic medicines. As 20% of those sold contain toxic levels of heavy metals you should consider doing something less unethical than this. All degrees are equally worthless.
Ayurveda is a belief system. It's something that you learn, nothing really to study. Treatments that use superstition, incantations, amulets, spells, and mantras. No school grants such a degree in the United States and if you want to practice Ayurveda you do so as a practitioner of "alternative".
yes.you may contact Dr.P'Venugoapalreddy on ph.no.919963726572, an ayurveda karma yogi, who trained 1000 youth in telangana state & arranged self-employment right @ their place .
In another country, but not in the U.S. Because the pharmaceutical companies control medicine here, your options here are limited to drugs and surgery.
sounds fantastic....I never looked, but a search shoul pop up a few.....good luck
No I wouldn't worry about the flash.
Why does this question even need to be asked? No.
You're right -- it does sound far-fetched.
No
no it doesn't
really?
I have a very strong prescription and I wear contact lenses 90% of the time. I have a pair of designer glasses for the days when I don't feel like wearing contacts but I'm looking to get a pair of very basic glasses for when I'm doing things like shaving my legs in the shower. I don't want to spend a lot of money on these glasses so I requested the most basic lenses without any AR coating or other add-ons.
I enjoy large frames and picked out a pair but the optician said that it would be "impossible" to fit my prescription in those frames with the basic CR-39 lenses. I told her that I don't care about thickness or weight. These are just for me to wear at home for an hour or so but she said that it simply couldn't be done. I think she's just trying to make me spend more money than I want to. Am I right? The rx is currently: R -7.75 L -9.25
I have a similar prescription and Target once told me frames I had picked out could not accommodate the lenses I needed. It's not the optician who is refusing to fit the lenses (he doesn't give a $%&^&*) but the specification of the prescription versus the parameters of the frams.
It's very possible she is correct. The lenses could be so thick in a large frame they will push up against your face and not even allow the frame to sit on your nose. There ARE technical limitations with large frames and strong prescriptions. We don't know the frame size chosen or your PD which are important factors she has the advantage of knowing. If you don't want better lenses then at least greatly reduce the frame size so they will be wearable.
The optician went to school for several years, to study these things, she/he should know what they are talking about. If these are supposed to be cheap low-quality lenses, then you should be able to find cheap smaller frames that accommodate your prescription too. What difference does it make to you, what shape they are, if they are only used at home?
Like Footprintz said.
yes
Infact, yes. It is contracted when you look up "meatspin.com" while eating monkey.

Please beware of the STDs before you become an escort, especially INCURABLE very common HERPES (HSV2), Every 1 out of 6 People have it, since as an escort you will have sex with so many you are most likely to get it and this virus can be contracted even if your client wears a condom Search the net for herpes and you will find the details Please do not ruin your entire life, It's not worth it. Have one trusted partner for sex even it may take time to find a one
If she doesn't want HIV, yes. Statistically your kind is the most likely to have it both in the US and in the world. What do you call a ****** without a jailhouse shank? A virgin baahahahaha. You have to actually pay for it? I thought all the women can't keep their hands off your people? Thought you brothas all had 12 inches? Ohhh no did it turn out that's bullshit?Only losers see escorts. Nice to know my tax dollars goes into you paying for hookers with your gibs. Go to the gym, lose some weight pay your taxes and get off welfare
This has been going on for 4 years. I get laughed at,called names,made fun of and sometimes even pushed every day.i have been in counselling for 4 years been forced in girls groups told teacher parents principals etc. And it dosent work I have been thinking about it every day it gave me depression I can't switch schools and I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO please help and I can't ignore it it gets worse
My Brother is 16 and he kinda doesn't care about life , he's like smoking kills so what so does the fumes from cars, the sun, car crashes,getting hit by a car, drowning,choking,plane crashing, there's murderers out there , u can smoke and not get cancer and not smoke and still get cancer so smoking makes me happy and with everything in the world that can kill me , I'll probly die from something else then this
Yeah he is correct, he probably will die from something else, like my Aunt, who is a life time smoker, and now has emphysema. Not a fun disease derived from cigarettes. I hope he is prepared for that. It's going to be a long painful road ahead.
No idea where you live that a hospital would close just because it is Sunday. Hospitals here are always open. Our hospitals are open at any time of the day or night, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Minor Injuries/Minor Illness Units are open Sundays here, it's not just the Emergency Departments that open on Sundays.
Not sure where you live, but I've never heard of hospitals not being open on Sundays.
Hospital's specialist clinics don't open on weekends but i am sure that the accident & emergency room is.
They are open 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, so have you been sleeping under a rock?
what?? i'm not at all sure i understand your question...and i'm also not sure what kind of hospitals you've seen.
No, masturbation is a part of human sexuality. Guys need to be ready at any time for sex because women can only have babies at certain times of the month.(about a week) Because all women are different and would have different times that they can have a baby, we are programmed to want sex all through the month. And because we are "civilized" we cannot just jump on any girl when we need sex, so guys masturbate. We need the sexual relief and if we enjoy recreational sex, it helps last longer. Masturbation is not a bad thing, it is a necessary part of our sexuality.
Nah dude
99.99 percent of all boys masturbate. Always have since beginning humanity, and always will.
No it is quite pleasurable. It can make you look like this.
No masturbating is normal, natural, healthy and safe.
no its not bad, its something very normal and common
No its natural
only if mom or sis catches you doing it
not at all
I had a small bump on my penis for a couple of months that only recently became large, red, tender, and puss filled. I tried to not mess with it as much as I could, but I was showering tonight and it happened to pop. I squeezed the rest of the white cheesy fluid out and let water run over it. Then I applied some antibiotic cream all over my penis and slapped a band-aid over it. What is going to happen???
When a cyst pops, this indicates the infection is being released so keep an eye on the area, watch out for any further redness or tenderness, and consult your GP for a full physical check.
If I had to guess, this was a lone cyst, not some STD. But I guess you just let it heal.
Apparently = yes. Don't smarm antibiotics all over penis. You need those friendly bacteria. A TINY dob and a Band-aid is quite enough. < M
Unless you see a physician and get proper treatment, the infection will spread and it will rot and fall off.
If your stool isn't black, you aren't bleeding internally. Most likely coming from somewhere in the lower digestive tract. I'd go see a doctor. They'll be able to tell you what's going on.
1. If it [blood in stools] continues for another week or two, then you may think of it. 2. Lest, prudent to take it easy and forget.
See a doctor and get it checked. Could be a food intollerance or IBS
Ok i think this happened to me before. You have to go to your family doctor and they will send you to a specialist
1 time means nothing.
if it's bright red, it's probably hemorrhoids
Find out why.
Yes, I'd consider that underweight. I'm 5'2, and about 105 pounds, and I am on the low end of a healthy weight. You should be at least 105 pounds to be a healthy weight.
Yes, that is much too thin. You are probably about 25 pounds underweight, maybe more.
Yes
That would give you a body mass index (BMI) of 16.2, which is considered to be underweight. If you weighed about 105, you would reach a body mass index of 18.6, which would make it into the 'normal' BMI category. I am your height and weigh 114, and my BMI is still within the 'normal' range.
Unless you are very small boned, it is underweight.
Little boys learn pretty quick and then as they get closer to 12 and 13 learn even more. Boys don't really need to 'learn' how to masturbate. It's almost an instinct.
No body teaches, no tuition classes for masturbation. Everybody learns automatically. Similarly no one teaches how to do intercourse. Regards.
I learned from trial and error, really. I used to spend 2 hours trying to figure it out.
It's instinctive to know how to masturbate, you don't need to be taught.
I learned from my cousin, would always walk in on him jerking it time after time an decide to do it to an boom
They get horny so they masturbate. Your troll attempt was nice but you gotta try harder
I found out from google.
Depends on social culture. < M
Yes , always one from other. It is a universal truth
I found out by accident and I loved it.
I know women have different preferences and the most important thing is how I use my penis, but I just want some honest opinions on my size. My age is 21 years old ( i m definitely done growing lol ) I ll give all 3 measurements ( Girth, Length, width ) my penis length is 6.5 inches, my girth is 5.1 inches, and my width is 2 inches. Thank you ladies!
Most girls have no concept of size, dude-- they think their boyfriend who is 5 inches is HUGE when he is just average. Here are the facts: Average is fact 5.16 inches long, girth average is 4.59 inches. No data on "width" since that is part of girth. At 6.5 inches you are in the top 10% of all males in terms of penis size. Sure some are 8 or even 9 inches but those are quite rare. Most larger guys are between 6 and 7 inches.
It's good for most women. Not the best, but ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
That sounds like the perfect size.
According to scientists, 5in is the minimum to please a woman. The more long you have, the more excite they'll be. Having long penis doesn't pleasure more.
I'm gonna need the metric conversion on that. And I know you have the time...
SEX IS RAPE. don't listen to what men say!!!!!
Well the idea of a ******** is to trap blood in the penis. Blood goes in however doesn't go out which helps you maintain a harder firmer erection.
They are used to help maintain an erection as well as making that erection firmer and to help delay ejaculation. If you are unfamiliar with using them I would suggest that you get an adjustable one or one that is stretchy. If you experience any pain or discomfort it should be removed immediately.
You can get them now at Walmart by the condoms- a disposable one. Try it and see.
Yeah it's supposed to help you maintain.
it is where roosters are kept
People say it helped them. I know looking ouT in th the horizon everyday and focusing at far distances (for myopia) helps. People who have actually done it have said it works. I'm personally to lazy and uncommitted to try, bu but despite what these so called Yahoo professionals say, I think you should try it out urself.
No. Exercises are for muscles. Your eyes don't use muscles to see and focus, so eye exercises are pointless.
I have never me anyone who had success with it.
nope
The Liz Earle range aren't bad. But you could simply apply a little organic almond oil or coconut oil, as these are often used as a base in many products you will spends a small fortune on.
Origins makes great skin care products. I use "Never a Dull Moment" face cleaner and don't need a moisturizer. AXE body wash, same thing.
Nivea
Do not apply face powder, often wash with cold water( if weather is cold use Luke warm water) There is no need of spending money for buying moisturizers. Regards.
Honey is a natural moisture instead of expensive products.

It is impossible to say. If you are seeing 20/40 because you have a corneal abrasion, it will heal in a day or two and you will see better. If you are seeing 20/40 because you have a cataract, you can have surgery. If you are seeing 20/40 because you are myopic, you can wear glasses or contacts. If you are seeing 20/40 because of macular degeneration, you probably can't be helped.
It depends what is making your vision 20/40 If you are just a bit nearsighted, you can wear glasses or contacts to see 20/20 There is no permanent fix. It is probably too mild for surgery also.

Many times, laser surgery can correct eyes. Talk with your eye doctor about this.
I don't know. I feel much the same way. don't kill yourself though. it could be worse. I was riding the bus into work today to my sucky job and there was this song on the radio about hanging on, waiting to find love and peace. said that it didn't feel possible now but to wait for it... it was kind of sappy but it made me feel a little better.
self pity is not a mental illness. join clubs that interest you , get a mental health counsellor , YOU MUST take the first step . take your medication each day , get out & about , there is always someone to chat too no matter where you go , the park , shopping malls ,bus stations , cafes , etc, enrol for college .
This is what is called "FATE". Nothing else. You should not over think about it now if you are really mentally upset. Procrastinate everything. Eat well and take compete rest.
i used to suffer from depression just like you are feeling now my friend please don't have any intentions about harming yourself there are people that care about you and would be heartbroken if you hurt yourself or managed to commit suicide . my friends told me to start doing something productive when i started feeling worthless as you are now
I don't know what's going on with you, but I can assure you that it can always be worse. appreciate, what you do have and remain optimistic.
i feel you. everyday is a struggle
They are primarily harmful to your wallet since there is no drug, device or exercise that can permanently and safely increase the size of your penis. Unless purchased from a known and reliable Chinese supplier there is no telling what the pills may contain and so they may include harmful substances. Only if they have proven Food and Drugs Agency approval should you take them.
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pills, I've noticed significant results . It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
Does they what? Certainly no male enhancement pills are real, in that they actually work, so none are safe.
They certainly do not work as advertised.
I don t want my family to find out i masturbate, but i wanted something to do anal with during masturbation. I found an old rusted metal rod which had a hole in it and was open. I cleaned it up with soap on the outside but couldn t reach its insides, which i washed with water only. I used it a bit for anal.... now i am worried if it could be harmful to me...should i continue using it or can it be harmful?
Not a good idea, if rough can tear the delicate tissue back in there. I'd suggest looking around for something else to play with.
What you are doing is very dangerous, you should never insert anything into your anus, least of all a rusty metal rod
get a tetnus shot
Yes. < M
Not only do you smell sweat, but the pheromones that are released during sex. Also, semen and vaginal lubrication have a distinct smell. So to do condoms and lube, if used. Put it all together and that's what sex smells like.
While sex does smell like sweat and genitals, this is a figure of speech. If a spouse came home smelling of sex, the other spouse would kick them out for cheating with someone else. Otherwise, the figure of speech refers to body language, speech and mannerisms.
Sex smells like sweat, vaginal secretions, and semen. Semen basically smells faintly bleach-y and faintly salty if you haven't encountered any yet. It's not always all *that* smelly, but if a couple goes at it pretty hard they are going to be a bit funky until they've showered afterwards.
sex smells like sex., it is not a smell that can be mistaken for anything else
You will know when you have sex.
anal or vaginal ?
This may seem stupid but i have anxiety, ocd and depression. I'm scared of death, i get intrusive thoughts of my loved ones dying and sometimes the word die would be in my head towards them even though i wouldn't wish it upon them. I blacked out because of a panic attack and woke up thinking I was dying. I'm just scared of death, I have to do certain rituals to make myself feel better. It's so distressing i don't know how to get rid of it.
The odds of you not waking up are low. Most of the things that could cause you to die in your sleep aren't related to you being asleep. Things like heart attacks could actually be more likely if there is a lot of stress on your heart, from exercise for example.
im 13 i had my exams today of which i had a panic attack and fainted i suffer with server depression so i know what is like to be afraid stay strong x
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online. it sounds liek an anx ocd peob i have similar thins rarely.

Well, if it was your intent to kill yourself, it counts as a suicide attempt. No matter what your intent was, seems clear you are in need of professional help
Sounds like a bit of an attention seeking stunt. Much like asking such question on a public forum. If you're really that worried, seek help from a professional!
It doesn't have to. It was self-harming. If you are seeing someone now that is good hope you are feeling happier today. Try the jokes and riddles section like I used to if you want to cheer up a little.
naw, boobs don't weigh no 20 pounds, that's ridiculous....more like a cpl lbs
if they weigh 20 pounds each than their massive
Big ones weigh more. Yours are up there.
Yes, they hold a lot of weight.
I am 19 years old and live in Florida. I am considering to be become a personal fitness trainer and eventually open up a gym down the line. Want to know if I need to be certified? Do I need to go to college for this? Is there anything I need to know before taking this on? If possible, please provide links or websites for me to do more research on this. Thank you kindly!!
You don't need a college education to open a business. However, a business degree would teach you how to BETTER run a business. A business' success hinges upon having business contacts. Contacts matter more than education. If you had a degree in kinesiology, you'd be a much more DESIRABLE personal trainer, but still not necessary. College is worth something if you have a goal. It sounds like you do. Even a two year degree would make you more desirable But college only benefits those who make use of it.
No college required, but it is recommended. To get certified by the NSCA you need a 4 year degree. It all depends how credible and respected you want to be.
Do you burn calories?** Yes, you do. You burn calories doing anything. The more you burn, the more weight you lose, but it is an effortful endeavor.
Depends on what you eat. It certainly burns calories.
Yes if you do it for awhile everyday
sure you do as your exercising
Its likely not broken. I would take ibprophen and tylenol and ace wrap your hand for support. If it continues to bother you a few days after that then go to your Primary Care Physician
than see a doctor

im 19 soo for almost a month ive been having pain in my Lungs and sone difficulty breathing. ive also been feeling weak. and not hungry.. my doctor told me a month ago it might just be a small lung infection.......but im soo paranoid that it might be cancer, Could I have Cancer or is it in my head??? The pain did stop a while ago but came back on Thursday
Aww, sweetheart, no you don t have cancer! Pain in that area can be caused by an inflammation of the lung lining, from a mild pneumonia, etc. You DON T have lung cancer. That s not how you d notice it, honest. Also you might want to look at the possibility of mono. But please do go back to the doctor! You may need antibiotics, etc. Big hugs! You re okay. Just some kind of infection.
You COULD have cancer. But then, I COULD have cancer too, but I'm pretty sure the way I feel right now has something to do with how late I was up last night and how much I drank. The only way to tell is to go to your doctor. Nobody on here can tell you.
Highly unlikely but perhaps ask the doctor for a chest x-ray for peace of mind. I know this can be scary and it's easy to worry about this stuff but please try to realize that cancer is very rarely the cause of these symptoms, especially at your age. I really would ask for that x-ray though given how long the symptoms have lasted because it could be something else that needs further treatment.
Highly doubt it. It all begins with a cough of blood or severe symptoms. If the doctor diagnosed you with a lung infection. Then its a lung infection. Since your young you'll get by it quick. Canceemr just doesn't strike that fast on day one.
Lung cancer at your age, statistically speaking, would be very unlikely. Not saying that it's not possible, but you would be a rare case if it did happen.
why would you NOT believe the doctor - it's an infection. period. end of story. - go back to him. did you stop taking the medicine he gave you before the medicine actually ran out? if you did, that's why it came back - ALWAYS take ALL medicine until it's gone, no matter how good you think you feel
Get a chest X-ray for heaven's sake, and whatever other tests the doctor recommends.
You don't have lung cancer..
Bed bugs will show up even on new beds if you have an infestation, it has nothing to do with old beds. You are probably thinking of dust mites, which are microscopic and EVERYWHERE, not much you can do about them except to get your furniture professionally cleaned. Anyway, it's recommended you replace your bed every 6-10 years I replace mine every 6 years if it's a really good bed, if not, I replace it every 1 to 2 years.
Look for visible signs of wear and tear on your mattress. If your mattress looks tired, sagging, lumpy, dented or worn, it is time to retire it. If your mattress is 7 years or older, a new mattress will likely improve your sleep.
maximum of every 7 years

Whilst it's rare to be that big at 14, it does obviously happen. It seems that guys who are well hung are teased just as much as those who are late developers, which is unfortunate, but if that happens to you, you either laugh it off, make a joke about having a tent pole, or ignore the comments. It's almost always driven by jealousy.
Most are about 4 inches at 14.
Most guys reach full adult size down there by 14 to 15 and while 7 inches is quite large- top 5%, it is probably normal for you based on your genetics. In other words, dad and your granddad are probably well hung too.
Nope

Nausea*— (feeling as if one would vomit) 1 pill of Ipec 6 or Rhus Tox 6, 3 or 4 times daily or cholera powder. Dosage*: 2 grains t.d.s. • All these biochemic salts/homeo medicines available @ local Homoeo shops, are safe and with side benefits. Don’t swallow medicine. The medicine to be dissolved on/under the tongue. Don’t take any thing 10 minutes before and 10 minutes after medication. You can take water.
I only had mild nausea. I found that there was a constant nasty taste in my mouth that triggered this and tainted the taste foods. Clean, sharp flavours cut through this. Ginger, mint, lemon were great for this and I also found capsicum and cucumber helpful. Everything I ate or drank included one of these things while I was going through chemo.
Personally, I find modern anti-nausea meds to work very well. I see no reason to avoid them, especially when they are used on a temporary basis. I chew on ginger and/or peppermint when I don't feel the nausea is strong enough for meds.
Ginger helps me. Or even ginger ale. I have some Gingermints and crystallized ginger, both have been helpful.
Weed works better than any prescription drug.

Most of us live in a toxic environment we are breathing in toxins 24/7 there is nothing we can do about it there is no point in trying to be clean why do people even bother. Alot of intelligent people dont question anything when it comes to anti smoking propaganda. Most of us are going to end up dying of cancer anyways why do people want to live long? I rather live a short life I enjoy than a long boring life.
Because it's terribly unhealthy, and this has been proven for half a century. I've been addicted to cigarettes for only 4 years and I already feel the unhealthy affects on my lungs and throat. That said, it is very good for treating anxiety and depression, which are the only benefits I've received from smoking.
It is unhealthy and it reeks. People who die from smoking may have their life's cut short but their death is sometimes long and agonizing. Two of my grandparents who were smokers died from COPD in their 60s. They were on oxygen for the last 2-3 years of their life. Imagine not being able to breathe or do anything without a machine doing it for you.
Because of the overwhelming evidence. Right, and adding to the total toxins is unhealthy. Most living things want to continue living to old age. There's nothing enjoyable about smoking tobacco.
Your question makes no sense. You say why do people say smoking is unhealthy, so I'm expecting you to go into how smoking is perfectly healthy. Then you end up with basically saying "well yeah it is unhealthy, but I don't care."
Your lungs simply aren't meant to take smoke in, only oxygen. Also take into consideration how much crap is put into cigs like rat poison, rocket fuel, toilet bowl cleaner, etc. Now I smoke American Spirit cigs which is 100% tobacco, no additives. While knowing that I'm not smoking the chemicals is nice, its still not healthy. It still is carcinogenic and has tar in it which in the short term will ruin your ability to do physical activity for as long and in the long term will blacken up your lungs which could cause lung cancer, emphysema, bronchitis, etc. This is just the tip of the ice berg though.
Only a rock wouldn't understand that smoking is unhealthy.
Except I've lost 80% of kidney function as a direct result of high blood pressure due to chronic smoking. Did I quit.? Don't ask
I mean if smoking does it for you then whatever, you do you. But the truth is there are definite, proved, serious health risks. Its a well known fact. And even though you might die of cancer that's not smoke related one day, smoking is definitely going to increase your chances super dramatically not to mention if you see what it does to your lungs, your voice, your teeth and basically your everything. Its pretty disgusting in my opinion.
Because its bad for a fetus which cause birth defects. Its sucks how they changed the smoking age, oh and im glad smoking is never going to stop and be banned. Now ill start when im 21.
One that size won't fit in most pants, should be sticking out the waistband on top. About an inch above adult average, and thicker than average as well. Would be a good find if you were searching for a well hung guy to play with.
No that's fine, mine is 6 inches with a 4.5 inch girth.
It's fuckedd up on how much pressure the media puts on us guys to have a bigger penis you're not gonna hear women complaining about how loose there vagina is I don't care I'm 4 inches and don't care! You can't change your penis size so either deal with it or kill yourself.... And yea 6 inches is long you're good
No, it is not disappointing at all. That is something wonderful to find in a guy's pants.
average length is about 5.5 inches and average girth is about 4.6 inches so its actually above average by about half an inch in both areas
it's ok. If there is nothing better... But so we can say the other way around - vaginas... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
No. I think it is a great size
I think 4.5 and under would be 'disappointing'.
Your fine.
nope, it is always a fun discovery
You need the prescription that was written by your eye dr. to get replacement lenses. Most optical shops will fill a prescrip. that is up to two years old. The shop where you last bought lenses should also have it on file.
If I know that for the right eye I used to be: SPHERE -0.50 CYL -0.25 AXIS 110 but now I know my sphere is 0.75 is there anyway I can make an estimate as to what my CYL/AXIS will be?
No. You need to have all of the numbers for each lens; you cannot just guess or "estimate". Your eye doctor can give you, or the optical shop, a copy of your prescription, assuming it hasn't expired.
You should have a current full prescription. Your left eye has sph/cyl/acis. It is possible that for your right eye, there is sphere, and no cyl/axis. (This would mean that your right eye has no astigmatism.)
YES go to your eye doctor.
I'll give it a shot. One day I was shopping with my Mother which if you knew her is like having a root canal without novocaine. And I was in a desperate rush to go to the bathroom and she was hurrying me along. So I went quickly into the bathroom, did my business came out and said "Gee, those are funny looking sinks". (URINALS) washed my hands, got out the door, turned around and realized I had just been in the MENS room. I must have turned 3 shades of red, as a man was just walking in as I was walking out.

Not a good idea to watch it at your age, and you also should focus solely on your own stimulation when masturbating, as porn can be distracting. Will have more intense without watching porn at the same tight.
It's okay to watch, in moderation. Don't get to the point where you find you can't get aroused without watching it.

It is okay to do that sometimes, but generally your body needs food throughout the day.
Absolutely... gotta look out for them ones
One's...what? Poo? No, not poo.
it's not the best idea...
1: Height doesn't correlate with penis size. A tall person can have a short penis, or a long penis. It doesn't matter. 2: Sure, I'd say that would work. If the girl "can't stand" your member, then she's overly picky and is probably not the best girl you could find for yourself.
Big guy in terms of height, in the USA average height for guys is only 5'8.5". So quite tall.. Penis size is big of course, 1.4 inches longer than average. So about 27% to 35% larger than average. So while it may look "small" to you it is quite large and "fill up" a girl quite well- in fact same size as me and I've bottomed out a few times- some girls are more shallow and so you have to take care when penetrating.
Just cause your on the taller side doesn't mean you'll have a giant dick , you have a pretty normal sized dick actually an of course you'll be able to satisfy a girl, your dick size isn't small by any means
It's great for your teeth and bones because of calcium and alongside water it is the most dental friendly thing you can drink too so overall it is good, full fat has a high calorie content but you can go for lower fat versions and use moderation, milk is healthy.
No!!! Don't drink another animal's milk, it's not for humans. Drink almond or rice milk seriously. Also milk makes people gain weight
It has calcium, but alot of milk is bad because you get too much which is bad for your gut
YES IF it is fresh from cattle (it has no negative effects), or powdered from fresh (skim fat doesn't matter). NO IF it is pasteurized (bunch of negative effects after years - including cancers, stones...).
Unless you happen to be lactose intolerant, it is good for you. A lot of the negative comes from people who say that the cows are mistreated...
Milk is for babies not adults
In moderation, I am told.
Yes!!!!!!!!!
It is a good idea to eat after your workout, even if it is 8:00 p.m.
the best time to eat! your metabolism/body is still working hard from your workout but its good to stay away from fats after right after workout, they tend to digest very slowly (i.e. almonds, avocado, etc) protein is ideal! but depending on what time you go to sleep, its best to not eat a ton of protein late late at night.
My coaches always said no, but I always did. Today, I wait a little bit and munch on a small snack of peanuts or something before eating a real meal later.
Yes I am. I ran 12 minutes on the treadmill and now I am eating a big plate of spaghetti and drinking a chocolate malt. How about you?
Hhhhg
Just eat protein and don't spike your insulin.
Depends on the cheese, actually. Many plain cheeses are. If it has a 'natural flavoring,' that can be gluten based. If it is a 'fancy' cheese then it can have gluten. Fancier cheeses with visible mold, like bleu cheese, can have the mold grown on wheat products and that remains contaminated when added to the cheese. And there are some fancy cheeses like beer-washed cheese which are obviously contaminated. But usually, plain cheese is ok
Cheese is Gluten free. Gluten free tends to have higher calories then none gluten free food.
Really, the only people who need to eat gluten free are people suffering from celiac's disease or are a little allergic or sensitive to gluten. For the rest of us - its good for us. Its sort of like avoiding peanuts or shell fish or milk if you aren't allergic to them. However, gluten is just found in grains. and processed grains should be avoided especially when on a diet to lose weight.
Cheese is gluten free. However you should know that the gluten-free fad is not a real thing. Cutting gluten out of your diet does not help you lose weight. I did gluten-free for a year because my doctor recommended it, and it was a total joke. Best thing to do is to cut sugar, limit carbohydrates, eat lean proteins, vegetables and fruits, and exercise. The exercise doesn't have to take long or be strenuous. You just have to be active (i.e. take a 30 minute walk everyday).
Yes. Gluten is from grains such as wheat, etc.
Yes
Don't use soap ,it will irritate your skin . I use a few drops of olive oil ., that's a good oil for your skin , also , only a few drops ,goes a long way .
Hand cream or lotion works best. Plus keeps the room from smelling like sperm.
Coconut oil is fine, but avoid getting it on clothes and sheets because it will stain. In scented hand lotions are also good.
if you use soap always wash it off afterwards but olive oil is a very good lube
Well there are many ways to do it. www.jackinworld.com has most of them. Enjoy.
never use soap, vicks vapor rub or icy / hot
Use Johnson & Johnson lotion
I am his mother, his dad is way from the house right now. He asked me, is this a small penis? It's 2 inches erect (He told me). I don't know the answer, so I'm asking you guys. He's turning 13 in a month. He's ashamed because he can't masturbate because he can't get a grip on it and he's scared that it will after him in later life. He has a tiny bit of pubic hair.
First off this Prolargentsize product works for me, I've been usin g it for 2 months and I've improved on my workouts and in the bed let' s just say I never have to worry again. It made me feel like a new man and I'd recommend this product to anyone who is slacking in the gym and at home. . Very thankfu l
It is too early to say whether he is still to get his penis growth or he has a hormone problem which is not causing full puberty coming on. Many boys do not start to get penis growth until 13.5y/o. If he hasn't started to grow penis wise by 14y/o I would take him to a doctor who hopefully can sort the problem out.
Your son is only at the early stages of puberty and his penis is perfectly normal for his age. He will grow quite rapidly from now on. There is no need for him to masturbate, but his penis will soon be long enough for him to get a good grip on it.
The Prolargentsize pills are fantastic. Within a week of taking them, I can definitely notice a difference in length and thickness. My gf agrees completely and is absolutely satisfied. The ProlargentSize pills don't just increase size, they increase confidence as well. A brilliant purchase if you want to vitalize your sex life !
Yeah he told you sure. More like you were peeking in on him and now you're upset you can't watch him jack it because he's just so tiny.
Rub it against your leg, lying side on. That's what I used to do before I started puberty.
Regardless, he's barely even 13 yet. He'll get there.
Hi try to bring him to a doctor they know better. at this age doctors can solve and cure this way better than let's say 25-40 years old so please bring him to a doctor God bless cya
You're not the mom. You're the son. That's obvious. Just wait.
Yes
Yes, 120 is ideal.
Yes, but it depends on the person. I for one think that is fat, but then agsin I have slways been underweight-skinny.
thick enough to be considered thick
Yes, you fat cow
it depends on her bod type xxx
If You eat too much of the fatty food it will make you fat. You are expected to keep carbohydrates in moderation, that is if you want a healthy weight. Simple carbs are quickly turned into sugar, then stored as fat.
Fat causes obesity as much as broccoli turns you green. Carbs and sugar cause weight gain. Low-fat diets are not healthy and were based on limited, faulty research. By using the threat of modern day diseases (like type-2 diabetes and alzheimer's) food companies are able to make billions of dollars from their highly processed 'food' products.
Because fatty food ISN'T what makes you fat. Excess CARBS make you fat.
Because it's NOT just fatty foods that make you gain weight. It's CARBS.
Mcdonalds dont ask when they grind up fat in thier mc meats
No, the sugars in the milk will damage your teeth, especially if being scrubbed around and rubbed into the enamel.
I think since milk has natural sugars in it, it shouldn't be used.
You don't have any bottled water in yr fridge or house? Just do it with mouthwash
Why would you do it with milk😂 I honestly don't think it would make a difference
You'd just add more sugar (lactose) to the cdavities that are already there
if you are in the beginning of your period ( first 2 years even ) it can do that and it's no big deal.
Only if it's because you had your period in Jan and Feb and then got pregnant.
don't your doctors ever tell you, that your cycle is tied to your diet....screw up your gut PH and the PH for your vagina gets screwed up and in turn your cycle gets affected...I'll bet you don't take quality food based vitamins and minerals, do you?
the year isn't over yet
Sit ups cause back problems. Nobody should be doing situps. Great stomach/ab exercises: crunches, planking, any balance exercise - standing on one leg, etc.
Do safe exercises only. You can find them in book, little abs workout book, Erika dillman, library. Supine, knees bent, lift one leg only if back doesn't lift
leg lifts....laying on floor or bed, no pillow, hands under buttocks lift both legs straight up then out, then back together then down, up out, in , down , up out , in down....don't over do it...you'll slowly notice you are able to more and more as muscles get stronger...THEN, a 20 min brisk walk is also good for stomach muscles
Try this 2 minute, 3 exercise abs circuit. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=puIE_yHNAUI
plank, side plank, crunches (lots of variations possible). google core strength exercises.
I recommend using: http://tc-cardio.com/
Pooping

I have this problem a lot. I am unmotivated and am VERY lazy but it sounds cheesy but helps to think about kids who can't have an education or those who have disabilities and can't learn up to the ability that you can. It also feels really good when you study and get a good test grade or something. ALso it might help to set rewards like "If I get an A on my bio test I can go out this weekend or go to the movies with my friends" --something to look forward to that you wouldn't normally do that will reward you for your good behavior.
I don't know what grade you're in and when it ends for you, but just know that once it's over with, then you can do whatever you want with your life. If you work hard now, it really pays off in the end. Don't work too hard, but enough so that you and others are content with it :)
Haha yes. Yes. Yes. Get a ******* scholarship and you won't be working three jobs in college.
just keep going and youll have an okay flat, stable career and maybe a puppy idk, its up to you. After all, school is just a fraction of your life and puppies are cool.
Your future will be good.
YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!!!! AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!
( Weight Loss Green Store Tea product ) is a wonderful product. I was watching what I eat (Low carbs) and exercising at least 3 times a week but hit a sticking point at 10 pounds down so I decided to try this product....two weeks later I am 16 pounds down!I works fantastic. It taste good and I use it only once a day, it cleans your system out that is for sure.
Carrie Underwood isn't taking weight loss anything. She's already quite fit.
All bullocks. That's nearly 2 pounds a day. I could eat nothing for 30 days and still not lose that much.
scam
Size 12-13

I don't know what is average but at 6 ft 5 in I have size 15 inch and extra wide feet. Lots of men and women do comment on the size of my feet and boots. Hope that helps.
Not sure any studies have been made on shoe size average, it is more a heredity thing. But a bigger guy generally has bigger feet- size 12 or more. Though I worked with a guy who was 6'3 and he wore a size 9. Tiny for his size.
It can vary. Figure 12-13 and sometimes a wider shoe.
i think 12
I've found that drinking a lot of water and eating plenty off celery can make you ejaculate more semen. Stay hydrated and eat fresh food, avoid salty processed junk food. Not joking, trust me it works!
LOL... you're how old and you still don't understand how the male body functions? How is it that you still do not know that the semen that you ejaculate does not come from your testicles? Semen comes from the prostate gland. Sperm, which is microscopic and cannot be seen with your eyes comes from your testicles and only makes up about 2% of the ejaculated fluid. You're an adult now... You need to quit talking like a 12 year old boy.
You cannot control the rate at which your testicles produce sperm, nor the rate at which your prostate and other glands produce the major portion of semen. Sperm form only 1-2% of your total ejaculate, the majority of which is semen.
Your balls are solid organs, and they don't fill up with anything. Your semen does not come from your balls. Only tiny amounts of sperm-- which only make up about 2% of your semen-- sperm is invisible too without a microscope. Semen volume is generally hereditary, most guys only produce about a teaspoon and no real way to increase semen volume significantly.
Well there really isn't anything you can do to make more of it however you can stay hydrated which will help volume some.
You clearly have no understanding of how your body works

NO CHANCE IS RIGHT AND IM NOT DOING LINKS..
Asking a question referring to something that is then no posted No The fool has said in his heart, there is no God - God that is how God defines a fool
I doubt that God does YouTube. In fact, it seems rather telling that everything God has supposedly said was told by a human. And the humans who spoke on his behalf often disagree with each other.
A food is one who says and thinks that there is no God.
He's a bit of a preacher!! Tbh he should keep his opinions too himself and believe what he wants without broadcasting this bs too everyone else
Today I found out I'm having a c-section, in a month I have my appointment. I'm freaking out cause that's definetly not what I wanted. I'm soooo nervous I can't even see blood cause I freak out! Is it really painful?? How is the recovery?? This is my first baby I'm 19 years old, I would love to hear some personal experiences ... Thank you!!!
The good news is you'll be totally numbed from your belly down during surgery (and for a couple of hours afterward), so your cesarean won't hurt a bit. But I've heard you do feel pulling when the baby is leaving the abdomen.
it doesn't hurt during the procedure. afterwards of course there will be some pain but not unbearable. If you are...ya know...extremely overweight recovery might take longer because of obvious reasons. (fold of skin over incision and weight pulling on incision, etc)
Hello, i am a 13 kid and i am interested in having six pack abs. I don't want to waste any time doing wrong excersices and diet and i am not sure what the right ones are. A lot of articles say that cruches are a huge waste of time and that they wont do any changes and others say that they are the most important kind of excersice after losing fat so the muscle will be able to be seen. I need to know what to do, thanks :)
I'm thirteen too and I'm also trying to lose weight, but I'm a girl so this might be different. But recently when I don't have school I do intermittent fasting (google it) that makes my body use fat for energy therefore burning it more effectively. On top of that I exercise and eat healthy. Abs are definitely made in the kitchen though so don't skip dieting. For exercise I do tabata and HIIT and have seen a huge difference in a few days. Good luck!
You're 13. Barely pubescent. Some guys are SO THIN that they have nothing but a six pack. Trust me, I dated one. Not attractive. Just wait a few years. If you really wanna get in shape, wait 'till your voice drops. Then you'll know your body is more mature and ready for strenuous exercise. But, if you REALLY wanna do something now, go for a run. Life LIGHT weights. Plank. Pushups. Simple stuff.
Wait until your 16. Your body still isn't done maturing. Plus you're only 13. Most gyms don't allow young kids in. Just eat healthy and walk or run every day or so if you want to lose weight.
It's a waste of time at 13 because your body isn't even developed. You can't work out but you won't see the results you want till puberty hits.
Why do you need abs? Don't say dating, because no matter how 'impressive' your abs are, it won't matter if your 'mommy' has to drive you and your girl everywhere. I wonder how romantic that'll be.
Workout in your house just do this Run as far as you can Do 25 push ups 4 times Do 100 flutter kicks Repeat the 2nd and 3rd steps
"Abes" as you put it are made in the kitchen. Low body fat percentage = visible "abes" Definition and size of abs are what you do in unit gym.
I was 15 when I stopped growing. Most males finish from 15- age 18. So you likely are done - few guys grow after 18.
I'm 5 9 and 3/4 and have been for about 6 months. I'm 17. I think I might be done growing but I also drink a lot of coffee so that might be stunning my growth. I would say 18-19 years old is when you fully stop growing
Males typically stop growing in height around age 18 or 19.
Men stop round 16 Zero chance.
Slim. Very tiny... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
Yeah. Put them in a blender along with some liquid and make a puree.
No. It is not. Unless you plan to make cream of carrot soup. or a smoothie.
even cooks would require some chewing, unless you cook them and make much out of them
Blender.
Make them into a smoothie
no it's not
Sure, suck them!
tell me more, why are you at the risk of jail? please seek help from your family members or go to your gp and ask for help. there is nothing that can't be fixed.
yes
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
Not really, try keeping it back for a bit when you take a warm shower(preferably baths)and retract it the most you can without too much pain and keep it like that for a bit.
Neither, cocopops is full of sugar and bananas are high in carbs and sugar. I am type 2 diabetic and have to stick to healthy eating and breakfast is something like boiled egg and wholemeal toast and I have lost 28lbs, Good Luck
Neither,to kick start your metabolism you need to eat a fairly hearty breakfast. Eat the breakfast of a king Lunch like a prince and dinner like a peasant.
Neither! Both loaded with sugar! Sultanas and coco pops. You'd be better off eating egg on wholewheat toast.
A protein-rich breakfast will make you energised for the day ahead.
Or not of people
Juice is better for break fast
Which one keeps you fuller longer? I don't care for either of the options personally.
Oatmeal I advice
Get rid of the skimmed milk in general
get a friend and and a X - acto knife and a clean needle nose pliers . suture self .
Either a general surgeon or an otolaryngologist would be a good person to consult.
Hello everybody. I'm a 15 year old girl and I am a freshman in a public high school. I have ADHD, Autism, Aspergers, ODD, HBP, Tourette's, Major Depression, Anxiety, and even more, yeah it's a lot I realize this. Any Ways I'm having some issues in school I just really don't wanna go at all! I am on meds for all of them My mom won't homeschool me. Can't afford private school and I am seeing councilors How can I survive 3 more years? It's very difficult. Please help me. I sit up crying every night not wanting to go.
Finish your education via correspondence school. No stress, no bullies, no mean teachers...plus you graduate early. I loved it---- As for depression, it's common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
You often have to focus on your health & have had to endure mistreatment. It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed, especially considering that others are reluctant to change. Yet also you are able to detect that it isn't your fault. Sometimes reassurance can be important in helping accept self-awareness. It might help to strive to apply 'one day at a time' as this can help in focusing on yourself as a priority. This shouldn't be confused w/ conceit but as a way to approach & accept responsibility.
It sounds to me like you use your so called diagnosis as an excuse to get out of doing what you don't want to do. If you have to cry, then cry and when you're done, put on your game face and do what you have to do. You have two choices. You can control your illness or let your illness control you. Which person would you rather be?
High school does that to everyone.
Hypochondria
It sounds like hypochondria. In the book, 'First Aid for Hypochondriacs', it says 'If you ever get a splinter, examine it closely because it could be an arrow'.
Don't worry about. Your bowels are just having withdrawal symptoms - they've been dilated and now they're having to retract back to a more normal state. Sometimes passing a poop can be more traumatic than having a baby - it sounds like you've had one of these episodes. To avoid passing poop-babies in future you should improve your diet to include much more fibre and drink plenty of water. This will ensure you poop little and often.
You had a big and somewhat painful poop. Great. Work on eating a more balanced diet and stop concerning yourself about cancer, which has nothing to do with your poop.
Health anxiety questions belong in Mental health, not cancer. People in cancer are dealing with life threatening illnesses, not imagination
Not even close to being colon cancer in any way shape or form.
No its not cancer, you have a bowel infection causing the cramps.
drink water, take ibuprofen, eat a banana. if none of that works, try again tomorrow. Longest I ever had that was about 3 days. sux
The nerve is twitching under my left eye, and my upper eyelid above my right eye. What could be the problem? This has been going on for 2 weeks.
I have a little secret which is that I am a player. I love to satisfy each and every beautiful lady I meet but for that I have to keep my man on its toes. These Prolargentsize pills have enlarged the girth and the size of my penis.
You're a Troll. Stop pretending that you are a young kid, Pervert!
Sick troll....
Which chin you talking about??
Craziest thing I've heard.
is like because it might make you look older that's why I don't
Maybe 'cause it's an odd shape, maybe 'cause it's too hairy, maybe you just think badly about your body.
I'm already 17, and I've had my period since I was 14, so I don't think this is normal. I've skipped periods before, but not frequently and never for this long. This time I haven't had my period for 3 months and i'm very worried. I'm not sure what's causing it, but pregnancy is out of the question (I'm sure i'm not.) Anyone have suggestions on what I could do first? Or should I go to see a gynecologist? Help! :(
Having excluded the risk of pregnancy, in other words you are ground zero in intercourse than you must get to understand the importance of the remainning and crucial aspects that make your health occur. In case there are little symptoms of pré-menstrual tension than go for a healthier way of life that includes plenty of activity specially the ones you like best and prefer meals that were proven healthier for you.
are you very thin or are you worrying about anything i know that when your weight falls to a certain level it can cause them to stop. i aslo know from experience that worrying can cause them not to come but usually only delays them a few weeks. get it checked out, id say youre okay because it is probably hormonal since you're so young and still developing but its good to get some reassurance from a health professional
see a gynecologist, there may be an underlying problem - medically which could later on cause problems in you reproductive capabilites. also, having irregular menstruation can cause great stress. once problem is identified, probably your menses would become regular too
No, you will never have babies, men don;t have babies but you likely can father a child with a girl. Getting slapped on your penis would not make you infertile-- your testicles produce sperm, not your penis.
Yes, a slap in the penis means you can't have babies. Sorry.
you'll be fine but if it bothers you see a doctor and get tested
men cant have babies
How on earth would we know. < M
I look really young for my age, so I get this a lot. I always giggle and say with a smile, It's not polite to ask a lady her age. Most people will take the hint and move on, but if not just keep smiling and don't give in. The persistent ones will probably start trying to guess your age so I just let them because they never guess right and eventually say yeah somewhere around there, let's go with that haha and then they'll let it go.
A couple thoughts for you 1. You attitude about your age is troubling. You might want to seek some counseling to figure out why this is such a big deal for you. 2. If all your friends and colleagues are ten years your junior, you might want to look for a more mature crowd to hang out with. 3. Either answer with the truth, a lie, or a witting comeback. "Old enough to know not to ask a lady's age." "As old as I've ever been."
You are not under any obligation to respond to any type of question, personal or otherwise, so next time you are asked a question that you do not wish answer, simply state as much and then choose to put your focus elsewhere. No need to be aggressive or confrontational in your response and if anyone pursues the matter, ask them to respect your privacy.
mimi gave the same advice i'd give. I'd also like to say, instead of trying to convince yourself that you are not old, figure out why it is you think your old, what makes you old? Work on seeing the truth from there and you won't feel so old anymore
What the hell does it matter how old you are? you can't change it can you? wait until you are as old as me, i am 67 and don't care who knows! if someone tells you their age it looks rude if you don't tell them how old you are,you could say " i would rather not say"
Answer: "Over 21." if they don't take the hint, "I'm sorry, but I don't really share that info. I can't imagine why it would be important or relevant."
People always ask your age when they first meet you. I don't know how you can get out of it unless you say I'm young at heart
This is a great home workout routine, but to lose a stomic you actually need to lose weight. This is done through dieting. Make sure you are consuming less calories then your body needs to maintain its current weight. First you must find your BMR. Then you must monitor your calories each day to make sure your eating less then the calories burning off through that and excercise. Ex: you way 300lbs with a bmr of 2800. You eat 2200 calories a day and gradually you start to lose weight. Weight loss is about calories in calories out. Not about how many crunches you do.
You will see results within the first week. Drink a lot of water and avoid food like salt and sugar. Do crunches every two days, because your muscles need some time to rest in between.
I have a good diet, or at least a lot better than it was. I'll have yogart, salads, no soda, fruits, and no fast foods. I have been drinking lots of water too.
Years? Your exercise are great, but they only build muscle under the fat. You can't turn fat into muscle. If you want to lose fat, you need to diet.
you cant lose belly fat doing that you have to change your diet
Intel you have Sexual intercourse with a male or female you stay a Virgin. Pleasuring your self do's not cause you to lose your Virginity.
No it doesn't. Masturbation is sort of practice for having sex. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it to much. You can only lose your virginity by having sex.
no, if you stick up a small object in your pūssy or dįck then yes
No you have to enter the vagina.
I swear on my life I'm not making this up. I took high doses of adderall from the ages of 12-19 and then stopped. Then out of nowhere when most people stopped growing years ago I start getting random growth spurts in my late 20's early 30's. So my point is if you took this the same thing may happen to you.
Meds do that... did you know that there are meds that make boys grow boobs? Yes, for real... it's called Gynocomastia. There are meds that cause blindness, meds that cause death. It's usually a good idea to read about the side effects of the drugs you take or you are going to be really confused if you just start growing boobs...
Adderall does not stunt growth. If that were the case there would be Millions of boys just like you
Yes there are, any hormonal therapy, or lack of production of growth hormones, can delay it. Also if you take alot of topical or systemic corticosteroids that can stunt growth. Did you know malnutrition also stunts growth?
Ya it is kinda gross but I think shoving your d up a girl's vag is kinda cleaner then shoving it up a dude's ***
When I was 12 I used to think the same thing (female) But now I'm older I've realised its a natural bodily function, that should be done in the privacy of your room. And btw, the world would die out if nobody had sex because that's how humans reproduce.
i used to think that when i was little, but now im 16 and i dont think its disgusting, its normal. i guess some people take a while to mature.
it's some kind of instinctual thing. not a lot of thought involved
You believe in "the lord"? EWWWWW why would you believe in such fairytales EWW.
You are five days post injury hardly an emergency. Ad the swelling subsides the bruising appears.
Seek help
ugh lucky you, I think I have a grade 3 sprain in my ankle, happened yesterday, unable to move my foot
The bruise is blooming. This is normal. Your body is breaking down the blood in the bruise, which makes it more colorful.
Go to a hospital
Hello! I am a doctor! Don`t care too much about it now... they are still going to change, once you are still developing... besides, there are many shapes of breasts and people in general don`t care about it when they are having sex other questions my email is jadecameronmd@yahoo.com
People have worst off situations, wow be lucky you have boobs and dont have vreast cancer. Everyones boobs sag, we are not Celebs that get fake ones!! Be greatful For what you have
Your brother is just being a butt. 117 is on the lower end of normal. You can always try and live a healthy lifestyle, even though you don't need to lose weight. Working out and eating healthy foods will prevent health problems and make you live longer.
Don't starve yourself, that will lead to bigger problems and permanent eating disorders that could follow you for the rest of your life. Do some exercise, or diet. Starving either leads to anorexia, or a lapse of even more eating than before.
Society says do not starve yourself, but if you are gaining wait rapidly you do not need to starve yourself just eat a very low calorie intake, and you should be fine. with that being said 117lbs for a 5'6" female is not overweight
By now you should know that brothers can be idiots. You are not fat and you should not starve yourself. You are tall for your age and your weight is perfect.
dont starve yourself
Yes, it's normal for the first time. As was possibly not being able to get hard due to nerves. As you get more comfortable with her, both issues will go away. Just relax and have fun, and remember the goal isn't an orgasm. It's fun and intimacy.
Excitement causes guys the first time or two to fire off quick.
Yes. The first time everything is too sensitive. If you are nervous, it can be difficult to get hard.
Yes.
Yes, it is completely normal to ejaculate quickly like that.

It sound like you might be allergic to something. Are you normally dairy-intolerant? Are you affected by any other dairy creams? If not, then it would be odd that you'd be affected by whipped cream. Maybe the cream you had contained some additive, such as a stabiliser, so that it stayed fluffed up for longer. Or maybe what you had wasn't whipped dairy cream at all, but an imitation made in a factory somewhere. Sorry, instead of answering your question, I've simply given you more to ponder.
Intolerance isn't the same as allergic. People with lactose intolerance sometimes can handle it one time but not the next. A food allergy usually causes symptoms like hives, itching , swelling lips etc.
You may be lactose. Or it could just be whipped cream in generally. I would stay away from it.
Maybe. I mean some of them are dairy-based I think.
Vacations are fun and a great experience. Think of it as an Adventure! Enjoy the new sights and surroundings, you will miss it when you get home. Guaranteed.
This is normal, don't worry. When a person goes somewhere, your body doesn't really adapt the environment. It is just like your body telling you " where are you? " It happens to me too. When I was on a vacation, and far away from home, I got diarrhoeas.
Been there done that.... Keep yourself occupied and try not to think about what you miss so much. I understand how you feel because i went thru it years ago.... Try to talk to someone there who could give you some support and comfort.
well it's normal and you miss the comforts of home
Weight loss in cancer patients is often a result of what's known as cancer cachexia (loss of appetite). This loss of appetite can be caused by the cancer itself as it spreads throughout the body or by treatments used to deal with th cancer. Weight loss can be caused by disease in the abdominal cavity. Weight gain is not uncommon for those having treatments that include steroids. Steroids can increase an appetite which results in weight gain. My weight has gone up and down like a yo-yo in the past 4+ years I've been living with cancer. Down 12 pounds, up 30 pounds, down 50 pounds, up 48 pounds, down 15 pounds ... and so it goes.
This depends to a large extent on the type of cancer, where it is located, and how advanced it is. Cancers of the digestive tract often cause weight loss because they leave patients without the ability to eat or digest food correctly. Some of these cancers are also "functional" in the sense that they interfere with or block the function of organs which are necessary for digestion, including the pancreas and liver. Or they can cause other problems related to function, such as blockages of the colon or small intestine. Cancers in other parts of the body aren't as likely to cause weight loss.
For the most part, it does not lead to weight loss. Some specific cancers may cause weight loss, and cancer cells are more metabolically active, so they do burn a few extra calories, but not enough for your weight to yo-yo. Diet causes your weight to go up and down.
Depends on the type of cancer. Most cancers do not cause weight loss. Some cancer treatments can cause weight loss. Others can cause weight gain.
Now why would you suspect that a disease that sucks the life out of you would cause weight loss!!! It does cause mentality decline though!!! GET AWAY FROM MAINSTREAM MEDICAL AND THEIR TOXIC PARTNERS BIG PHARMA!!! Their cure rate is worse then not doing anything!!! I AM NOT KIDDING PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE DYING FROM THE CURE, not the cancer when chemo and radiation and surgery are used!!!Use plant essential oils like frankincense oils or CBD oils to cure it yourself not just treat it with cancer causers until you die!!!!!!
It usually doesn't cause weight loss. Treatments often cause weight gain.
Mine uterine cancer didn't. It just depends on where it is and how advanced. I've done two chemos now and haven't really lost any either.
If you can't eat yes. Cancer of the throat, oesophagus, stomach for example.
Yup
I want to be skinny. I know its not good for me, but it makes me happy. the fact that im not eating makes me feel good about myself. I want to eat because im hungry, but when i see food i feel sad. I want to be skinny, im 140 pounds and 5'4. I dont like that. Im fifteen years old, a girl. Its okay to only eat a few small things a day and drink water right?
You are developing an eating disorder, which is absolutely not good. A much better, healthier and more sustainable way to lose weight would be to eat smaller meals with lean, quality protein, plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains and little extras like pop, ice cream, candy, etc. You need to develop a positive relationship with food, not a negative emotional one. You should talk to your doctor or a nutritionist to make a proper diet and exercise regime. Don't try to do it alone. You could end up in the hospital or dead. Seriously.
I'm going to start by saying that I'm not here to tell you how to live your life, just to explain what you are doing to your body. Eating too little can actually cause you to gain more weight. what happens is that your body doesn't get the nutrients it needs so it starts feeding off itself, muscle tissue much more than fat. this also slows your metabolism wayyy down so anytime you eat a normal size meal your body doesn't metabolize it properly, and this causes weight gain. eat small but balanced meals and exercise is your best bet.
Your orthodontist should have given you instructions. But typically elastics/rubber bands need to get switched out at least 2-3 times a day so they remain strong. And yes throw the old ones out
Yes, because they get too stretched out. Try to make a habit out of throwing out your bands when you take them out before you eat, and put new ones in when you are done. I sure hope you do that, actually. The bands are supposed to be tight so that they can fix your bite problems. If you are re-using bands or wearing them for too long, the bands will lose their purpose.
Yes, you need new ones everyday so do throw them away!
yes throw them away or bacteria will grow all over them and could spread disease and they will also smell nasty due to the bacteria
yes
My girlfriend has been depressed for a very long times. We've been together since febuary. She's insecure about her looks because she was bully in school. Her last relationship literally destroyed her. The guy used her for sex then just left her. Now because of her past relationships, she's doubting that I love and tat I'll eventually hurt and leave her. So she talks about ending it all. I've Troyes everthing What can I do to make her cheer up
Try and have a serious conversation with her. Like sitting down and chatting. Since this seems serious I'd suggest talk in a private place and absolutely no alcohol when talking. Show your sincerity and tell her how you really feel and think about her. Be honest with her and tell he how you think the relationship could work and would like. She seems like she has trust issues now, maybe do something to gain that trust for her. Make her feel that you love her for her and not sex or anything else. Good luck
you need to keep the lines of communication open and talk with her all of the time and reassure her your not like the other guys and you'll be there for her
All I want to to right now is to kill myself, I'm sorry I'm not posting this for getting attention or something like that. I just want to say it before I end up exploding because I feel so frustrated. I can't handle this, I'm so sad and depressed all the time and to make everything worse I'm unable to communicate with people. My father is literally dying and my mom doesn't have a job. We are so ****** up, I have more than 2 weeks without going outside, I'm failing all my classes at school, why should I keep living?
Don't give up! Sometimes it can be really hard when those negative feelings take over but they will pass. Try and find small positives in each day no matter how small they may be. Find something to distract yourself from your feelings, sometimes watching telly or listening to music helps me. You have to believe you will have better days. One day you will have your own life separate from your parents, don't give up on that and lose sight of that. Nothing stays the same, life has ups and downs. There will be better days.
What I do think is that it's foolish to make a blanket statement that it's weakness to forgive an adulterer. Infidelity has vastly varying degrees. It is always a betrayal and it's never justified. But to presume all instances of infidelity are the same, and to forgive any of them is weak, is foolish beyond measure. Adultery is dealt with on a case by case basis, and I would never judge a betrayed spouse for the way they handled and coped with infidelity.
Depends on why they are being forgiven. Sometimes it might be, if a person is forgiving them because they'd rather stay with that person than be alone (even if the adulterer is not remorseful or doesn't intend to stop). That would be weakness, to me.
No, there are too many other factors that play into that in a marriage. Like do you love the person anyway, does your relationship offer other things, like companionship, and affection, are there children involved. Is he involved emotionally, or is it just physical. It's not a weakness to forgive.
If you mean promptly, it depends on the circumstances. Are they remorseful? Did it happen once or frequently? Did they come clean or did I have to find out about it another way? In the long run, forgiveness is strength, not weakness, and you should try to find it if you can. Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies.
I think it's weakness to forget one's marriage vows. The Clinton's, even through "better or worse" scenarios, remained faithful to those vows, under their god. And you in the GOP claim this is a BAD thing, yet, you support many in the GOP with multiple divorces. Your hypocrisy is abhorrent.
If my husband ever cheated on me, I would learn to forgive him in my heart, but I would still divorce him, because such a serious wrong needs to have serious consequences. The only reason I would possibly not divorce him was if it was a completely spur of the moment thing and he was incredibly remorseful.
Not weakness, but ill advised. Adulterers rarely regret their action; they regret getting caught.
Aren't we all human we suffer through our own problems
"let he who is without sin cast the first stone". - Jesus Christ. we must forgive, but this doesn't mean there aren't going to be consequences.
its might be pragmatic to forgive.. just don't let him/her walk over you and take your forgiveness for granted,, make the person pay for their actions
Honey no need to worry. If you are sure that you have all the signs such as discharge, breast development, mood swings etc then you period is on its way. Every girl is different some start as early as 8-9 years and some at 15-16 years. If you are 17 and still no period go to a doctor. 2 years after breast development and hitting puberty you will get your period. Do NOT be stressed as this is will make things worse. Good luck!
Nothing is wrong with you and you're just a late bloomer.
Dry fûck yourself
it's time for that talk with your mother
Once an addict always an addict.... You can abstain from using the substance that you are addicted to but you will always be addicted to it. This applies to street drugs, many prescription drugs, alcohol, cigarettes. Recover? Depends on what you consider recovery... I haven't had a cigarette in over 5 years and still when I smell it on someone I crave it... my mouth waters and I can taste it and I want one so bad..... Am I recovered?
I suspect most addicts do not recover from their addiction; those who are able to manage their addiction fight a battle over their addiction every day.
To be honest Yes , I'm also addicted to cough syrup and the addiction is really weird. If a person is willing to live sober than they can be saved if not it'll continue
no it's not true as i am a recovering heroin addict who is now twenty years clean
It depends on their will. If they don't want to recover, they don't. If they want to, they usually do (if they don't, I doubt they wanted to.)
nope
I only know herpes basics so I could be wrong, but no I would not. I thought you could get herpes from other areas as well like the mouth
A condom does NOT prevent the spreading of Herpes. No I would not.
Condoms will not stop herpes.
I am feeling really distressed right now... I have exams in a week, I'm too stupid to get anything right, I don't even know why I'm bothering going to school cz the future feels hopeless and I just want to do something. I hate school, I hate the control they exert over us I just want to have control over my life! help!!
First off, I want to wish you luck and hope you do your best 👍🏼. Also, I do not think you are stupid, many people just have to study and work to achieve their goals. You may have ask someone (family, friend, teacher) to give you extra help. Harming yourself will not fix anything. If you harm yourself and do not study, you will fail the exams! And nobody wants to fail, am I right? Do not worry, soon you will get out of school. Remember, school only controls you to make you succeed in life. To succeed in life you need good grades as well so you need to ask someone to be your study buddy. Good luck!!! ☺️
I'm so sorry about what you're going through. I think you should find a counselor or a trusted adult who you can talk to. Self harm is serious, and you need to get help. You sound as if you are under a lot of stress, and have a lot of emotional pain. Please talk to someone, because self harm can lead to something a lot more dangerous... I hope everything gets better. Take care xx.
Go to a doctor, go to a therapist and fix what you're going through. The internet won't fix this, that's for sure.
Go to a doctor. You need medical help, and no one can give you medical help over the internet.
I think you should tell him. I hope that this is what you want, though. You should just pull him aside one day, lift up your sleeve, answer the first 3 questions and if he has any more, tell him that that's enough. If he is considerate and you tell him that you don't want to talk about it, then he should understand. I wish you luck telling him :)
Well he's gonna see the scars eventually. Even with surgery there will still be something. Might as well tell him. Really it's your decision. You should just think it over I guess.
You should definitely tell him. The worst thing you can do in a relationship is to keep secrets. Just tell him that there was a part in your life that was tough to deal with, and you USED to be a Cutter. Use the word USED TO to clarify that.
Why not take a sharpie and write on your arms "Ask me about my scars". This should spark the conversation you want to have. If you feel that could be awkward you could always write him a letter telling him about the scars and why they are there.
You can tell him simply by just telling him and not worrying about it. If he really likes you he wont judge.
That's up to you.. Personally I don't see anything wrong., but I'm not that religious either. If it is creating a problem between you and your faith then maybe it is something you want to re-think before doing anything. Ultimately it's a decision that only you can make.
nope your fine. sex is fine too. masturbate much as you can and anywhere you can. have masturbation parties with your girl friends and do it together
i would wait to age 21
It is not wrong, nor a sin
if you're a man it is
Lack of identity. Other than working, he has no clue who he should be. He's watching TV because there's nothing else to do. But he refuses to watch it because even that seems pointless. In other words, he's depressed and he needs something to get him back in the cheerful spirit. Maybe you two should join a group together so he can make some new friends?
Tell a dr. about all this and ask for Zoloft. it helps the brain to produce sufficient Seratonin so he can function normally. It will make you so much healthier and happier. It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it.
Maybe "quiet" is just his personality..... is this a change from his normal self or is this just his normal self?
Try to please him, try a wake up bj
It could be that. Or maybe it was something else you ate, maybe you picked up a virus or bacteria... who knows. None of my partners have ever complained about diarrhea after having performed oral sex, but I wouldn't go as far as to say it wouldn't cause it. Maybe you're sensitive to it, again... who knows.
It's unlikely yet possible in an alternate universe.
Not normal and unlikely his semen (sperm is only a tiny, invisible part of his semen) would cause diarrhea.
sure not (i fyou stay under one liter)
The chinese food you see at restaurants are fast food chinese food. Chinese people don't eat that stuff in their homes. We eat an entirely different type of food. We don't stir fry rice or noodles everyday in our homes. If you want chinese food such as fried rice or noodles, its much healthier to make it at home. Its less sodium, less greasy, no MSG. You can also stir fry vegetables at home too. Its not unhealthy. In fact, its one of the healthiest dishes you can ever make.
Mark: Most Chinese food is high calorie and greasy. You are more than 100 pounds overweight, and the last place you need to visit is a Chinese buffet. You should be eating a low calorie diet with lots of fresh fruits & vegetables. And you need to start exercising. You've spent the last four years asking questions here about how to improve your personal appearance. And pretty much everyone has told you that you need to lose weight. And despite all that advice, you just kept gaining weight. You are 5-5, small-framed, and 232 pounds. That's morbidly obese. Why aren't you doing anything to fix that problem? Do you actually like being fat?
It's unhealthy because of extreme salt and msg. It's cooked at a high temperature in fact. That makes the meat carcinogenic in the surface. People tend to overeat it. Steamed vegetables and quick stir fry at home in both, low salt, portion size, can be healthy.
Depends on what you get. The typical chinese take out is fast food alot of it is bad for you but theres some things thats good for you like chicken veggies and rice but anything fried is bad for you
once in a while is fine, in fact it's pretty healthy food.
you'll be fine if it's done once in a while
But is it ok if I eat it ONCE IN A WHILE?
no, they are very healthy and delicious.
then don't or get a coke, nobody will know what's in it....just slowly sip......and if you leave your drink on a table, never pick it up it could have been spiked by an idiot, never take that chance, go get a fresh drink made the way you want it, not much booze or none.....it's really a bad habit to get into...kinda like smoking
Get a cup, fill it yourself, act like it's booze but don't drink any. Know one has to know. Or, simply say you don't drink. You don't have to explain why or why not.
i'd be more worried about spiked drinks. just don't drink.. you'll be sorry if you do. proms are where you get raped. guys are always putting crap in girls drinks.
Don't drink if you don't want to drink... there is no law which says you have to.
Bring in a beer bottle filled with soda
no one is forcing you to drink and don't do it if you don't want too
drinking is illegal so you better not - if caught, you can kiss graduation goodbye
Well the thing with getting tone is you gotta do it everyday and be consistent with it. As you start building up your muscles you're gonna need to maintain a healthy diet with portionss that match your activity level. And as time passes by you should be scheduling your workouts to build up over time.
Eating doesn't ruin a workout. It FUELS a workout. You NEED food to be able to consistently work out. If you don't like starting over, stop stopping.
Core exercises and interval training. Interval training helps cut down fat, while core exercises (depending on which ones) work out different parts of the ab area !
YES you are. So contact Child Protective Services. They can get you into a decent foster home.... Tell a dr. how you feel and ask him/her for Zoloft. It takes 2-4 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will slowly become a confident, healthy, happy person.--- Remember, God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
YEs, you are being abused, or you were, by your mom. Go to the counselor at school and tell him/her you are suicidal. They have to report it and that can get you help and start the steps to fixing your evil family. If your mom drags you around gain, call the police. If you have to, call the police and tell them you are suicidal.
Yes of course you are! This goes without saying! Talk to your school guidance counselor.
Do you think it should function on Capitalism, as a business, trying to pry every dollar out of our kids that it can with sports fees and things like that? So it can generate more revenue and fund more projects to make more money? Or do you think it should function as a Socialist policy, having a steady rate of funds that can be controlled and calculated, functioning as a right, rather than a business? Basically what I'm trying to ask you is, is education a right, or a privilege for the wealthy?
In Cuba education is free, right through university, so they have some of the best educated people in the world. They are far better educated than americans. Education is a necessity for the economy and technology of the country, so any country should invest in the education of its children.
I pity your parents, they probably think they raised a child with a brain but man oh man are they wrong. You're a f*cking (unt dude, and if you're too weak to compete in a capitalistic society then by all means get the fck out of the nation and don't come back, but peddle your pinko socialism somewhere else faggt.
The fact that all politicians send their children to private schools rather than state schools must mean something.
Childbirth
I haven't experienced being kicked in the balls- but women die from childbirth more often than a man will ever die from being kicked in his genitals. Sorry if that breaks some delicate egos.
getting kick in the balls hurts more after a childbirth many women want to do it again I never heard a guy say he wanted to get kicked in the balls again
childbirth alone seems much more painful and thats not including the months of pregnancy, hours/days of labor, and about 40 years of monthly menustration…so basically guys can shut up
My aunt told me child birth feels like you grab your underlip with both your hands an pull it all the way over your head.....😳 So you decide...
When a mule does it, you'll know.
childbirth
Not a significant amount but it does make you feel fuller and aid in digestion
Nope
No. If anything it increases digestibility so you get more from it. The amount of energy used chewing is trivial.
For health reasons, you should have 2000 calories a day. Healthy calories. No more than 135 carbs. You need to eat that much to achieve full growth and not mess up puberty. 1/4 of your diet should be protein, 1/4 whole grain, 1/2 fruit and veggies. Drink half a cup of water per hour awake, in addition to other things you drink. Increase your activity level. Go for a walk. Enjoy the spring. 20 minutes is about a mile. Park at the far end of the lot. Take the stairs. If you hear music that makes your feet tap, get up and dance to it. Summer is coming, go swimming.
I ate like 100 calories a day for about 3 months and I went from 205 lbs to 100lbs!! That's all I did! Don't know if it matters but I was 18 years old and female. Now to keep myself at 110lbs, I occasionally starve myself a few times and I stay at the weight! No joke! Works for me!
Eat 1250 if you don't exercise. If you do, 1500. These are the numbers in most diet books. Above all, neither starve nor skip meals to reach your goal.
I called the customer service number, I spoke to Andera. She was very informative and detailed about Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea , and several other of their products. She was very polite and pleasant to talk to. I received great customer service. Just give it some time to work, you will feel better and loose fat and weight in the process .
No idea. I can give my considered opinion only after seeing the actual patient. In order to render maximum help to you in this critical juncture, I need your present exact location. Please tell me the shortest route to reach your place.
Sounds like normal adolescent mood swings. Hang on, they will go away.
Seems like it you should go to counselling
Try to get therapy and some antidepressants. :)
If you are stupid enough to cut off your freaking penis, yes it will hurt LIKE HELL. If the bleeding isn't stopped fast, you will die a painful death from blood loss. So just please keep your penis on.
Yes, you can and you'll find out if it hurts a few seconds after.
Yes it will hurt and may die from blood loss.
Why? Yes it would hurt.
You can. But it will hurt like a muthafucka
Do it and find out
Yes, and yes.
you'd better let it as it is
ask caitlin jenner
Can or if, whats the question child?
So I've been having pelvic pain for about a month now, and when I pee I feel like there's more I need to get out. The most alarming thing to me though is that for months though I've had no appetite, and I feel very full fast. For example all I've eaten today was 2 cookies and then around 10pm tonight, I ate a little bit of Chinese food. Some days I don't eat ANYTHING at all until 1 sometimes 3 in the afternoon. I know all of these are symptoms. But I read that it's rare in younger people, and women that have already had successful pregnancies (I have a son) so I'm not sure ....
At age 17, what you are describing could be just about anything. A bladder infection would be my first guess.
Sounds like an infection.
NO, you don't have cancer any where. So get checked for a UTI and Chlamydia.
Not likely, but see a doctor.
See your gynecologist, he will send you for an ultrasound.
A red and itchy penis indicates that you have damaged it or have an infection. The latter is most likely if you are uncircumcised. You should see the doctor if it doesn't clear up within 24 hours since the sooner treatment is started the easier any infection is to cure.
Find some anti-fungal cream and put that on it. Even cream or spray for athletes foot. That should take care of the problem in a day or 2.
Balantis maybe seek a doctor
Sounds like a reaction to something.
Help you what? We can't do anything for you. Ask your doctor about that.
Have it surgically removed immediately.
So what did you do with it the day before yesterday. < M
Chop it off then!
Don't be silly. You could look this up on the net too
You can work it out on this website - I would say you are OK and healthy weight. But check yourself. https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi/calculator....
A very simple answer to your question: NO
im 16 and i weigh 50ish lbs
No you are Not.
no obviously not?
Not always. People sometimes even have heart attacks and don't know that they have had one. They are called silent heart attacks, and the symptoms are not the same as for typical heart attacks. If you have a heart attack you chances of survival are usually much better with appropriate medical attention.
Not necessarily. Many people survive a heart attack without medical attention. There is something called a silent heart attack, where someone doesn't realize that they had a heart attack. They think they pulled a muscle, or they think it's indigestion. Make no mistake: even if you survive, significant damage will be done to your heart muscle without medical treatment. You should seek emergency medical care if you are having a heart attack.
Like almost every thing in medicine, there is a spectrum of results. For a MI it can range from a catastrophic event where the person dies even with medical attention, to a very mild one that the person is not even aware of. So no, not everyone dies if they do not get attention. They may have cardiac damage which impairs their life (such as very tired, short of breath etc) to nothing.
also keep in mind people use the term heart attack and cardiac arrest interchangeably and they are NOT the same. A cardiac arrest is always fatal unless treatment is given immediately. Cardiac arrest could follow a heart attack but they are not the same. Less 2% (it might be 4% now) of people survive cardiac arrest outside the hospital. The rise in survival is due to requirements and elective purchase of automatic external defibrillators in public places as well as quick acting people who know CPR Cardiac arrest may or may not have symptoms. CARDIAC ARREST AND HEART ATTACK ARE NOT THE SAME
Sudden cardiac arrest is not a heart attack (myocardial infarction) but can occur during a heart attack. Heart attacks occur when there is a blockage in one or more of the arteries to the heart, preventing the heart from receiving enough oxygen-rich blood.
Not necessarily, however, your chances of living are rather low if you dont seek attention asap. If you or someone is having one or showing symtoms, call 911
There are mild ones that peoplemight not even notice. Severe ones can cause part of your heart to die, very severe ones will kill you in a second.
Not necessarily. There are differing severities of heart attack.
Most of the time
what the f*ck dude? nobody wants to see your d|ck!
Quite big, but you measure with a ruler or tape measure to know the size. Average adult size is 5.16 inches. By the way posting your 14 yr old sex organ is considered child porn, so need to remove it as soon as possible.
Yeah I'm not looking at a 14 year olds dick.
Is it Date Night or Fright Night?
You're not on the right section
Cigarette smoking leads to atheism.. and atheism leads to homosexuality
No. But smoking crack might lead to a straight guy having gay sex for money in order to buy more crack.
No, the disorder is caused by negative childhood experiences, positive and negative, with adults of both sexes.
Hey, remember that every alcoholic started on breast milk.
Astroglide is the best lubricant
what do you think?
You still have a couple of years when you might grow. There is no way we can know if you have finished growing. Most likely your final height will be somewhere between that of you mom and that of your dad. However, it is also possible that you have finished growing.
You are shorter than would be predicted from your parents' heights. You should see a doctor soon while there is still time for growth.
you are most likely at least 90% of your final height
It is very likely unless your puberty started late
You know where cutting got me? Sent to a therapist and a mental hospital Theres others ways to cope. One day you may not mean to but you'll cut more and more and deeper then you'll see all this blood dripping from yours arms and will start to feel dizzy then all the sudden your awake in the ER or "asleep" 6 feet deep Lucky for me it was only ER Im not telling you don't im telling you think about it
Dear, you're not thinking of the scars you'll have afterwards, cutting that deep. I see postings here all the time on how to cover the scars from self harm. Google self harm, find out why you do it.
It's safer to cut the palm of your hand, or better yet, the tip of your finger. It makes a smaller incision, heals faster, and puts you at less risk of death.
Cut the palm of your hand. Lots of blood will come out but it's *safer*.
How about you dont cut yourself and get some help
Do for her what you would want her to do for you. Just be there for her. Bring her some crayons and a sketch book. Mental hospitals and boring, so when you visit her don't ask her about them. Don't walk on egg shells around her. Just treat her like you would treat someone who was hospitalized for being sick. And whatever you do, don't ask her about her attempt. She's going through a rough patch. She tried to end her life and she failed. She doesn't need to be reminded. She just needs to know that you're there for her.
you can't do anything but print this out for her: -----Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Whatever you normally do..... go to school, hang out with your friends.... visit your sister in the hospital. Take her some coloring pens and one of those awesome adult coloring books. Psych wards are really boring. Treat her the same way you would treat her if she had her appendix taken out... coloring book, pens.... and chocolate is good too. :)
Send some flowers
She's where she needs to be to get help. Support her and love her when she gets back home.
Talk to a family member. Or talk to her and keep reminding her how much you love her. I'm so sorry you had to go through that.
Visit her at the hospital each day and send her gifts and say you love her each time you visit her. :)
Nothing. What can you do?
Bill Cosby. He does not bite their lip while he is raping them
Bill Clinton pays (or arranges for the Clinton Foundation to pay) the Energizer Bunny a lot more money than Bill Cosby paid the women he raped.
I don't know, but Clinton did not have to Roofy his women.
See a Dr. Chiroqwacktors of any self claimed method or cults are not anything close to being doctors. Funny how chrioquack apologists keep commenting that cracking the spine and neck alleviates symptoms...Funny how they can't prove subluxions exist...Funny how they can't demonstrate a plausible mechanism, Funny how they pretend that there is some evidence for their treatments.
Start by going to your family doctor and getting an opinion about what you should do. Your family doctor will analyze your situation and recommend who you should see.
structural distortions are most often the result of muscle imbalance rather than developmental anomalies or injury. muscle imbalances are most often due to nerve interference, which causes muscles to both elongate and weaken. see an hio method chiropractor to correct the cause of nerve interference.
Podiatrists are good at this.
Gag means your throat spasms like you're about to throw up but nothing comes up. Throw up means vomit comes out your mouth.
Gag: cough/wretch that comes before puking (makes a "wretch" sound) brush your tongue: when you hit the back, you may gag Throwing up: vomit exits your mouth and hits the floor (or osme unlucky bystander......yuk!)
gag is when you almost throw up you basically make the noise and movement but you dont... i got braces and when they but the goo on my roof of my mouth it almost went down my throat cause there was a lot and i gagged
Gagging is when your throat will spasm but nothing will come out- it's like you're vomiting without the vomit. Threw up must mean they actually did puke, most likely from the pain
Every female vagina doesn't looks pretty. Vagina is made to be elastic for birth and the reason the lips has folds of skin. Everything is designed with purpose not for beauty. Although vagina is similar in shape no matter what race, they vary in skin color from light to dark pigment, vary in size due to the hereditary distribution of fats and the form of pubic mons.
A vagina it's pretty aways. But over the years of being around men they do camp are vaginas. But all men like different things so don't worry about.
A lot of girls find their own vagina ugly. Heck, I find vaginas in general to be a little ugly. The good thing is that they are usually hidden and guys appreciate them regardless!
Post a pic of it and i'll help you decide if it's worth the time of day or not..and this is all assuming you do actually have a vagina in the first place and not some dude.
Every Vagina is designed to help us have and enjoy sex for pleasure have periods and have babies. Every vagina is unique and a person who is true lover accepts unique pussey it would be beautiful rather rhan ugly.
I'm sure it is not but a lot of girls do worry about what their' look like, a guy is going to have his mind on something else, the pleasure it is going to give him.
That's not on the list of the things guys care about.
you really shouldn't worry about such things , since this part of your body is normally hidden in your underwear and only seen by you
Heavy enough, yes :)
A have a heavy set of camel toe. It goes down to my foot and it weighs 50 Lbs
Yes and I'm getting them reducted I cannot take it. Any girl with small Chest and bigger bottom is so lucky boobs are literally a curse
No, a heavy set of cheeks.
Nope
heavy set of melons does that count
No. But i have a heavy set of ***.
Goose pimples for me. Ittybittytittycomittee member here.
so heavy I can never drown
There is a limit to what can pleasurably fit in your vagina but almost any woman can take almost any penis. It comes down to arousal. If you aren't fully aroused and ready to go then it will hurt. When you are aroused, your vagina actually expands to allow a penis to fit. Talk to your guy about trying more foreplay and have him bring you to orgasm first then give it a try.
Well, if it's painful, why don't you tell him to stop and take a break?
It's not going to work.
use to be elvis impersonator made good money now i lost my peanuts how can i be an elvis impersonator without my peanuts? what good is my banana without my peanuts? i'm bacon you, peas!
I managed to control it well, with aspirins and being in a place calm and dark , also with strong coffee , or things that have enough caffeine as a recommendation.to space migraine attacks take a grapejuice every day for 90 days , and then you stop taking it for 90 days, so hardly get, well, that is what I do.
In addition to what Amelia recommends, try using an ice pack or cold cloths on your head and neck. With me, things improved after my doc gave me a prescription for sumatriptan .

No but it puts you at a higher risk of Non-Hodgikns Lymphoma, google it.

My boyfriend suddenly came down with sickness yesterday (a Sunday) and has been diagnosed with tonsillitis today. I saw him Friday and we made out for a solid two hours, should I be concerned I will get it too? I have no sings of any of the symptoms at the moment, but should I expect to develop it too? Also, how long is a logical amount of time to wait to lock lips with him again? He has started taking antibiotics today. Cheers
before starting treatment and until the first 24 hours of antibiotic treatment elapsed - one has to stay clear off persons with tonsillitis... cause you you made out with him on Friday- even though you've got no signs so far I should suggest you to stay watchful for several days up to a week- from now -and if you feel a sore throat- get to your doctor...
about 15 years - just to be sure
tonsilitis is NOT contagious

As much as an *** the other guy (rain) seems, he or she has a point. Sinus Infection, key word infection means there is a virus or bacteria present, which antibiotics will help your immune system fight this. I know sometimes doctors don't seem like they know what they're doing, you can always look around and find one you are comfortable with and once you have one just trust their judgement, you do not possess a doctorate in medical science
No, you don't stop antibiotics until you've taken the whole dosage. Doing so can result in more resistance bacteria being left and multiplying which will make your infection even harder to treat. The doctor prescribed it so they obviously think it will be of some value to you. Antibiotics cannot be used to treat viral infections, the doctor appears to think you have a bacterial infection. If you're concerned, go back and speak to your doctor about it but DO NOT stop the antibiotics unless you're told to do so by a medical professional or until the treatment course is over.
It's important that you finish the whole course of antibiotics. They keep working even after you have finished them. If it's a bacterial infection, you run the risk of making your sinus infection even harder to treat. So please finish them.
A person with a doctorate degree saw you and prescribed this and you are asking the morons on here for advice?? Really????
It might. It'll definitely kill lots of your gut bacteria.
If you decide to try the product of Ultra Organic argan life Treatment,you have to be careful the product whis is %100 pure one. My scars completely clear up in about 5 weeks!

115 is very good, the 85 is ok but could be a bit lower and presume you are slightly stressed? I am nearly 60 and mine is 125/80
Yes.
yes, your 100% fine, your in the norm, what is your problem, that you assume a normal blood pressure is abnormal,
yes
it's fine
That is damned good.
Sure it's safe. You can try for 99 years and nothing will happen. Hypnosis to change eye color is one of the silliest hoaxes out there.
Hypnosis is pure quackery. Safe and cheap way to change color is opaque contact lens.
If hypnosis worked to change your eye color, it would be the first time ever in history. Your eye color is determined by your genes -- DNA. Hypnosis will not change it.
The only thing hypnosis might do was make YOU think your eyes were hazel. To everyone else they'd be brown
Sure it's safe...because it's impossible so...
Can I come and watch? This would be great !

I would talk to a pharmacist about crushing the pill/opening the capsule. You can call the location that you went to and they can probably answer your questions over the phone. I know that in capsule form, antibiotics can often be added into a substance like yogurt or applesauce and taken that way. When I had strep throat I could barely swallow anything so I know that there are ways around the typical swallowing method with almost every type of medication.
Ouch, I know how painful this can be - poor you! Use a straw to sip the water through and after a couple of sips take another, stick the pill through your lips, tip your head back and swallow. It will be painful but you can do it! It feels as though you can't but you can... As the other answer says, don't crush them, that will result in bits of medication sticking to the back of your throat which would be bad. Best of luck
Well hand lotion is common as is vaseline, baby oil etc. Many people like vaseline because it doesn't dry out and continues to be slick all through the session.
As Alice pointed out, just go pick up some actual lube. It's relatively inexpensive (under $10) and there is no age restriction on it's purchase or possession.
Baby oil is cheap and lasts longer than lube and is more effective if you have tight foreskin. Otherwise there are many massage oils and even food oils that work. < M
Try none. Most guys don't use "lube" to masturbate. Just go slow and easy, gentle strokes, don't create friction and you will be fine.
I don't use Lube. if you need something masturbate until Something comes out lick your hand smear the stuff all over and use that. gross but works also sticky.
Buy a tube of KY Jelly or other lube. The cashier couldn't care less about what your buying.
Coconut oil is tops.
Lotion is the best.
go to the pharmacy grab some ky
No. However, deep inhales of cannabis can make the smoking of cannabis more effective. The volatile chemicals that make up the scent can extend the effects or make them slightly stronger. For the same reason that eating mangoes beforehand can increase the effects of cannabis, terpenes that create the scent of cannabis make active cannabinoids cross the blood/brain barrier more easily. So while sniffing alone won't get you high, sniffing before smoking can't hurt.
no you dont, unless you are sniffing the smoke. you have to ingest it (smoke it or eat it) for it to enter the blood stream and get you high
Not at all.
you snort it you dumbass
yeah sure, it's not like every girl is strictly going to stop at 16. Some stop growing at 17,18,19, and so on
Yeah let me just check my book on generalised questions with no quantifiable data available. Yes, you will grow 3 feet in the next 0.2 months.
A girl, likely done growing. If a boy, can have another growth spurt. Get an X-ray.
Is ur dad taller or mom? If both of ur parents short u might be.
maybe 1-2" taller
You will grow one more inch, so be patience.
I have tried other male enhancements and nothing seemed to work as well as these ones did. Within no time, I felt much larger, stronger and more confident. This ProlargentSize will make for some fun in the bedroom. I am really glad that I found these
Are you forgetting that you also inherit genes from your mother's side of the family. BTW, by definition... you aren't genetically related to your stepbrother. If you are genetically related... then he'd be a half brother.
its a bit late to worry about penis size now
have you made the most of those five inches in your 58 years........does your family go around measuring each others di cks
You may have female tendency or u could not measure dick of ur said relatives
LOL. no. By now you should know that... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Was your mother drinking or doing drugs while pregnant with you?
The average person a lot.Vampires/computer nerds very little.All the junk food is converted into vitamin D.
Some. But not too much.

one hour should do.
My friend lost sixty lbs one summer. He cut down on food. I know he lifted weights. I didn't know him at that time. I've seen him eat tuna, no mayo. He must have had a stringent diet plan and didn't intend to regain it. So, a few months is possible.
I am a tea lover. I drink green tea, black tea, follower tea, ice tea... This is my first time to drink herbal weight loss tea. The taste is not bad. I drink one cup everyday. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product did make me a little bit lighter. I will keep drinking it to see what happens to me in long run .
Figure three of four pounds a month. Any quicker & the weight will jump back on when you quit the diet.
months
Yes, women are usually safe in the USA throughout their lives, not just during their college days. But there can be situations anywhere that would make a woman unsafe. So as long as people use common sense, and avoid potentially dangerous situations, there should be no problem.
yes as long she stay with her brother/mom/cousin she safe
it depends on the woman does she keep herself safe?
safe from what
You would be given an anaesthetic for the surgery so you would feel nothing during the procedure. Once the initial anaesthetic wears off, there will be a degree of discomfort - but not real pain - for a few days as healing gets underway. This can usually easily be covered by the use of regular 'headache' tablets. The long term health and sexual benefits of being circumcised well outweigh the slight discomfort.
It is a bit painful but it wasn't excruciating. They numb the area with an anesthetic so the cuts feels like pinches. I got it done in my early 20s because it's easier to keep clean after the procedure. I'm 33 now and the scars are still there so that's something to think about; when you get it done later in life like I did, the scars don't go away. After the procedure, you are not really going to be able to walk around too much for about a week and you can't play sports or anything for about a month. I'm still glad I had it done.
Depends
Afterwards yes. During no. A lot of circumcisions go wrong and there are over 200 deaths a year in U.S.A. alone. Think about it. < M
i was a baby when cut
You should take advantage of that gift. Don't let the pressure of society get to you. Do not wear a bra, google for reasons why. I'm 17 and not exactly flat chested however my boobs doesn't buldge out in a obvious way. And it feels great to not having something cutting the circulation. Its not illegal however since you're 12 you'll probably get a lot of comments in highschool but who gives a **** when you feel awesome ;)
Don't worry about that right now. You could just be a late bloomer. Even if you stay flat chested, guys still love small boobs
Don't worry. I'm almost 15 and I'm flat chested. not like a B. I barley fit into an A and I have not started my period. Everyone's body is different.
It just feels like you are the only flat chested girl. I can guarantee you there are others. And they are all wondering the same thing. Be patient. You still have quite a few years of growing to do.
So is every other healthy normal girl your age. Be a child while you can. Too much oversexed television drama like De Grassi is ruining your young mind. Check back when you are 25. If it makes you feel better, late bloomers live longer. If that fails to ease your mind, remember the story you were told in kindergarten, "The Ugly Duckling".
i didn't even start puberty when i was 12. do you wear training bras? anyways, they take time to grow. just drink almond and soy milk. mine have grown really slow. i'm 15 in less than a month and finally got my period last month. tbh breast size isn't a big deal.
well you do not need a regular bra until you have something to put in the cups, they will go flat, but you might be able to get a padded one in your size, really though time will fix the problem, if they get too big you will miss these days
i was in the same situation a couple years ago. there's nothing wrong and all you need to do is wait it out, your chest will definitely grow soon. and honestly your mom is right about getting a bra
Buying a bra does not help them grow, at all. Are you sure your friends are massive, or are they just doing some creative padding? Something to consider.
Yes, it can still be pleasurable for her. My ex was well above average, 9 inches if not more. My current boyfriend is very below average. I wouldn't say the sex is not as good. It's just different. I enjoyed sex in my last relationship and I enjoy it now. It feels different, but it's a good different. My current boyfriends penis is able to hit different pleasure areas than my last boyfriend. I wouldn't be too insecure.
vaginas do not get loose, that is a myth. If that were true, no woman would enjoy sex after having children. Second of all, have you ever heard the phrase "Its not the size of it but how you use it"? That phrase is absolute truth. Learn how to please your partner. THAT is wayyyyyy more important than penis size. If you think your penis size is the only way to please a woman, then you (general you) don't know how to please her. So go slowly, ask her what she likes, and just have fun.
Yeah, birth control has a side effect. It prevents you from getting pregnant.
yes, although the pill of birth controls can help you avoid of being pregnant, but meanwhile, it is always a great side effect on your health body, such as: it can destroy your menstrual circulation, or you will have plenty of amounts during your periods. all of these are not a good result to your health body. then you should notice you should try your best not to take such pills of birth controls.
No. All medications have to be monitored for possible side affects when they are first put into studies. Those side affects are documented as POSSIBLE. when you get your prescription, you get an instruction sheet about these possible side affects. If they are severe, you can go back to your doctor, get on something else.
Not mechanical birth controls - and some women can take the chemical ones without any side effects. But often women can't take the pills - drives them nuts.
Yeah. But as far as side effects go, happiness and freedom aren't all that bad.
no; I took b.c. pills for years and never had a single problem. Loved them actually because I always knew the exact day and time my period would begin. No cramps, either.
All drugs have side effects
That is the objective.
Yes. Chicken is ideal.
What on earth is a "military diet"? Also, diets are notorious for not working, how about just eating healthy instead?
If it's the diet I think it is...no..no...no. Completely unhealthy and unsustainable and you're 13. You are still developing/growing - you do not need to be dieting.
No, it is a proven medical fact that circumcision provides a lifetime of health and sexual benefits with no drawbacks. Circumcision does NOT take away feeling from the penis.
Actually, not all circumcisions are the same, personally, they left me with some frenulum and extra moveable skin so under the head is still pretty pleasurable, it's the best of both worlds.
Hahah My husband had LOT of FUN with his di;;; with a circumsision 7 kids
no, not choking. I've been experiencing this for more than 10 years already. When I wake up in the morning, I am lying down straight. Something bothering in the stomach area.
I'm not a doctor. And there are many reasons for this, but... congestive heart failure, is the most common reason. Go get checked out by your primary care giver!
As if you're choking? I get that. Because I'm primarily left handed I sleep on my right side to keep the left hand free, not squished. Flat makes the spine feel uncomfortable. ~Aizen
are you overweight? large-breasted if female? that's extra weight on your lungs when you lie on your back
Maybe you have troubles with your ear
I'm getting married soon and have been dieting. I am starting a 6 week challenge to lose a few more inches and would just like a little advice on shedding that last bit of weight. I only drink water, I have no allergies, i generally have oats with honey for breakfast, salad or soup for lunch, fruits, vegetables or multigrain crackers with home made dips for snacks and eat a normal dinner (protein and vegetables. Maybe some carbs). I Have severe asthma so exercise can be a struggle but I'm working on it. Does anyone have any advice to help me lose those last few stubborn inches?
I think you should rock your body how it is. Your future husband loves you as you are. Eat healthy exercise for what you can and enjoy life. Life is to short to worry about an inch or two
Skip breakfast. No really, it won't make you fatter. A study find that people who skipped breakfast lost weight. See source for details.
You don't care about dying BECAUSE you are 15. We all felt immortal at your age. But when the Grim Reaper turns into reality it changes everything. Alcohol is an escape for you because you are an alcoholic or at least close to being one. Drinking per se is not a problem, but getting drunk is. Your liver is coping due to your age. Later on it will start to deteriorate. Then you will wish you had drank sensibly. Drinkers like smokers are addicts in denial. Unfortunately an early death is what often puts an end to it all.
Nothing does matter. You can't drive...so the world is safe. Once you start DRIVING...you are GOING TO DIE...good RIDDANCE and lets hope you DON'T KILL ANYONE while you slam your car into a TREE.
why does a 13-15 yr old need an escape like that and how are you getting alcohol? you are definitely affecting your brain development and probably growth
Honey, you don't get the kickback right now. You get it when you're older, and the damage to your body is already done and can't be reversed.
At your age you should smoking more drugs than drinking, try and turn this around.
because your brain is not in your control when you are drunken and you could do anything.EVEN KILLING SOMEONE!!!
Conservatism is a mental disorder.
Yes many illnesses have had changed categories some because of the treatments used and some because of knowledge recently about them others because some become lumped categories. Autism was once just called hyper activity now its not, a manic depressant was once called schizophrenic, we know today gang members who are young have behavioral problems and some are predators sexually while being bi-sexual. Bi-polar is still the catch all lumped category.
Yes, Catechangia
No, but asking a question in the wrong category is a form of laziness.
It's needed because some people are too stupid to do this simple task.
It's usually people who cant handle facts. (liberals).
Possibly some pain and swelling but if you're concerned you also have the option of actually going to the doctor 😷
You would be told by your doctor after examination and appropriate testing.
Please see your doctor. Testicular cancer is easy to treat when diagnosed early.
Self diagnosis is usually wrong.
If you went to the doctor
Believe that you don't, then you won't.
IT HURT !!!!
Depends on how much you exercise. Past societies used to walk everywhere they went and labored in fields for 14 hours a day. Few ever saw the ripe old age of 40+. The poison is in the dose. Moderation is the key. Food is not medicine.
No mankind was on a high fat diet for thousands of years. The present cholesterol scare was started by the drug companies who did the research in regard to cholesterol. They have been selling cholesterol lowering drugs for the past 50 years, without any significant decrease in stroke or heart disease. Heart related issues is still the #1 killer in the U.S. Capitalism has no conscience and it never will.
No. It has been proven that it is carbs - all carbs - that cause those problems. I was just reading a blog about this! It is on a channel on Disqus called Low carb Living. This channel has several articles that discuss the advantages of eating low carb, high fat diets. Here is one of them: https://disqus.com/home/channel/lowcarbl...
depends on which so-called authority you ask......the best oils are the palm and coconut oil, and real butter......but premature aging....sounds like more scare tactics
Of course it would and give you a heart attack. All your arteries would be clogged up.
Dog abuse is now a Class A Felony. You're going to be a jail bird for a few years. don't turn off you computer, we can trace your IP address & have an Animal Control Officer at your door in just a matter of a few minutes. Stay on the computer. Do not turn your computer off.
So is you don't know if your dogs alive? Still most people with a heart cared for their animals from day one to the very end. Now you want to eat your dog? If you have a family be sure to tell them they're having Sparky for dinner tonight! See how they react to that.
Eating dog meat is accepted in some societies, but trolling isn't accepted in any.
It depends. I mean it depends on the mental health of the dog. In any case, there is no harm in your consulting a professionally qualified doctor about your genuine doubts like this.
You are insane. You will be in jail. Must be really mental 😬 But that's none of my business 😑
hi i think you have a supermarket where you can buy apples and bread, why the hell would you WANT TO EAT YOUR GODDAMN DOG JESUS

No. Many people who say they are depressed are just in a neutral mood but do not recognize it.
I would say that some amount of depression has become the norm in the USA. Because the level of toxicity in the world is such that it's depressing everyone's physical functioning to some degree--to say nothing of the lack of nutrients in most people's diets, and other factors as well.
Everybody has times of sadness. Clinical depression is only found in about 25% of the population and is partially caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain.
In a way. But its normal. It becomes a problem when you have too much too often
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.

Stop eating. A healthy person living in a comfortable home and with water could fast for a month without too much trouble. I know people that have fasted for forty days with no visible ill effects. Drink water whenever you want - there are no calories in it. If fasting, I recommend a multivitamin every 2 or 3 of days. If you feel sick to your tummy sometimes, take an antacid like Tums. You should be able to lose about a half pound each day of fasting, plus 6 to 8 pounds of water weight during the first 4 to 7 days. The water weight will come back just as quickly when the diet is over.
So you plan to pass out at the wedding? Because any fast way will make you sick for the wedding. Just what you want. Don't be a fool. It's called unhealthy for a reason.
Fast weight loss can cause gall bladder problems. There should be no vacation from health habits.
BUY VERY RESTRICTED FOOD. A GREAT IDEA IS TO PUT A SELECTED AMOUNT OF FOOD WHICH AMOUNTS TO A LOW CALORIE INTAKE, INTO A BOX AND JUST EAT OUT OF THAT. ANOTHER WAY IS TO NOT THINK ABOUT EATING UNTIL MIDDAY OR LATER SO THAT YOUR METABOLISM DOESN'T KICK AND AND MAKE YOU CRAVE FOOD.
Don't fall into cardiac arrest.
I really want to start cutting my calories. because I am near obese, cutting them drastically should not hurt me. However, in the past when I cut calories I would lose weight , but when I started eating normally , I would gain the weight back , plus more. I want to cut my calories and lose weight , but im afraid that once I stop , I will gain it back and keep getting bigger and bigger. I dont want to repeat the cycle. What should I do?
Cutting calories is good but you can't just lose weight by cutting your calories. You have to constantly excersice to lose fat. Because if you just cut calories, your body isn't used to you not eating as much as before so it starts making more fat to support the body.
Are you adding in ANY exercise to any of this? It's a whole body thing to lose and keep the weight off.
Yes, of course. Since when you eat "normally" you are obese, you go back to gaining weight when you eat "normally", because your normal intake is way too much. You need to learn to eat the right way and make permanent sustainable changes to your diet.
I had a red spot on my left breast for about a month and I thought it was from a bite, but it is not itchy and feels like a bump. I did put anti itch cream on it and somehow it went down and went away and know the redness has return and it is still not itchy. I am not sure if it is cancer, but I hope it is not because I just lost my mother to breast cancer(she was 51) and I am very concern and I am only 21.
If you are concerned, see a doctor. Your regular doctor should be made aware of your family medic a l history and can guide you about any increased risk. What you are describing sounds nothing like breast cancer.
Oh dear, sweetie we are so sorry to hear of this. Of course you are worried it could be cancer. We know you are a smart girl/young woman and know that you need to go see your doctor or even better, call your mother's oncologist ok? We will wait for an update to let us know what you found out.
Doesn't sound anything like cancer. See your doctor. It is likely a simple skin condition. Cancer does not shrink down and go away.

Why haven't you seen a doctor?
No. There is no scientific evidence that any food, including cottage cheese, can affect the progress of cancer in any way. What you describe is the Budwig diet. People like Johanna Budwig make wild and unproven claims and exploit the desperation of vulnerable people. Anyone who follows Johanna Budwig's recommendations will be investing time, money and hope in something that is not effective, as well consuming quantities of not very enjoyable food.
No and that's one of the most ignorant things I've ever heard
i doubt it you need doctors to deal with cancer
NOPE
no
No.
The sperm must enter the egg, not rip it apart by being large.

Wow... seriously?
The question you need to ask yourself is why do you stand in a hot shower for a long time when you know it causes vertigo? The vertigo is normal in this situation. What's not normal is to keep doing this when you know it causes problems. The fix is simple - shorter showers and cooler water.
Go get checked for horizontal vertigo. I have it. If I look up or tilt head back the room spins. I body wash too afraid I will fall in shower. Do a test tilt your head back if you get dizzy or room spins that is a major sign of vertigo.
It sounds like you are using way too hott of water and staying in way longer than you should..i know if i use too hott of water and stay in the shower too long it raises my blood pressure too high and makes me feel faint and dizzy soo please dont use such hott water and dont stay in as long..its dangerous to do that because it raises your blood pressure high so please be careful and use warm water not hot and dont stay in as long..
Your blood pressure is going through the roof. Cut the shower time down, it's obvious it is harming you.
get out after 10 minutes.

you are overheating your body (not to mention wasting water and energy)

It's too hot. Duh.
No it's about 3 inches inside or more
it's right inside near the opening where your fingers can reach it

look at medical pictures you can find then on google, it is covering entrance of vagina
Height is greatly determined by genetics so there's not much you can do. Don't go into growing supplements, they won't work, but there's stuff that you can do to add one or two inches to your predetermined height. Your bones need calcium, magnesium and phosphorus. Foods high in that will help. Get a good amount of exercise and get lots of sleep.
No such thing. If you haven'tt eaten right (ie from a famine area, anorexia) when younger, too late once your puberty has begun. Of course most of us in the west have enough fats/proteins to reach our fiull height anyway. Over 80% of height is genetic.
They are all equally useless. Growth hormone injections from a doctor are the only thing. But after about 13/14 they have minimal effect. Don't buy those scam snake oils sold by frauds.
There are none.
Find his weight and height by asking. Tell him to use a BMI calculator or to ask his Dr.
If you think they're over-weight they probably are.
You put down the phone and look at him.
How can it be a secret?
You know where unmarried women are basically not allowed to leave the house without a male escort usually one of her relatives.I watched an anti Islam video about this and the statics seemed pretty exaggerated but I could image it must be somewhat true.Much more so than in European countries I would think where people have freedom.
there might be a few instances,, but in Islam, our prophet Mohammed actually encourages us to marry distantly and not from family to purify the blood
No. It's a Western spread myth. Blond hair and blue eyes are actually from inbreeding. The blue eyes and blond hair gene is recessive. Also, predominantly Muslim countries and genetically diverse as they have many different races of people.
Islam itself doesn't encourage inbreeding but it doesn't prohibit it either (I'm not talking about inbreeding between siblings). Although Muhammad encouraged Muslims to marry from outside their relatives, his daughter Fatimah married his first cousin Ali, so some may see that as setting an example. That said, inbreeding is really a cultural problem usually practiced in societies that still hold unto the tribal system.
First cousin marriages are very common among Pakistani muslims. As a result, children born to such marriages have a much higher chance of having birth defects and/or serious congenital illnesses than the general population. This is true within Pakistan itself and in the Pakistanii ghettoes in Europe. The statistics tell the story. It is, of course, rarely mentioned in the mainstream media for fear of offending the Pakistani muslims.Or you can believe danny/ar, because he is a scientist after all. He's told us so.
It's not really a major practice except among the more conservative Muslims who do it only because it's snnah since Mohammed did it first. However, it is becoming a growing problem among all Muslim Communities that are becoming inbred because of their "marry only Muslim" policy. In a way, Islam is doing everything it can to wipe itself out, like with their insane inter sect murdering etc, which is good for the rest of the world because, otherwise, they would b more focused on wiping us out.
I have taken medication for my depression for years and it usually helps, but lately I have been so depressed and I don't know what to do. I can't make enough money to support my family so my wife works full time, my marriage is on the rocks, my addiction is on the brink of taking my life back (been clean for a year but now I'm on the edge), I don't know what to do. I go to church every week and pray regularly. It doesn't seem to help. Everyday we get more and more into debt with no end in sight. I'm so done
If you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow and somebody said "How many arrows do you want?" what would you say? Would you say, "Which one is the best arrow?" or "How many arrows can I have?" If you read the list in my Questions page - under my post DEPRESSION TREATMENTS - you might be amazed at how many things based on scientific evidence -that cost little or nothing - that have little or no risk - can help depressed people. That's the beauty of complementary treatments - the way you can combine them.
Nothing beats depression like--exercising. Do you run at all or workout at all? After work go for a bikeride or a run. Being on medication is one thing, but I find that if I don't work out my anxiety builds. You will feel better, be healthier and feel less stressed. Good luck.
Easy. Don't you watch Peter Pan? "For you to be able to fly, THINK HAPPY THOUGHTS." also, seek for help. Like your parent and friends. And if for some reason you cannot tell them what your problem is, then tell GOD. PRAY TO HIM. SEEK FOR HELP AND HE WILL HEAR YOU AND HELP YOU. Once you pray, and seek help to him, all that deep depression that you are feeling that is letting you feel miserable, will be gone. God will replace it will just pure JOY and love that you have never felt before. TRUST ME, I HAVE EXPERIENCE IT. 💕
you need to get off the meds...they're not helping you, you need vitamins and minerals to help your body heal itself, and you need to do a search for a naturopathic physician in your zipcode, then look on yelp, doctors grades and thumbtack...thumbtack has a nice preview feature to target the exact area you need help with....way better than just walking in off the street cold call.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
I don't know, why do people who drive cars think it's alright to drive around people walking or riding bikes? Driving like smoking is not a true necessity when a person can walk or ride a bike, yet those exhaust emissions that we breath everyday are 1000 times more poisonous than cigarettes and lets the population become severely overweight because it promotes laziness.
Smokers are inconsiderate @$$holes who don't care about other people or their families. We'd be better off without them
some of the smokers are out there. Most are not
No because smoking messes with your head and every other bodily function.
ha, try this one. i'm always putting out their fires they start with their tossed butts.
Not that I have known. Sadly they can care less.
Yes. fillings shouldn't be a problem to get braces.
Fillings have nothing to do with braces.
Of course you can
Sounds like you're over obsessing about this. Masturbation is fun, enjoyable and relaxing. But there are other things in life. Get out and live kid!
Slow down, relax, let go, and deep breathe. It can take a while to get the hang of it, 'cos the tendency is to tense and speed up, but if you gradually persist, you'll notice the difference it makes to your orgasm.
Just try masturbating using different hands, in different positions, and thinking about different things.
Try doing it some buddies or close cousins pretty fun experience to do it with others who are open to it gives us more of a adrenaline feeling
Use a fleshlight
ask dad
No. when your body is starving, your brain kicks into survival mode and your body hold onto any weight it can in order to keep you alive. This is an ancient Human instinct. If you do lose any weight at all, as soon as you start eating again your brain will sense that there's food available again, and trigger your body to eat all you can in order to re gain the weight you lost, and some more on top of it just in case you starve again. The way to lose weight is to keep your body nourished with enough healthy food to keep you going, but not more than you need.
Definitely not the best approach. Don't obsess over losing weight. The process of weight loss is gradual and there aren't any immediate results. So start by gradually changing your diet. Don't go from a whatever-i-feel-like diet to all fruits and vegetables over night because that will throw your body off. Slowly start cutting out junk food and replacing it with more healthful, but still good tasting food.
Yeah but you'll screw up your metabolism. Then you'll gain the weight. Everything you eat after starving, you will store as fat. Even healthy foods. Don't be lazy. Instead workout and eat healthy. You do not want to develop an eating disorder. I noticed you said you want to lose a bit just for an event? If you starve, just ask yourself, will you have energy to attend this event? Most likely not. Five chips? You would be better off eating a healthy food like an apple. Don't starve. You will screw up your metabolism then when you really wanna lose weight, it'll be almost impossible. You'll have to work twice as hard. Stay safe.
If you starve yourself for a week you will regain more than you lost. For the rest of your life your new weight will be higher. Ask yourself carefully if it will be worth that. Okay, having settled the more important issue that you will gain weight later, i'll answer your question - You will lose weight for that week. Then you will prompted again back every gram and then some.
Yes, but you'll have to drink a lot of water (the recommended is 8 cups a day). I've done it, but it also depends on how active you are. Let's just say you are sedentary for that week, you'll probably lose about roughly 5 lbs
Please please don't do this!! Yes you will lose weight but you will lose a lot of things on top of this, I.e. Your hair, energy and eventually you won't be able to carry out everyday things like socialising. It sounds silly but trust me!! If you want to lose weight then eat healthy and do lots of exercise!! I suffered from anorexia and I'm still in recovery, and I'm telling you now, that first time I decided to lose a 'little bit' of weight was probably the worst decision I've ever made!!
You might but when you start eating again you'll gain more because when you're body is deprived of food metabolism slows down so when you do decide to eat those calories, fat ect will stick to you more. This is why you should eat healthy but things through out the day and drink a lot of water. Green tea plain is good too
This question is honestly so dumb and offensive, especially to those who suffer from eating disorders. You will lose your friends, family, happiness and hobbies. You might lose weight but eventually you'll end up in the hospital and be forced to gain it all back with an NG Tube up your nose. You'll be tired cold and weak and have blue nails and dead eyes and won't be able to make it up the stairs.
I did this after thanksgiving except it was 6 days- I pretty much lost the food weight I gained from thanksgiving ie the water weight plus maybe like 2-3 extra lbs. not recommended though
I enjoy sex but no, I do not want to see someone masturbating in public, especially if my family is with me. I think that all things sexual should be done in private.
Yeah, if it is done privately where I cannot be seen- enjoy communing with nature, hiking nude and so an occasional round of solo sex out in the woods or on a mountain is relaxing and enjoyable.
Yes especially when women catch me masturbating
i prefer to do it at home
Don't kill yourself. Things can get better. Tell your boyfriend. Talking usually helps. I write from experience.
Yes. You should speak to your boyfriend and tell him you are not the happy person you put on a front for.
Dont do it. Its not worth it honey. Just tell your boyfriend! If he's not helping you then its time for you yo leave! Cheer up... :)
Don't know, that's up to you. Yes.
dont ever harm yourself. trust me its not worth it. your bf may be able to help you. speak to him asap :)
stand in-front of a train? i dont know
ye they should??!
Brush but schedule a good dental exam and cleaning. That way you are not brushing on top of built up tartar or calculus and then never able to brush below the hardened plaque and therefore that could become a cavity w/o a dental exam and cleaning. But do brush and floss and use mouth rinse too.
You need to go to a dentist to have them professionally cleaned and checked. Not brushing your teeth can lead to a lot of other infections in your body, including an infection in your heart. Brush your teeth daily to keep healthy.
I kinda hope this is a joke, but considering our society you never know. to answer your question, they will definitely get better, but if you're expecting them to get pearly white, I'm sorry but it's not gonna happen. you can always try teeth whitening kits or professionally get them whitened. (by the way, if this isn't a joke for the sake of everyone around you, please brush your teeth, I'm sure they don't like to smell bad breath.)
No, they are probably stained now. By not brushing, soda and acidic foods can erode the enamel and make them become discolored over time.
They could come back to normal but it definitely gonna take lots of time. But why should you leave your teeth unbrush for 2years?
Yeah. Your teeth should return back to white color.
YOU DIDNT BRUSH URE TEETH FOR 2 YEARS?!?
You're completely f*cked
troll smh
Underwear lint. TP.
You are supposed to chew spaghetti, not just swallow them!
i am not sure. ask a doctor

Hi I m 13 and have had acne since I was 9. I m a very self conscious person and I hate having spots. I ve tried lots of things like creams and I ve even been to the doctors about it but nothing seems to help. Has anyone got any ideas of what could actually help. Also I have marks from previous spots on my checks that won t go, any ideas of how I can get them to fade. Thanks
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I had acne from 14 to 23 years of age almost a decade. I know what you are going through, I finally got rid of it when I started using a lotion called bevoline by skin divine. I recommend that you stop using any other product that you are using and get this lotion immediately.
Can't really tell without seeing. However, I can say that many std's can be treated if detected early. If you think it is serious, I wouldn't hesitate to see a doctor.
Lol, if it's immediately after it's not likely an STD. See a doctor though, and from now on use safe sex only. They have mouth condoms true story.
dont suck willys its bad
My husband just found out that he has Type 2 Diabetes. We tested his blood sugar at home. 2 Hours after eating his reading was around 514....we don't have insulin yet because we have to see the DR for the follow up appointment because we just got the results a few days ago.. Since we don't have any insulin should we take him to the hospital? -47 year old male
As I answer this, it's been 15 minutes since you asked. So test the blood again. If his sugar is higher, go to the ER. If it's lower, try some moderate exercise and drinking water. ONLY water, no juice or soda or even milk! If it's not a whole lot lower, then go to the ER. People can and do die of high blood sugar, so yes, it's an emergency situation, and yes, your insurance should cover an ER visit. Insurance probably won't cover an ambulance ride, though. I'm really surprised that the doctor didn't give him some pills. Most doctors will try pills before insulin in middleaged patients.
Call your primary care doctor.
yes, you should go to the ER.
Wear a loose nightshirt. I'd be worried about someone walking in on me. But it's definitely a good idea to sleep with no bra.
Yes actually!, and as well as slip off your underwear too! and go commando!. its actually recommended to not wear a braw when you sleep, and as we'll to not wear underwear, why? the braw because you need your breast to have some time to bread, and not be chocked 24-7 by the braw, and same thing for your vagina(vulva), it lets it bread, and not clutter up with moisture, which can be bad
Yes
I don't see why not. All I wear to bed is a loose pair of boxer shorts, unless I'm having my period, then I wear undies.
yes it is fine also best to sleep naked to air every thing out. noting wrong with it, if company is there than I wouldn't do it .
Yes, of course. Just have a shirt handy nearby in case of emergency (fire, etc.).
Yesss!
Yes just make sure your curtains are pulled & lock the door to your room
Yes you can as long as nobody walks in on you it will be just fine.
It is more healthy to. I don't but my best friend does all the time.
It's not bad, but it is a bit odd. How would you feel if you were told you couldn't sleep with it? If you feel quite distressed at the thought of not having the blanket, then you might need some help.
You're fone
It's fine. you are not hurting anyone.
If you look at it from your mental health point of view. Otherwise, it is okay for me.
The color of your pee has no effect on when your period is due. Thehe color of your pee is related to how well your body is hydrated. If your pee is a lighter color it means you are well hydrated, if your pee is a dark yellow color you need to be drinking.more water
No, it's because you drank more water so the germs are pretty much clear and clean.
no it means you're drinking lots of water which is a good thing!
No just that you are drinking plenty of water.
No. It simply means you are well hydrated as you should be.
no... if your pee is turning more clear and less yellow, it just means that you are more hydrated :)
You're at a crucial age in development, things like hormonal changes will effect your judgement. It's natural to feel a sense of uncertainty in one's self image but at the end of the day it only matters that your comfortable with yourself. If you have some concerns about your weight, in either direction, talk to someone close or a family doctor, they will be able to help you and put your mind at rest.
Your not fat, your 13, your a teenager and maybe starting/getting ready to go thru (puberty) not to worry we all experience it, it's part of life and growing up. Your going to loose the baby fat, get hair in your armpits, voice is going to change, you'll get taller and smell. Hang in there you'll be okay little man.
5'1 = 1m55, 105 lbs = 47.6 kg 47.6/1.55^2 = 19.8 This BMI is a tiny bit below the normal range (20 to 25), so you're a bit underweight.
You are not overweight. If you don't like the shape of your body, consider doing some type of exercise (running, cycling, push-ups, pull-ups, squats, burpees, sit-ups, weights, etc.) to build muscle and firm areas you feel are fat.
No, that is definitely not fat. You are at a perfect weight for your age and height. Stop worrying about weight. Pay attention to being fit and healthy and strong.
You're at a very healthy weight. Your body image is distorted. Don't turn this into an eating disorder trying to diet away imaginary flaws.
Not even remotely close to even being considered fat in any way shape or form. Sorry but your family is correct.
that is very small
Are you sure it's not blood in your urine? If it is, it's nothing to be alarmed about - it's probably a urinary tract infection. Any of us can get these at any time. Some people think they are caused because of sex, but no, this isn't true. They are caused by bacteria which can enter our urethra and cause issues. See a doc. We need to be on antibiotics when we have a urinary tract infection... get checked, just in case
When you start the pill some women get a side effect called breakthrough bleeding. It is likely that. Normally your doctor will ask you to wait a few weeks to see if it will just go away by itself. After that your doctor will try to stop it by changing the way you take your pill, or change to a different pill. Take care!
most likely bb - how long have you been on the pill? If you are concerned call your prescribing doctor or the nurse.
consult to a doctor
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Call a suicide hotline instead.
Call the suicide hotline. We all know your trying to kill yourself....

A gun or a high place is good but please don't do it.
depends i guess on how aware you are?? i was suffering from ocd for years and i just didn't realize it was abnormal/had a name until i went to see a doctor, so i mean if you're aware then you'd recognize something's wrong but diagnosing it right off the bat probably isn't too safe
Go see a doctor
Diagnosis.
No
This isn't funny. Gerara here man.
Your doctor would have explained how to control it with medication? what stage are you at and which one of the several medications for aids have you been given and how often do you have to go for checkups?

As you age and mature, you will eventually find the right girl for you. Probably in college. But first deal with your depression.-------- Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
It sounds like you are going through a lot and it can be overwhelming to control your emotions. Sometimes it helps to take some deep breaths and listen to music. Thank you so much for reaching out! It takes a great deal of courage to be able to tell people how you feel. I would consider seeking professional help like a therapist, school counselor, teacher or a psychiatrist. Talk to a family member that can help you talk about your feelings. Please know that you are not alone! If you would like to discuss this further reach out to a Crisis Hotline in your area and speak with a trained counselor by phone, chat, text or email. NK, Counselor
Anything that works is called medicine, not "alternative." There are no "natural" cures for any cancer. There are medicines that have been derived from nature (I.e., taxanes originated from the bark of a yew tree), but as far as nonsense like diet, exercise, water, magic oils, etc ... that's all quackery.
There is nothing. With medical treatment, people can live quite a long time.
no
I am afraid at 18 you need to be an adult. Most men are finished at that age. A few late bloomers may get a bit taller but there is no way you will be the height you 'want.' Height is genetic and nothing you do can influence that
You might get a little taller, but it is no likely. There are no foods you can eat that would help, and nothing else you can do about it either. Your height is determined by your genetics.
Not likely, you've run out of time. But it is possible I suppose. Males typically reach their final height by age 18 or 19. There are no Foods or anything else you can do that will make you grow taller than your genetically programmed to be. You can't change your height.
No chance. You've stopped for good now. Nothing you can do. Don't get scammed.
You may buy a cow to drink milk - it will not help at all. LOL Get x-rays and ask your doc if your growth plates are closed. That is all you can do... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
at 18. not likely
That's a bit weird. It does happen, but I would assume that you would have seen it before. Maybe he found some old condoms and decided to be creative since you two don't use them any more. That's a bit weird, but it's much more believable than him bringing another woman into your house and leaving the condom in the trash can to be found.
Yes they do... and in socks, and banana peels, and anything else they can thing of that approximates (however distantly) a vagina. Vacuums... but if your husband (he he) is going to try this one make sure he leaves the hose on it! A couple of guys didn't know that there is a strong fan inside and, well, now we call them Stumpy.
Yes they do. In England it's called a posh ****. Enjoy!
I did it a few times as a young man to see what it felt like...but not any more. Sounds kinda fishy to me.
From what i understand my dad used to...seems weird to me too. However...wrappers plural...gonna have to go with the dude having sex.
Yes it makes you last longer and increases the orgasm
You don't even have a husband kid.
I've just been for a mental health assessment as my GP suspected that I had bipolar disorder. However, the mental health nurse has just basically told me that all my problems (which consist of me feeling so down I don't want to be here anymore to feeling so high I can do anything I want) are down to my mum and dad splitting up 7 years ago and I just need counselling. I really want to go for a second opinion. What would you do?
Try counseling and get a second opinion. A lot of people go in thinking they have this mental imbalance that needs chemicals to fix and sometimes they do. Others just need to be given the right mental tools to deal with certain things.
how is your diet? I'll bet your GP never asked ?! right? a naturopathic physician knows diet and health and who to see for the rest of the story, simply do a search in your zipcode compare comments in yelp and doctors grades then make appt ....best wishes
I'd get a second opinion. Your mood swings sound like text book bipolar behavior to me!
You are more lucky then you realize. Meds can really mess you up yet most doctors hand them out like candy. If they are offering you counseling take it as it works.
I looked up symptoms online for social anxiety, and I fit almost every single one. I know that I should go to some sort of Doctor to get diagnosed, but I don't know how to ask my parents because they will probably tell me that I definitely don't have one because I never act anxious in front of them and that I haven't told them anything before this
It's not something a shrink can fix. You'll have to find coping mechanism. Try CBT.
The tests online are designed to make you think you need meds as it is big pharma that designed them. Practice meditation instead. http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe....
Be polite and give them due respect.
No. It can't be cured or even (currently) slowed down. It progresses at different speeds in different people. But it will progress and there's no way to stop it or reverse its effects.
Other than antibiotics, prescription drugs only treat symptoms, the don't cure diseases.
Not currently. If fact, we still don't even know Why it happens.
Sadly, no. There are some things that might slow it down, but for now it is always worsening and permanent.

There is very noticeable increase in bloodflow to the genitals. So erection is very strong, long. My girl friend was shocked on my performance . I have a secret which make me powerful. I will order new bottle of Prolargentsize capsule from Prolargentsize
These Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pills work well. my husband usually comes home from work and complains that he is too tired for anything. but in the last week these have been helping lot. He wants to have fun every night and is now bugging me to have sex.
Just forget the incident , she was in a hurry to avoid messing the room. As you are in your teens erection is common , just jack off after she left the closet room . Regards.
Next time put plastic wrap around the toilet seat.
she probably wanted to make sure the nightshirt did not get dirty from the dump- it it was that urgent, probably came out explosively.
ever thought of turning your back and not looking?
Use your search engine and look up "prostrate massage".
You Don't.
Get psychiatric help bro.
shouldnt be hard to figure out
It is a but unusual for a boy to start puberty at that age. Although rare it can happen. It might be advisable to have his doctor check his physical development. Particularly his testosterone level. Such instances of very early puberty can cause physical as well as emotional and behavioral problems having to deal with sex. For some detailed information check the website below.
That's early puberty. Does that run in your family? If not, you may want to have him examined by your doctor. Precocious Puberty can cause other problems, such as reduced height. Not to mention that he may become very mature physically, while still a child. Read the attached link and do scuss with your pediatrician. You may not need to do anything in particular, other than having that talk with your son a bit earlier than you planned.
If you're his dad, ask him if he's getting hair on his nuts and above his dick'. If he just turned 9, I'd probably ask a doctor about it. If he's almost 10, I don't think I'd worry much about it, but a doctor opinion wouldn't hurt. You mentioned a growth spurt, but didn't say how tall he is. That's important.
Yep = it is possible. Not "normal" but unless he has obvious problems I don't see what doctor should do. You may need to give him "the Talk" at 10, as he will be way ahead of SexEd at school.. most boys however cope. If he is growing now, he may get ahead of the early bone closure problem too. < M
Could be but that is way early you may want to take him to the doctor and get checked out.

It does seem to be happening more and more, these days. His paediatrician can confirm it, if there's any doubt on your part.
should be very uncommon but no impossible
I've been masturbating since I was 13. Now I'm 21. I used to have much pleasure in masturbating. But Nowadays I don't find the same pleasure I used to have once and also I feel like I'm losing sex appetite along with sex power. Is it a sign of impotence? Am I becoming an impotent? Btw, when I was on my teen age, I masturbated almost everyday then it lessened to 4 days in a week, then 3 days in a week, after then 2 days, NOW its only once in 3 weeks! I'm getting a little bit of worried about my sex life. P.S: I'm still a virgin guy.
No it can't. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
same as eating ice cream.....once in awhile its great..........every day it becomes routine
of course not
I usually take a break from whatever I was doing in that moment, pray, and go outside. I also will call someone and talk, exercise, or do something I enjoy. Recently mine has been worse due to personal reasons. (work, family, etc.) I started taking some classes such as piano and singing lessons and it really gives my mind something positive to look forward too.
Learn distress tolerance. Normally I would tell you to go to a doctor but I know you won't and it's late and I find I just can't care anymore.
Oh, please! This is like you are saying....."I have a really bad infection and it is out of control and I don't want medication! Does anyone know anything that helps manage my infection better?" Answer: Hell, no! See your doctor!
Meditation. But you have to be patient and practice very often at first.
Exercise, mindfulness. The drugs are no good for you. Good luck.

Yes, you can get a false tooth or a crown to replace the one that decayed.
Yes. You can either have a dental implant or get a bridge, which is a false tooth.
Yes, but it is very expensive. Brush & floss your teeth daily so you don't have to deal with it. Also, dentures aren't as good to chew with as your real teeth and implants have their drawbacks too.
Yes you can
Not until all your teeth are gone
I just figured out my dog has tapeworm. He sleeps with me every night (until I realized he had tapeworm). This morning I found some of the "rice" looking dead tapeworm things in my bed (gross I know). Am I at risk for getting some kind of disease or tapeworm even? I really don't know much about tapeworm and I can't get ahold of my vet. Any help would be great.
Could be Flea pupae or other intestinal parasites. Your veterinarian can help prevent, *accurately* diagnose and safely treat parasites and other health problems that not only affect your dog or cat, but also the safety of you and your family.
I'm a 14 year old boy and I'm 5'3 almost 5'4 and I was wondering if I will grow to atleast 6 feet. A lot of my boy relatives are like 6'2 or something. My dad is about 5'9. I don't know if I've been growing fast cuz just two years ago I was about 4'11. So is it possible for me to be 6 feet?
Is it possible? Yes. Will you? No one knows. https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index... At 14 and 5' 3", you are somewhat below the average. You could hit 6' but the odds aren't in your favor but it's not impossible.
Unlikely as your father is average. Maybe a little more. You'll stop round 16.
Hugely unlikely. Your dad is 5'9" and unless your mother is well over 6' chances are that you'll be around his size.
No way to tell. Most guys are similar in height to their dad.
If you're just entering puberty, that wouldn't be unusual. Average adult erect size is about 5". Don't worry about it, any more than you worry about the size of your big toe. Just enjoy being yourself. Never compare. It's pointless to worry about something that's not a problem and can't be changed even if it was.
Normal for 13. Growing rapidly and will get to adult size by 14-15.
thats normal at 14 it will be 4 inches at 15 it will be 5 inches etc etc
Normal. Most growth will be over the next few years for you.
If it doesn't grow it's small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Yep. That's about right. < M
Yes, that is completely normal for your age.
Call 911 bloody stools indicate some internal bleeding.
an ambulance ride is going to cost a ton of money. tell him he has signs of internal bleeding.. if he does not go with you to the hospital then you are going to call an ambulance.
I've never heard smoking causes stomach bleeding. It is something else.
Yes, you should, but be aware, they cannot treat him or take him to the hospital unless he agrees to go. He really does NEED to go, but will he allow it ??? Good luck.
Cane sugar is bad for your teeth. fruit is good for your teeth.
As a dentist, I get asked a lot about sugar. But as it turns out, sugar isn’t actually the worst thing for your teeth. Sugar also isn’t the cause of tooth decay; acid is. The most cavity-causing food is crackers and breads, not candy. http://www.femaleadda.com/dental-care
Perfect teeth? You need to expose yourself to more third-world people.
sugar is sugar if your don;t brush your teeth
fruit has sugar in it. the only difference is the concentration.

depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain does not produce sufficient Serotonin--- Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.

We ve recently moved in to the same room and I don t have the same privacy as before. I ve tuned 18 last month and he s 11. We live in Arizona so I often also sleep naked because of the heat, especially in the summer. Should I be concerned about this? Also there is very little privacy when it comes to taking care of "business" at night. How should I handle this? Thanks for the help in advance.
Just sleep naked and he'll assume that it's OK. Because it is OK. As to other activities, be a good bro and take care of your business elsewhere. That's not OK.
sleeping naked in the same room as your bro is fine. At 11, he's getting b0ners, too, so if he sees yours, don't sweat it, But jackin' off .private.
Your brother might know how to masturbate as well therefore theres no more excuses. But if he doesnt then talk to him about that. Sometime he will figure that out and theres no need to be embarass about. After all you will do that same thing.
Well you can sleep nude he likely has seen you before. You might find that he begins sleeping nude also to imitate you etc. As far as masturbation he is currently old enough to do so and if he happens to notice or catch you at it then tell him about it.
You could just say to him, hey bro' it's too hot to sleep with jammies on. Do you mind if I go naked in bed? Assuming he doesn't freak out, then do so. If he's a bit uncomfortable, then get undressed down to your boxers/undies, hop in bed, and slide them off. Tuck them under your pillow. In the morning, get up nude to go to the bathroom. See what happens. :D
Your brothers it's normal. Atleast he won't grow up insecure about nudity.
Well, at 11, he is probably asking exactly same question. I would carry on as normal and see what he does. < M
nope, you'll became used very fast to see each other naked. not a deal (unless you are fanatic religious...)
Lube
My guess is that your body just has to adjust. But, you might consider talking to your doctor. He is bound the doctor-patient relationship not to tell anyone.
try using lubricant it will make it much more comfortable for you
HAHAHAHAHAH! Aint Karma a BI****. Too late now. For better of for worse, in sickness and in health. Take your vows seriously. You wanted Out, and this is what you got. I am sure your wife is not that stupid to reunite with YOU after you went out and got yourself a new Fiance. Good Luck with that.
If the divorce is final it is final. If it is not final it can be stopped. Why would your wife want you back anyway as you clearly are not responsible?
I don't believe your story. But I had friends that got divorced and when they got back together again they had to get remarried.
It's unlikely your former wife would want you back. If she did, there's something wrong with her. No one wants to be second best and that's what she is to you.
If your wife has any sense she will kick your butt from here to next week and back again ..
Really lame troll....... seriously, is that the best you got? How about you work out some details before trying this on.
The only answer I can give you is: You're an idiot.
You are a soulless bastard. You deserve to be alone
You are a heartless piece of sh;;;;i;;;;t;;;;;t and if your wife take you back she is crazy
You are leaving your fiance because she has cancer, you are a horrid horrid person.
Yes, eventually getting to the point where your brain will say 'to hell with this' and toss enough erotic dreams at you to do the job. Less masturbation also improves sperm-count to an extent, and increases the volume of semen.
Definitely.
It's possible.
if done properly, it should relive stress and horniness

My height right now is 5 foot 7 inches (1.70m) I consider myself a pretty short boy, i am 16 and a half, and I hate my height because I want to play basketball again, I stopped going to basketball clubs and just playing for fun because of some wrist injury,( now is fully healed) and now I want to play again. I went to a doctor who X-rayed my wrist and knee and those cartilages were almost completely fused. I mean I am still at an age which growing is not a strange thing, I will be doing exercises for increasing my height everyday.. do you think I can still grow some centimetres, any centimetre is good. Thanks
No one can tell you if you will grow taller or not. Generally people are done growing taller by 14-15 years old, especially boys. Chances are you have reached your maximum height. Genetics plays a huge role in the height that you will reach, you can look at the height of your parents and siblings for an example, but everyone is unique. Learn to love your height instead of worrying about growing taller
You're only 16 and achieving a height of 1.70m is considerably acceptable. puberty in most cases stops at 18 but some men stop at 21. So you don't have to worry because eventually you will grow. Exercise will be great help.
Of course, I heard about a guy who was your height, and then when he was 16 or 17, he grew to over 6 feet tall. I'm about your height and 15, but am still expecting a growth spurt in the next year or so.
LOL.... no, exercising or anything else will not have any effect on your height. You can't make yourself grow taller than your genetically programmed to be. Since you're only sixteen there's a possibility that you can still grow some.
Less than 5% of all men are 7 inches or more.
No, it's a good size especially at your age. Slightly above the adult average (and way above if you're a small-penis person who makes up statistics that the adult average is 5.19 inches lmao).
Thats pretty big compared to other 14yo guys, you are lucky you have that... Average penis size are 5-6in.
Normal. Not what you wanna hear... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
that's the internet average
so what if you have.. its the only the same has any other penis

U have to really push yourself to lose weight. LOTS of cardio. If it is your last 5 pounds, if will be exceptionally hard to lose, because your body saves that fat incase you were to starve
that depends on your current weight
as a wise man once said "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem" God doesn't want that for you because he created you for something so much better and he loves you so very much that he died for you. personally i am against homosexuality but i do care for you as any other homosexual. i truly believe that if you trust in Jesus and have faith that he can work through you, anything is possible. there are many cases where homosexuals come to God. What God did for them was marvelous. They ended up reforming their lives and now enjoy and happy life with their wife and kids

When Mommy and Daddy get together to watch a Shrek marathon. It is a grizzling challenge, and they must do so without once going to the toilet, and must never eat food during that time. Afterwards they have to utter the words "Shrek is love, Shrek is life" or they will not have completed the intercourse. Once that is done they have completed it. The deed is done.

Ive ran out of pads and only have tampons so I have to wear one for bed. I hardly bleed at all at night but I still want to wear something incase. I once read somewhere that TSS was only a risk if the tampon was fully expanded. Is this true cause it won't be an issue really then but I don't know enough to go by that. Thanks
4
They say to change them every 6-8 hours. I sleep with a tampon in but I pee about 2-3 times a night so I change it every 4 hours or so. If you can get up half way through the night and change it then I don't think it will be a problem. Just DONT forget you have one in when you wake up. My friend slept with one in and put another one in because she forgot and she had to go to the hospital.
You can leave a tampon in up to 8 hours but leaving them in overnight will do nothing and is completely harmless. Just make sure to change it as soon as you wake up.
You should not really keep a tampon in all night, can you change it halfway through the night?
So I ve been smoking for the past 2 and a half months. I plan on stopping after I smoke my last Cohiba this weekend and maybe only have a cigar maybe once a year or on special occasions. I have smoked maybe 30-50 bowls of pipe tobacco/cigars over this period of time. I am fearful that I could get cancer just be the amount I have smoked thus far. I do have general anxiety disorder, however. So I m not quite sure whether this fear of mine is rational or simply due to my anxiety. Would love some input. Thanks.
If you are not coughing now, you can't tell if what you did will be ignored because you smoked 50 bowls of pipe tobacco or cigars. I think it would help you to go to a doctor and have a check-up anyway. Good luck.
It can, basically cancer happens when the nucleus of a cell gets damaged, everytime you inhale burning-smoke(which is what smoking is) you damage the cells in your mouth/throat/lungs, if that damage is to the wrong part of the cells, you develop cancer. This could actually be a training to handle your Anxiety, quit smoking. The Anxiety-dynamic is about the exact thing you describe here, you take a risk, then worry about that risk you took, so make the choice, you worry about cancer, listen yourself, don't smoke.
You likely won't get cancer, but no amount of cigar/cigarette smoke is ever good for your lungs, so while you probably won't get cancer, your lungs are most likely not going to work as well as they would have, had you never smoked.
I am not an expert but I think it depends if you have the gene that is susceptible to getting a cancer from it. My mother was a chain smoker and died from emphysema complications but she never got cancer. Obviously she never had the gene to trigger it.
If you know something is a poison, does it make sense to think, "Oh, I'll just have a little bit from time to time." Or do you think it's best to avoid it altogether?
quit now because your not gonna do it the first try
Rationalizing a habit you know can kill you????

Breakfast: Oatmeal with a banana + water Lunch: Oatmeal + water Snack: Apple + water Dinner: What I would usely way with a water. I don't have time to eat 4-6 meals and i dont have the money to either, would this help me lose some weight?
Not really. Not enough food. Try again. Avoid all white carbs, and eat Protein, Vegetables, Fruit, Whole Grains, and low fat dairy. What you are eating is too little.
I am a tea lover. I drink green tea, black tea, follower tea, ice tea... This is my first time to drink herbal weight loss tea. The taste is not bad. I drink one cup everyday.

No, just the opposite. It is healthy, natural and an important part of your sexual and body education. We keep it private. That does not mean it is bad or dangerous. It just means it is private and it has nothing to do with anybody else when and how often you do it.
No it's not bad it's natural
No, it's not bad.
its normal, they all do it
I was almost 1 month clean. I was so close. I told my mom once. She just cried and hugged me. Nothing changed except i felt even worse about myself. Don't tell me to see a therapist, i can tell you right now that's not gonna happen. And no, i seriously don't have any other family who i talk to more than once a year. Or any trusted adults. I have no clue why i feel i should tell my mom. She doesn't help it get better. It just makes me look like an attention whore. Sorry, any advice?
Don't tell me to see a therapist, i can tell you right now that's not gonna happen Then it will get worse or you'll find another substitute like whoring around or doing drugs. Cutting is a symptom of other emotional or mental health issue, while it could be as simple as not learning basic coping skills, it can and usually does indicate much deeper seeded issues. Good luck going your own way with this one, it rarely works but there are always a few who pull it off.
Apparently your mom doesn't know what to do, either. She SHOULD be taking you to the doctor. Another case of ignorance being passed down. Go ahead, don't treat it. Don't actually get help for what you claim to want help for. I don't think that you really want help.
telling someone will make you feel that you are not alone and that you're not going through this on your own, so in a way it does actually help. you are not an attention whore or seeker for doing this. you should tell your mother, she seems very caring. i hope the best for you <3
I think there isn't enough things like beans, rice, pastas to fill you up instead of needing 2-3 platefuls If you regularly go to the same shop for your salads speak to them or consult a dietitian that can check if you are missing something in your diet Chetak
It's because you eat 3-4 big plates of salad at once. Nothing to do with cheese
No, it's the bacteria off all the hands that have been in the salad bar before you. How many times have you picked the tongs out of the lettuce? Salad bars are disgusting.
Not such a good idea. a better idea would be to have a reasonable amount of vegetables EVERY day. You can buy prepared salads, prepared dipping veggies, etc. but really how hard is it to make some veggies for dinner every day?
you feel bloated because you ate too much...3-4 big plates of salad is a LOT of food..sure,not much calories but it still takes up space. I highly doubt its anything else but over eating.
It;s better to eat a BALANCED meal, than ALL VEGGIES, twice a week.
It's the vegetables.
Tell a dr. about all this. There are good meds for anxiety.

You need to show your doctor. That's how you start the journey towards getting help. Your doctor will likely refer you to a psychiatrist, who is a doctor that specializes in psychological problems. The psychiatrist will probably, in your case, recommend therapy conducted by a psychologist. Do this and your therapy will likely be covered by most insurance and NHS. You cannot determine how good or bad you are with your current state of mind.
you are young enough to turn your life around.
No, if it did all men would be really screwed up. Since nearly 100% of all guys masturbate A LOT during puberty and throughout their lives. But of course masturbation is a normal act-- just solo sex, same physiological act as sexual intercourse. So no logical reason it would cause any harm.
No. Think about it... Every boy in the world throughout history since the beginning Humanity has masturbated thousands of times before having sex.
Masturbation is learning about sex... healthy-relationship-dating.com/masturb...
I say yes. Many reasons I say yes but I don't have enough space. It will diminish your ability to get a erection as you get older. If young I doubt it would be a problem.
My personal experience says, "no".
No
You can not touch cigarettes and get cancer and smoke ur whole life and get cancer, my nan started at 14 and now is turning 90, my cousin never smoked and died at 34 , so what's to say we will and we won't get cancer , me I really think it has nothin to do with chemicals but more so with how our bodies handle **** in no means am I condoling smoking but I don't think that it makes a big part of cancer but our body will ever have it or won't
Cancer is not one thing. Smoking greatly increases your risk of lung cancer and it is linked to other cancers,but it is not the primary risk driver for most cancers. Nan may smoke a pack a week and never get cancer because the risk comes from heavy, long term use. Someone who smokes 2 packs a day for 10 years is at a higher risk than a 1 pack a day person who smokes for 20 years.
Yes, there is an element of chance. Look on it as a giant lottery with cancer the "prize". Just by being born we get a single ticket. Every time we indulge in risky behaviours we get more tickets. Just by ageing we get more tickets and tickets are constantly drawn.
Your 34 year old cousin didn't die of lung cancer. Your nan is one of the lucky ones. My husband's side of the family is genetically inclined to live to over 100 but there also is a strong line of hereditary macular degeneration. Almost all the men go blind, but not all. It's just luck of the genes.
Nothing's to say we won't get cancer. It's part of life. It's funny you mention chance. That's EXACTLY the meaning of life. Nicotine and smoke INCREASE your chance of getting cancer, they don't guarantee it. It IS how your body handles things, but you don't KNOW how your body is going to handle things You know Nan's, body's capabilities, perhaps, but not your own. So you have to play the odds. One tries to increase their odds of survival, and getting cancer decreases the odds of survival. I don't walk down freeways bc doing so would increase my odds of being hit by a car, and getting hit by a car increases the risk of death.
The cream soda, if it was red, would take at least an hour to get in to your urine stream.If it is blood in your urine, it's likely that you'd be in a lot of pain. I'd wait until the next time and see if it happens again.
No it's not the cream soda. Sounds like you have an infection. You should go for a simple urine test at your doctor's office...it will determine what you have.
Sounds like blood to me!
-That DOESN'T sound Good... You might want to go & See a Medic- if it keeps Happening. :o
When you get close, take your hands off, waiting a couple of seconds then resume.
That has nothing to do with Stamina. More sex perhaps. < M
Masturbate more frequently and take your time, deliberately go slow.
maybe it os alerady too much
go slower
I don't understand this really if everyone were to harm himself whenever something bad happened no on would live on earth
Go straight to your school nurse and tell them. Yourfriend needs immediate help that is a lot more than you can help him with. He will be mad at you, and may even break off the friendship- but the fact is, you would be helping him to tell, because he is in desperate need of medical and psychological help, and that involves the nurse and his doctors. Go NOW.
He requires some divine grace in such critical situations. If you are really interested in his welfare and prosperity, you should pray honestly and sincerely with implicit faith, unshakable belief and unflinching devotion, so that he stops cutting in future.
Tell him that you love him (IF you do.) He chooses the dark path or the not-so-dark path, and you choose whether or not to stay. Any addiction can have relapses. Consider this his. How he handles the next few weeks will show you who he really is.
this is some serious ****, go find anwsers somewhere else I mean yahoo answers really?
Worry. Talk to a doctor. Could be a seizure.
Sounds like a sudden drop in blood pressure. If you're young and it happens again then see your GP. If you're not so young then it might be worth discussing with your GP anyway.
see a doctor
You should go to the doctor
You didn't want to ask; you wanted to brag. Which means it's probably not the size you claim. Do you drive a Dodge pickup truck or are you sensitive about the small size of your hands?
Yes, your penis is bigger than average and a good size.

I agree with some of the other advice here. Very much sounds like a sinus infection.
You may have a sinus infection. I'd recommend going to a different doctor for a second opinion.
sounds like a sinus headache, probably a sinus infection, you need decongestant and possibly antibiotic, BUT the antibiotic does not work on viral infection which a LOT of sinus infections are
I'm sorry the doctor didn't do anything. Can you try another and tell him exactly how you are feeling and exactly what you want?
Take sudafed (pseudphedrine) and ibuprophin.
My 15 year old son was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic recently and has recently been discharged after 9 months in a mental hospital. He thinks he is a reincarnation of Reggie Kray and thinks im trying to poison him with poisoned food. And has been expelled from school for fighting. I dont know how to help him. Any advice greatly be appreciated.
Follow his doctor's orders. Maybe he should be in some type of residential care home. Dr. should have given him meds for schizo..... Look up schizophrenia online to find others dealing with this, and what treatments are available. There are probably support groups also.

Medication? Why is he not on any?
The /80 90 or 60 is stress but the 130 150 and 160 is something to do with blood presure or heart and recently eating a lt of fat and salt wont affect it yet and if it is from cholesterol it would have been from continuous bad diet for several years, doc could give you something for anxiety and check your bp again in a few months and if no change then further investigation, Good Luck
Head pressure sensations are rarely if ever caused by HBP. Most blood pressure problems have NO symptoms Anxiety can cause head pressure though
I have been having a yellowish green discharge and itching or discomfort for about a month... I have been to the clinic several times and I have been prescribed several medications including BV medication and antifungals... Nothing helped... And even then the tests for BV and yeast and STDs have all come back negative what could this be? I have not had sex in 5 months, and no one I have seen has been able to figure it out. I would love to figure it out this is causing me such emotional stress and is really causing me to just break down every other day due tpy anxiety kicking in..
*: ･ﾟ✧ Hi from France ✧ﾟ ･:* (Je suis Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Bruxelles / I'm Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Bruxells) Anxiety may cause the problems you mentioned on here. Anyway the medication should help normally. See a different doctor, for have another opinion. ~~ Have a nice day ~~ Cat.
Okay so I'm always tired no matter what, I sleep my needed hours and everything but when I come home from school I'm so exhausted that I can't even stay awake anymore I just fall asleep wherever. On Friday I came home and knocked out I wanted to wake up but my body didn't allow me to, like my eyes felt so heavy it was only 4 in the afternoon I did not wake up till Saturday late noon and I had forgotten how I even got home the day before. Help?
You're not lacking sleep apparently, though a more regular schedule would be desirable. Are you eating too little or eating the wrong foods? Improve your diet and regularize your eating habits. Other reasons could include anemia, underactive thyroid, chronic fatigue syndrome, sleep apnea, urinary tract infection, food intolerance, diabetes, heart disease, depression, or glandular fever. More likely than not, you don't have an underlying medical condition but should consider regularizing your lifestyle a little more. Focus on getting quality food, quality sleep, and exercise.

hello my friend
The first line of defense against depression and anxiety is B vitamins. Get nutritional yeast powder and/or B-100 pills. Vitamin B2 is a water soluble dye that turns urine bright yellow. So when the color fades, it's time for another pill. Read some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right.
Be always optimistic in your outlook. Be good and do well. Try to earn lot of goodwill from different type of people and invest them. You will soon get back everything in the form of dividends.
Your age is the clue, lots of different hormones rushing round you, just remember,time will cure you. when you feel angry just go into another room, take a deep breath, count to ten.
If you eat extra or drink cola, subtract that amount from the food you eat the next day. That way overall you will still be averaging the same amount per day.

Okay, I woke up and noticed two small red wounds on my neck. I also noticed that I have become extremely pale. Sunlight suddenly began hurting my skin like it was on fire. Im also really, really thirsty and Ive drank almost a gallon of water but nothing quenches my thirst. My teeth grew pointed too... someone help bc i really dont know what to do im scared i wanna go out
seems to me like you had a fun party, mustve blacked out for a day or so, don't worry about those dots on your neck, probably just hickeys, and the paleness is likely from puking a lot, as for the burning from sunlight, it happens when ur hungover, the sunlight is harsh after partying for so long, another part of being hungover is major dehydration, just stay strong bud it wont last forever.
I don't know what your problem is, but i feel you with the paleness. That flash man. Why am i always the whitest person in the picture? It's so annoying!
You're officially a vampire!
It very well could have been real. Children are 'unfiltered' and see everything and don't question it. Adults are filtered and tell themselves such things are impossible, so they don't see them. I'm sure our departed come visit, especially during festive times when family comes together. So nice that you got to see him.
I have heard of stories similar to yours and I believe that it was your uncle who wanted to meet you. You may be interested in this story. An elderly woman who was on her death bed and saw her sister, she hadn't been told that her sister had died recently out of fear that her health was fragile and she couldn't handle it.
I am 14 and 6'2" and my doctor thinks I will be 6'5". My mom is 5'7" and my dad is 5'9". My guess would be around 6'5"-6'8"
Maybe another inch or two. Impossible to say, really.
I think 6'4".
Not much taller. Maybe another inch or two more.
It is not something that can be learned. Very few women can do this. The porn industry has been promoting this as something new, a novelty of sorts. The pornstars simply urinate a little to fool people. There are women that do actually release fluid, but it really doesn't squirt.

I need a stress reliever i can use during class. I dont want to buy anything really, do any of you know any typical item that can be one or maybe some actions. I used to chew gum but i gave up on it. I bounce my leg all the time and tap my pencil/finger on everything which doesn really help. this causes me to have trouble focusing. I will plan out short stories, write poetry, play a new song, play existing songs, ect in my head before i even realize i wasnt paying attention to anything. My mind does what it wants and its getting on my nerves.
The best stress reliever I have found during class is to flick a rubber band on my wrist or doodle on a piece of paper.
Try softly blowing on you thumb, taking deep breaths. Pretty much the stress part of our brains and our breathing part are next to each other, so doing things like this will make some stress pass...
Go online and find websites that teach basic relaxation meditation for free. Practice often. Then, use those techniques when you start to get anxious. Meditation is great! You can do it anywhere but nobody will know you are doing it!

You cannot 'restore' your foreskin, what is gone is gone for good (in both senses of that word). If you have only very recently been circumcised then you must give it plenty of time to fully settle down (at least 8 weeks) before being critical of the result. Stretching the remnant of foreskin rarely works at all and to the extent that it does, the most you can ever hope for is a faux skin that will neither look nor behave like an original foreskin. Don't waste time, effort or money on trying to bring back a foreskin. You are much better off circumcised for health and sexual purposes.
You could speak to your Urologist about a surgical restoration via a skin graft. Or you could attempt mechanical restoration by stretching the remaining foreskin over time. Just do a web search on "foreskin restoration" to find out more info. BTW, neither of these procedures would restore the nerve endings lost from circumcision.
Ignore this troll. He's likely one a persona of Roland or is another crazy kid like Tristan or Shanon. Either that or he's a magical time traveler. He posted a question "I'm getting circumcised TOMORROW" THREE DAYS IN A ROW and said he had it done 10 days ago, yet his question about "finally getting it done" was from over two weeks ago. That's some magical sh't.
There's nothing you can do. Get over it.
I just want to make sure it's not a tumour ok. I'm not saying it definitely is or diagnosing myself; I'm saying I do SEEM to have things in common so of course that's scaring me. And also, I've already said that my mum won't ever believe me on this and take me to the doctor. Over here, I need to actually book an appointment which needs a medicare card and signature. I can't just go by myself ok, please read. If I could frickin get a convenient diagnosis and peace of mind, I would. Peace...
Honestly, this is somewhat typical teenage situation. I'm not discounting that, the brain goes through MASSIVE changes around your age. As I tell people, the teenage years are like the white water rapids in the river of life. The object is to keep your head above water for a few years and not drown, then things with smooth out.
LOL "Teen brain tumors"....don't listen to everything you read on the internet! GO to the DOCTOR...he is your best line of defense. Your ONLY Answer. Let HIM diagnose you. He will send you for all the right tests if he deems it appropriate Don't go diagnosing yourself now. There are MANY Other reasons for weakness.
If it stays for a week, TELL A DOCTOR. if it goes away the next day, shrug it off.
Hi who is your computer? No want win 10 afraid of consequences Make update no come I need lawyer
Wipe it using up and down motions.
Most guys wipe back to front, while girls are taught front to back so they avoid getting poo in their vagina. guys dont' have that issue.
both. its proven to get a better clean that way
The way you have been is probably fine.
from the behind as the hole is there :)
No. And if you've only had your period twice 11 days of fluctuation is not abnormal.
No. Irregular periods are normal, especially to start with.
No. Masterbation does not change the rate at which your uterine lining matures and sheds.
No. There is no connection between the two.
no
I am sure your boyfriend does have an uvula or does he have problems speaking? The uvula is needed for correct pronunciation what is called uvular consonants. It is important that you need to know the words you are typing....I suggest you look up what an uvula actually is. Edit: I call BS.
No you cannot donate it. Ones uvula is needed to keep solids/fluids from entering the nasopharynx when swallowing...similar to the way the epiglottis keeps solids/fluids from entering the lungs when swallowing.
This is not possible.
Sweetie, you are not clever.
Idk if that would work ask the doctor
I'm 15 and a half. I was in my room jacking off to Marilyn Monroe (sorry if that sounds weird), and I forgot to lock the door, and in comes my mom with the vacuum cleaner. She sees me wanking, and takes my phone and computer, and tells me I can't leave my room, because I'm grounded. I don't see what I did wrong. :(
I have an idea. Threaten your Mum and say that if she doesn't un-ground you and give you your devices back, that you will masturbate so much and rape her.
Sorry bruh, you gotta be more discreet. Wait til everyone goes to bed. Also, if she took all your electronics, how did you ask this?
Reported again. You have a fetish for your mum catching you out. Unhealthy.
marilyn is old school she would have approved wan king to the kardashians
no you can't as those come from lifting stuff the wrong way
Sure, if you're doing it wrong.
absolutely, you can. and before it too.
..... lol
In most states, you can buy a gun if you have never been committed to a mental institution. many people suffer from mild to extreme depression, but that does not make a person schizophrenic and out of touch with reality. I know several people who take various medicines for depression, and they own guns.
Yes. The only way any mental illness can stop you from buying a gun is if you have been involuntarily committed to a psych hospital.
If you are OK, your dr. can probably wean you off these drugs. Prozac is an old med; there are better, newer ones now.
I had a bad fear after i slammed into a car going 60 MPH on the freeway. I would try diving on smaller highways and driving for super early or late when they are not many cars around to build confident
Lol, "some people just drive crazy" you mean like those people who are scared to drive on freeways???? cmon op. the cars might not be going too fast, you could be going too slow and thus be causing the problem yourself. You have a gas pedal, you can speed up and merge ahead of them. You have brakes too, you can merge behind them. And since they are probably experienced freeway drivers, they know to make room for you. Just go drive on the freeway for awhile, its easy but it takes getting used to, thats all. Missing exits isnt a big deal, you can always go back.
it takes practice, do some driving during the day on workdays when the roads are less busy than weekends or rush hour, eventually you get mostly used to it
Whenever I come home from school or from staying out I can notice my bedroom has been touched. I notice small things and it really stresses me out. If my mum puts my clothes on my bed or even if she just touches one thing I don't know, I break down and cry. I can't breath and I get really angry and I just really want to hit myself and a lot of the time I do. What is this?? The crying usually happens for 30 minutes and I just can't breath.
IF/When you become a parent, would you check on your children, certainly to make sure all are fine? Especially with all the crimes happening these days? Are you aware that as of a couple of years ago 30% of all the girls and woman in the USA have been Rapped! Plus another 36% were Attempted Raped, but got away? Ask your parents if you can get karate lessons!
It sounds like panic attacks/anxiety. Maybe u should tell ur parents about it or someone you trust. And then go to a doctor! Hope i helped :)
It's stupidity. It's your mothers house, she can clean and tidy your room. If you have a problem with that then you really do have a mental health problem. Tell her not to touch anything so you can sleep in a stinking bed and have no clean clothes to wear.

Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
It sounds like an STD. Most likely herpes which you will have forever if that's what it is. I'm not saying this to scare you, that's just what it sound like it may be. Your best bet is to go get it seen by a doctor. Don't forget to mention that you recently had sex because that is a major factor. If you don't tell them, they'll discover it through testing anyway. And to answer your question, no, it isn't normal to have what you are having after sex. It is abnormal, which sounds like an STD. It is normal if you've had sex with someone with herpes because that typically happens. Good luck. Hope you enjoyed it
Lol I think your a troll but if you aren't then I think you have herpes. Herpes is a common STD that 1/4 sexually active people have. It lasts a lifetime but it may be curable within the next couple of years. Don't have sex with anyone without a condom in the mean time.
I mean I doubt there's any connection. Although sounds a lot like herpagonasyphilaids cx
Lol most likely hormones, if other than its just something normal occurring like any other break out.
Lmao, best yahoo question ever. Yea you scabies or some other STD.

Where did ja do it ,in a pig pen .
It makes me feel like you're a child who has never put his wang in anything besides his own hands.
It makes me feel like your retarted and you don't even have him. He's with people besides you. I feel like he has a woman who isnt ugly like you, but your also gay cuase you have a wang. You very retarded and make LIES to make others Pissed. I feel like he has me and his family and heavan, that your not there. And you never will, Keep living alone

Everybody knows Thai femboys don't really have penises.

No, you didn't. If you want to annoy me, pard, you'll have to do much worse than that.
Wash off the plaster. You'll regret it if you let it dry.

In England, it is known as Prince Charles Syndrome. Fortunately there are very effective homeopathic remedies which will cure it.
Prince Charles does that and has for many years. He is skilled as a gardener. Your friend is not crazy!

No dear. Your child can not magically transfer the blue from the contact lenses into his DNA, lol
No as your genetics is what determines your childrens eye colour and your partners genetics also. Wearing contact lenses what determine your childrens eye colour
Your child will have the same eye color as you or the person whom you have a child with. Eye color is based on genetics, not contacts
No. Eye color is inherited while you acquire contacts. The baby's eyes will not be affected by the contacts because they are not in your gene code.
Yup
No, but if you go and buy a wig of your choice of color to wear, your child will have that color of hair.
Oh yes, it's just like if you lose your foot, your child will also not have a foot.
no because the contacts wont change your genetics. you childs eye color is determined by genetics
Nope; genes and plastic are not related.
Your size is normal for your age. Not too small, not too big, just normal. If you don't ejaculate you can easily say that you're not fertile, but having an ejaculation does not mean by itself that everything is alright. Only a doctor can tell you, or if you have kids that look strongly like you :-)
Normal size And a man is only fertile if he is able to produce sperm. Just because he ejaculate semen doesn't mean that he's fertile. Remember that sperm in semen her to completely different things. Sperm or invisible, you cant see them with the naked eye.
I have a little secret which is that I am a player. I love to satisfy each and every beautiful lady I meet but for that I have to keep my man on its toes. These Prolargentsize pills have enlarged the girth and the size of my penis.
Yes its alright!!!
Yes, definitely. And most likely your pastor will refer you to a doctor or a professional counselor, because depression is often a medical condition. Your pastor would do the same if you talked to him about any other medical condition, like the flu or a broken leg.
What do you mean "is it ok" YEAH YOUR PASTOR WANTS TO HELP go for it dude
often physical. thyroid caused. see an hio method chiropractor.
go see a doctor, counselor, therapist
Yes. It is OK.
yea!
You need to get enrolled in rehab and see a therapist. Go to the gym and get healthcare. Work on your body. Eat healthy. Fill your home with positivity. Throw out EVERYTHING that is dirty or reminds you of your OLD LIFE. Become a different person. It takes will power and dedication. I did this all to over come severe depression and it really helps. You have to go in deep, feet first and just DO IT. If you want a family, you have to work for it, and work on yourself first.
Stop this risky business of going to prostitutes or sleep around, you may be safe now but you may not safe forever, you had your fun with different women and now it’s the time to stop. Have one trusted partner for sex even it may take time to find a one
So, I'm 16 male and I've just been able to pull back my foreskin behind the head. Pulling it didn't hurt but if I touch it, even slightly, it hurts so much. There's also a lot of white flaky stuff that keeps coming back, even when I push through the pain barrier and clean it off. In porn, the head is licked all the time, and the head is clean, so what is different about me?
Porn typically features circumcised men, as circumcised penises are deemed more presentable; just like why you'll rarely to never see a woman in porn with a big bush, or pronounced labia. That white stuff is commonly called 'smegma', and you should clean it where possible. It could just be that your skin is irritated/inflamed, as this is perhaps the first time you've cleaned it. Keep pulling it back and keeping yourself clean over the next few days(careful with harsh soaps), and if the pain persists, go see your doctor. There could be a serious problem with your foreskin, such as it being too small/tight, and it could be strangling your junk.
The fact that they are pornstars. I have done one porn before, nothing is as it seems in the studio. I'm cut but it makes a difference. You feel the sensitivity because that part of your skin is never exposed. It should have been cleaned for your entire life from when you were a baby and every day after that, you should be desensititzed if you've been doing it properly you shouldn't be feeling pain
When you pull back your foreskin for the first time the penis will always be very sensitive but it will eventually go away. I remember mine also being very sensitive but everything is fine now. Uncircumcised penises are just as clean as circumcised, you just have to pull back foreskin when you wash it. Dont listen to idiots here saying that you should be circumcised...
That's so gross. Wash. And the reason you're so dirty is because you're uncircumcised and don't wash properly.
I am so glad I got to try this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product . At first I was not sure if it would work, but actually am surprised that it did! The first day I got the tea, I made myself a cup. it has a very pleasant flavor. No strange after taste or aroma. Just a very nice tasting tea .
Easy? no, it doesn't just go away. You will need to work hard (whether that is diet or exercise [preferably both]) to lose it and weight.
try pure coco butter
I lost $3.00 today.
Of course but fat will become the new thin ie fat people as in ages past will become beautiful because fat will be a sign of wealth
Well, fat people would tend to live longer than skinnier people in times of famine. Mostly because they can use up their fat as energy. Truth be told I feel like if they have their food accessible they would die faster from over eating.
Maybe it will reduce the number of People Haters. Like those who hate obese people.
That all depends on if you are referring to normal "out of breath" or something more acute. Everyone is out of breath for a while after exertion, that is normal. But if it takes you more than a few minutes to breathe normally, you should see a doctor. I am curious however, why this is posted in Religion.
Shortness of breath could also be a symptom of a heart condition. To be totally sure, get checked and have the doctor listen to your heart, if there's a murmur (your heart sounds wishy-washy instead of the usual ka-thump, ka-thump), then you need further testing to check the overall condition of your heart.
sounds like neurogenic diaphragm weakness. in such cases, it tends to be weak unilaterally. other possible diaphragm related symptoms may include one or more of these- side aches, nausea, heartburn, hiccups, sharp postprandial pain briefly at xiphoid. see an hio method chiropractor.
Many possibilities: Asthma, out of shape, or anemia are the most likely.
We all do....but the more you run or exercise the faster you get back to breathing better.
Possibly asthma. Maybe see a doctor and see if you have asthma.
Not enough sex.
Yes, I've known several guys over the years who would be considered "alpha" males-- and they were really cool guys towards me, even though I was nerdy and non-athletic, and they were not jerks like some guys can be.
Of course with 7 billion people in the wold.
Ignore everyone else! Do it carefully, follow the direction you hair grows in with a razor and sensitive shaving foam, I wouldn't do it all at once, shave some of it during once shower and then the rest in your next shower and it will reduce and itchiness or posible razor burn or rash if you do it all at once. Also wear loose soft underwear after shaving as this will also reduce itchiness or rash! I would also use plain unfraganced soap or some femfresh to wash the full area after that just to make sure there is no shaving foam left down there or gets into your vagina! Good Luck!
You CAN'T shave your vagina, correctly or incorrectly. Your vagina is a hairless organ INSIDE your body.
Your vagina is an internal organ. You cannot shave it. It is also hairless, as it is internal.
unless you want the bumps and irritation don't shave it just trim it
Attach wax strips to your clit and yank them off .
best thing to do is watch pron and look up how to do it, the ones who do it best are the porn starts
you don't - guys hate that
It's hard. The food in the cafeterias tends to e high in carbs. Eat as much of your own healthy food as you can. IT costs more, but you don't gain.
Avoid snacking. Three meals per day is all you need.
You can't avoid it
I feel like life isn't real and is nothing but a dream I can't wake up from. Its so maddening now that I sometimes think killing myself would end all these feelings and that I won't feel like this anymore. I suffer from depression, anxiety, panic attacks and now this. Loneliness is consuming me and life doesn't feel livable anymore. I just want it to stop.
sometimes we simply do not understand what is happening in our life and why? things go wrong. Would say suicide isn;t the answer. Bible says we are made fearfully and wonderfully. When we commit to live a life which we do not fancy can be soul wrenching and take a toll on us. All i can say is step out of that bubble and see more of life there is more pain and sorrow in someone else's life than our very own. Counselling could be a good help and you are never alone the same pain and story is living by another person........
I feel exactly the same. Try and narrow down the amount of negative people you have floating around you. I recommend going out more, eating healthier, maybe meeting new people. I know it's easier saying this all than doing it but it's what my councillor always suggests doing. Keep smiling! :)
Is YA the local suicide call center?
If my pap smear results were fine, then wouldn't my doctor tell me over the phone? I'm afraid it may be cancer or I'm infertile. I've only been sexually active for three months with my boyfriend of a little over a year. And I don't have any stds. I do have very heavy periods though. My Pap smear appointment was two weeks ago and she's just now contacting me about them. I'm scared. Should I worry?
It takes time to get results back so the two weeks shouldn't be a concern. Some doctors prefer to do consultations in person versus over the phone. If you are very against meeting in person, request to be told over the phone, however it could be absolutely nothing to a possible issue.
No and they'll probably tell you that everything is fine.
It can be effective. But because Big Pharma only wants people to use drugs that they can make huge profits from, they try to discredit anything else.To lower cholesterol Crestor cost about $120 per month, but you can do it with Red Yeast Rice for about $20 a month. So of course the people from Big Pharma will tell you that Red Yeast Rice is snake oil.
The US government NIH says of chelation therapy "==EDTA chelation therapy supported at NIH study== A NIH study with the acronym TACT is supportive of chelation therapy. Review articles are describing this NIH study. Perhaps a PhD scientist or physician could update the main page. "Chelation reduced adverse cardiovascular events in a post myocardial infarction (MI) population. Patients with diabetes demonstrated even greater benefit, with a number needed to treat of 6.5 patients to prevent a cardiac event over 5 years, with a 41% relative reduction in risk of a cardiac event (p = 0.0002)." a pubmed reference is PMID: 27149141" I just updated the talk area of the wikipedia article on EDTA https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenedi...
hahahahahaha....it originally was AMA approved, but when they found out they could make more profits offering something else, they dropped it.....the rockefellers used to sell kerosene for cancer treatments, but when the more luctrative chemotherapy came along, they dropped the kerosene....for the love of money was at the root of all evil...
The concentrations of rubbing alcohol you get are way too strong to be used as a toner. So if you insist, dilute it down. Or try witch hazel. This is insanely cheap and is the active ingredient in most commercial toners.
id advice you not to you see what alcohol does to you when you drink too much you go DRUNK. but if you apply alcohol to your face god knows what's it going to look like! so don't apply alcohol. id go to my GP and ask for some cream. or you could buy BIO OIL! which is AMAZING!
just wash your face with water even a couple of times a day
You've had it for 6 years and your just NOW asking for help? Smells fishy to me- pun intended!
It is very important that you see your local physician. Especially if this has gone on for 6 years.
Clitorus* I advise you go get that little problem checked out.
Talk to a doctor?
Love it, first time in a long time I've taken supplement that seems to be as accurate as it's description. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is really great as a pre-workout or for a natural energy booster throughout the day. I've only been taking them for a few days but impressed enough to purchase another supply .
Yes. But in one week you won't lose much weight.
Most likely you will lose around 5 pounds....
Include a sensible dinner with that and it's a pretty good plan.
Hmm! Let me think
yeah
I have Type 1 diabetes, and I have been doing my insulin injections for a month now. The grey pen, Lantus, whenever I have to inject myself with that one it feels like its burning my skin, like acid being poured on the skin, I don't know if this is normal for it happen or if I need to go straight to my doctor about it? Any advise? By the way, it also hurts for 2 days afterwards, its like an aching pain where I do the injection.
I think that you should. You might be injecting it directly into your muscles which you shouldn t. Instead look for areas that have fat such as your bottom, your thighs, your arms or your stomach. If you are injecting it into fat it could be a reaction or another thing. I highly recommend that you should go to the doctor.
I would talk to a doctor it could be a reaction to that particular brand or possibly the way you are injecting it shouldn't hurt.

yes, depending how deep the bullet went, and what the bullet is in, like is it in a dead animal or in a person. if the bullet is like 10 cm in, just cut the wound a bit wider and reach right in.
Yes but the pain is blinding.I took one out of my boyfriend's jaw with a penknife and some heroin
Scarlett Johansen did in the movie Lucy. Great movie.
Yes of course in the movies, sci-fi films to be precise lol!!
Only in the movies.
I'm totally freaking out. I left my tampon in for about nine hours today bc I totally forgot about it but I'm not bleeding very much right now (like the tampon barely had any blood). And now I have a headache and I'm nauseous but I can't tell if it's just all in my head??? And I don't have a thermometer so I don't know if I have a fever. What are the chances I have TSS? I'm freaking out but I can't afford to go to the hospital if it's nothing.
It's not TSS. TSS is very rare and is not an automatic punishment for incorrect tampon use. It requires a perfect storm of bad luck to get it.
Wow, you really need to read up on what TSS is and what the symptoms for it are.
All in your head. Relax. Bit like having a cold with no clean handkerchiefs. Uncomfortable, but no the end of the world. Women in general exaggerate the importance of periods.
All in your head. There is a flu going around...it is likely what you have.
Get this instilled in your mind right now. There's no way to make yourself taller. It's genetics. You'll get taller during puberty with a good amount of sleep and a decent diet, but you can't make yourself taller
No. I doubt 2 inches in a month possible. < M
No way to make yourself grow or grow faster.
good luck
Quarantine
it's called quarantine
I'm pretty sure that "Quarantine" is the word you're looking for.
quarantine
quarantine Hospitals do it, too
Your Finger. Oh and good luck, you will need stitches...and it's not fun. They actually stick the needle inside of your cut to stitch you up. Hope you have fun with that experiment.
you would have to cut pretty deep for you to do that and you would bleed to death from loss of blood
chop off your left pinky, halfway through the second metatarsal.
nowhere dont do that, bad, BAAAAAAAD

It will take 5 to 10 minutes to your death then it will no matter you will hang for long. But you will hurt for those who loves you and think about you.
I'm not promoting suicide, because we all know it's not the answer, but if you're worried about how bad it's going to hurt I really don't recommend hanging yourself. It's not quick at all, it's painful, and there are easier less painful things to do.
It will maybe hurt your for a 5 minutes. But remember it will hurt the people that love and care for you for a whole lifetime. Always remember it is good to talk and you are not alone in your thoughts. Peace out x
Odds are, you will not do it properly and your neck will not snap. So, you should count on strangulation as death. It will be gruesome and painful, and about halfway through you will regret what you have done. But it'll be too late- because it's a long process, especially when you're struggling for air.
I watched someone hang himself. Looked like it hurt a lot. He thrashed around a lot, sh*t and p*ssed himself, and died slowly, fighting for air. Probably took 5 minutes to die. Wouldn't wish that death on my worst enemy. (and no, we couldn't reach him where he was. He made sure of it.) Oh, and the other person who witnessed it with me had to be sedated and taken to the hospital.
Obama care allows doctors to euthanize people,so ask a Doctor how to get it done.
It will be the worst 2 mins of your life as you strangle. You will fight to survive and wish there was one chance to live.
If I run across any people who've killed themselves that way I'll be sure to ask about that for you
start with the basics, sleep, nutrition, exercise, and get outside and soak up some sun, do that for like 3 months (like 4x/week) to see if you start feeling better, if you notice even small improvements keep doing it, if you feel worse or don't notice anything go see a therapist....remember life isn't easy, also work on changing how you think, everything is a matter of perspective, look at all things with a glass half full mindset...there's always a positive side of everything if you focus on that you remind yourself it isn't all that bad and could be worse
We have all been there. Try reading the book "The Happiness Track" by Emma Seppala
just go grab a crumpet and spot of tea, lad
you should see a doctor, counselor, therapist.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
if you sleep all the time, you will worsen your depression. you need to get outside in the sun, go for a walk and admire mother nature. beauty is everywhere, because nature is so beautiful. it might sound like a lot of effort, but you just have to. don't you want to get better?? don't you wanna feel better, not feel so depressed all the time? then please try to do things to change! you can do it. i hope you're okay <3 <3
take your dog for a walk get out of the house for 20 minutes It will help you feel a little better if only for 5 minuates
Yes. You lack will. Where there is a will, you can find several ways or solutions.
Yes, go home, lie down on your bed, fall asleep.
No, no reason it would impact size. But at 18 would be done growing anyway.
LOL... no. Why would it? Your penis size has nothing to do with any bone breaks in your body.
No.
You sound jealous and depressed. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
same. I don't really feel jealous though, I just feel like I should have the same level of success as them...especially if we're around the same age. I feel like a failure because I haven't succeeded as much as them... but I always keep in mind that we're all running our own race. Your time will come someday
i feel jealous too, i suppose it would be best not to look at them anymore or pretend they aren't there.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
If the fetus is still inside the woman dies in a few days.
Sepsis
To go to the Doctor... "For God gave us (...) that of power and of love and of soundness of mind" (2 Timothy 1:7. Bible).
Asking in the wrong section, but my guess blood poisoning
Toxaemia at the very least.
No. If you had a 300 calorie snack then took a nap, those calories would get turned into fat. Instead, you burned them off, sort of. The ones from your snack went through your digestive system (they were probably still in your tummy as you worked out) and 300 other calories got burned, for a net gain of 0. If you hadn't worked out, your net gain would have been 300.
Yes
No, because exercise isn't just about weight management. It's about keeping your muscles--including your heart strong. If you don't stay active, things start to go bad on you.

It means her body is getting ready to be fertile but this does not mean your ready for sex. It will take a few months for the body to get all the kinks worked out. Can you get pregnant, most definitely. Sexual intercourse is so much more than a physical interaction. There are feelings involved, not to mention you have to be mature enough to pick a good partner and be able to talk about embarrassing things such as condom use for disease protection and what pleasures you. If not, I say no. Hope this helped. Good luck!
yeah, well the body is ready but is the mind ready? 13 is when folks got married long ago, but the courts can now make criminals out of normal behavior and generate revenue to the state....so they raised the age for a supposed good reason, but the publicis so stupid, they fall for any cockamamie idea that comes along....I would wait until I was legal age to have sex....you really do not want a baby at such a young age....not to mention the legal nightmares you'd go thru.....
No. Having sex with a 12/13 year old is disgusting and illegal. Wait till she's the age of 16 at least
Her body is ready. But, the issue is maturity. Girls that age are usually not even close to being emotionally mature enough for a sexual relationship.
It means that you can get pregnant. And as for sexual intercourse, it depends on whether she wants it or not. It's all preference.
not necessarily. you have sex whenever you feel like you are ready.
I don't know ....
That's Steven Anderson.... Same pastor that thinks if we round up and kill all gays, aids will be eliminated. I'm not sure if he thinks that the aids only comes from gays or that god will reward our mass murder by eliminating a virus... cause he did it when Hitler killed all the jews... God totally got rid of Small pox... it wasn't from immunizations at all.. or if if was then that's only cause god can use tools like scientists decades of research and stuff so it was all god in any case. If you want to believe this guy that's totally your choice... but I think a good dose of skepticism is health when listening to Stevo speaking....
The Bible is a miracle. How 40 authors over 3,000+ years managed to come up with a volume of 66 books with a single theme that survives to this day is truly amazing and shows that only God could have done it.
yes; every word in it is written by God Himself using humans. Science also proves that the bible is true.
Your question makes a absolutely no sense. I don't know what it is you call yourself asking.
YES
Zero. The penis grows much earlier in puberty. Should be an adult now. And huge so hopefully you don't grow any more!
lmao. You're a shrimp. Any man who feels the need to brag about his dick size online (and don't deny that is exactly what you are trying to do), most likely has a tiny dick that they feel insecure about.

A way to eat a large amount and get really lean is if you went high carb low fat vegan. If you have too much of a caloric surplus on a normal diet then you'd get fat. A lot of people would prefer not to do this though, so if not, you'd just have to exercise like crazy then if you eat a relatively clean diet- filled with whole foods and lean meats/proteins.
Opposite you should cut down. Eat lean proteins, veggies, fruits, whole grains, nuts. All in moderation.
Carbs
No. When a person eats a lot, he gets fat.
currently 5'10 16 years old started growing semi late but not too late beginning of 14 years old ( 5'1/5'2 ) sophomore year i was 5'7 beginning of junior year i was 5'9 and a little bit above 5'10 atm, dad is 5'8 and the tallest one in my family currently is 6 foot ( his parents are both under 5'7 ) my second cousin is 5'11 ( again both parents under 5'7) what is the possibility of growing to 6 foot if i do everything accordingly ? Sleep well , drink mill , and exercise daily and more frequently ?
Can only gauge potential to close relatives- 1st cousins, dad, granddad or uncles. But certainly have time to grow if still growing. Guys finish from 15 to 18.
Keep an healthy diet Exercise regularly Genes are also an important part in human growth
it depends upon on genes.you will still grow till 20 years of age.so, don't worry just drink milk daily in the morning and night because it has calcium and calcium is essential for bones and keep on exercising.
you have 3-5 more years of possible growth
I drink a lot of milk, it seems to help.

They will not and they do not have the right too. The idea of a hotline is you feel entirely safe in confining in the individual and at no point will they judge you or get any authorities or family members involved, however they may suggest you talk too them yourself. Also no they do not charge you as they're charity ran usually.
They should be free and confidential. Your first questions should be: "Is this call free? Who, if anyone, can you tell about this call?" Get those two questions out of the way and then talk about why you are calling.
No, and no. http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org 1-800-273-TALK
It is depends. What is soical. It confuses my mind.
Neither. Do you even know what psychosis and bipolar is??? But the sounds of things, you don't even have a mental illness so stop trying to make a problem out of nothing.
Right what exactly are you asking? If u rarely get upset and not annoyed easily then you are definately not at all psychotic or bipolar. U r in fact highly stable which is fantastic. I on the other hadn suffer from these issues. I'm always agitated, annoyed, angry, easily upset, crying for no reason, confused, tense anxious. The meds aim to make me stable like you however they don't work much except reducing the psychosis and delusions.
No it sounds like you're just pretty cool
you mean you are calm even in an argument? i think it just means that you are a calm person and probably more mature than those around you, it's a good thing :)
That is so seriously stupid that you have to be a troll.
To make muscle you need to do some serious weights. Not just lots of reps with a light bar, but a few heavy reps. Then has you approach your goal, slowly change to more of a cardio routine, to keep what you have gained. Also, I will tell you that being a tall, I'm 6'2", makes lifting it harder. Shorter is better...
When I drink Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea #in the morning, it curbs my appetite, reduces my cravings, and gives me more energy! This tea also keeps me going to the bathroom regularly instead of going 3-4 times a week.I lost the pounds and even more (28 pounds total)! I have just ordered the new bottles from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea
You wait for puberty to come in and when you start getting natural bulk and weight, then that's the best time to work out.
Workout with weights or resistance. Eat more.
This sounds similar to what has just happened to me. You're friend obviously doesn't understand what you are going through and doesn't appreciate that you must trust them to tell them. Do you have another friend who you feel would be happy to listen and offer you support? If not, the next step should be a family member or somebody such as a councillor. I know it's hard, don't give up because there's somebody out there who will offer you the support you need.
In all honesty I've thought about killing myself too. Many times at that. But first off don't things get better. Second off that only applies if you let it get better. I agree with some of these people. Hearing you talk about your depression probably wants to make her kill herself. It's good to talk about it but don't be grudge to be around. When I feel this way I light a cigarillo sit down and talk to God. Just sit chill relax and know that maybe the past sucked and the future might too. But right at this present moment you are talking to God and chilling and no one can take that from you.
That's a horrible thing to say to anyone, let alone your friend! That girl is not your friend. If she's tired of hearing you talk about your anxiety, rather than ask "Why don't you kill yourself?" she could say "Maybe you need to speak with a therapist." This is so sad! I'm really sorry you are going through this. Anxiety is bad enough, you definitely don't need people making you feel worse.
That's a contradiction. If they told you to kill yourself, their no kind of friend. Especially if it's her response to you confiding in her about something quite personal. Better question, why don't you get away from people like this? You don't need these sorts around you.
It's great that you are reaching out for help! We are so sorry to hear that you have been struggling with anxiety and depression. What your friend said to you about killing yourself must have really hurt. It really does sound like you have been going through a lot. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent, aunt, uncle, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. Please consider getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
Being the horrible person I am, I would tell you to kill yourself . But I guess I don't really count because I have depression and anxiety too so I would think of suicide as the outcome as I have tried many a time before. Still, your friend don't sound too nice
Sorry, but she's probably tired of hearing you whine around all the time. I had a very dear friend who literally wore me down to a nub. She complained for hours every time I saw her. She didn't want help, she just wanted to complain. I had to stop seeing her. You have to get yourself more cheerful. Get some exercise, some new interests. Take pride in your appearance and get outdoors every day. See a doctor and get some help with your issues. When you're a more cheerful person, your relationship with others will improve.
Ugh, rude! Don't let anyone bring you down sweetie. You're better than a person like your "friend". And as a future reference in case it ever comes to your mind, don't kill yourself. You are loved, and even if things are horrible then, you will find your meaning in life. I had the same feelings, and I still get the anxiety depressed state of mind, but seeing my daughter smiling at me is what gets me through everything and gives me that extra purpose in life. Just hang in there. :)
98 lb to 132 lb is her healthy weight range according to http://www.calorieking.com/interactive-tools/how-many-calories-should-you-eat? To lose weight, she should eat 1200-1400 calories per day. To maintain her weight she should eat 1700-1900 calories per day. To gain weight, she should eat 2200-2400 calories per day. Her BMI is 32.9 according to https://nccd.cdc.gov/dnpabmi making her overweight/obese. I suggest you talk to her doctor before putting her on any kind of diet though. Hope I helped :)
Probably about 1200 would work, less for weight loss.
a lot less than you are currently eating - cut down to 1000-1200
I have depression with psychotic symptoms because of the unbearable physical, emotional and sexual torture I endured in school. It started when I was in the nursery and ended when I left the sixth form. I did everything possible to stop it, but all efforts came to nothing. I self-harm regularly and have attempted suicide in the past. How do I recover from what they've done to me. It's all I can every think about.
Find them and assault them very badly.abuse them as much as you can.beat them up until you feel satisfied.let them feel that feelings which you had experienced.I swear you will feel great.do not let them go at any cost.why are you punishing yourself for those b@stard's deeds.teach them a big lesson.
Everyone talks about how every sexuality should be accepted, every gender, boys should be allowed to be feminin, girls masculin. But why arent men allowed to be men anymore? Why dont men want to be men anymore? Real men that build houses and cars, men who workout to be animals not look sexy, men who go out with friends or to get some ***, men who can fight and play some ******* rugby, men who eat some ******* meat, who arent dominated by their ******* gf, who actually pay for their girl and are respected by them. Wtf happend
They can be. In fact, they are expected to be. There are just these b itches called feminists that will demand equality. But Honestly most women like it when you are a gentleman. Cowards are still mocked and ridiculed and MEN are still praised. This is in our evolutionary instincts and will never change, especially since evolution has stopped
You can't expect things to go unchanged. If you want to know why just look at all these subliminal messages in kids shows and shows nowadays. Some people call them the "illuminati"
nothing is preventing men from being men - where do you get that from?
thst your personal perception
Also known as Rest Cramps. Especially in older adults, cramps at rest (often during the night) are very common. Rest cramps may be experienced at any age, however, including during childhood. While not life-threatening, night cramps can be very disruptive of sleep and otherwise quite disturbing. They sometimes recur frequently (that is, many times a night, and/or many nights each week) and are very painful. The actual cause of night cramps is unknown. Sometimes, such cramps seem to be initiated by making a movement that shortens the muscle, which then cramps. An example is pointing the toe down while lying in bed, which shortens the calf muscle, a common site of cramps.
We just called them growing pains as a kid.
Magnesium deficiency (which is common) can cause that.
You weigh a little more than you should, but officially you are not overweight. Your weight should be closer to 54 kg, but if you are healthy, don't worry about it.
You are in the normal weight range, I pound or so more will put you in the overweight range.
No way

At top of adult size flaccid, no reason to be embarrassed at the urinals. Not that guys can generally see your penis much when peeing. Erect size is about an inch above adult average. Well hung, dude, be proud.
Yes, your penis size is very good. You have no reason to be embarrassed peeing at urinals.
Troll. No guy ever says he's embarrassed by having a large penis. And on top of all that... Unless you were to show your penis off on purpose, no one's going to see you urinating.
No, you are perfect size.
Whoever told you that is not at all concerned about you and your health and well being. No reputable trainer or coach would tell you that. It is terrible advice. Since you are an athlete, or at least working out, you need a minimum of 1500 to 1800 calories a day.
You can do this for a short period. It isn't healthy and I strongly suggest going to 1400 calories the next day and rotate low calorie days with high calorie if you will be doing this for more than 3 days. It will still give you a deficite, but it isn't as unhealthy as a long period of 600 calorie .
Incorrect. That is less than half the calories you should eat, and you may very well die of malnutrition.
If it's ibuprofen, you're already fúcked. They can cause severe bleeding ulcers. I'd drink water with some salt dissolved. And have a snack like the other guy said.
Just eat some food and you will be fine! :) Your stomach won't be screwed because it is just two pill . :) Talking from experience.
taking pills in empty stomach is not good.you should not take it without food.eat some snacks and seek medical advice from the doctor for your stomach pain.
Just grab a snack.
try 7upor gingerale....or pepto bismol now....use saltines too
ull be fine
Just solo sex, no such side effects as you describe- otherwise all men and teens would be lethargic and weak and unmotivated. See a doctor if you are feeling bad. Certainly not related to simple masturbation, that is a normal bodily function and sounds like you have a low sex drive if you did not start until 19. Might need to get your testosterone levels checked, low T can cause you to feel weak. Certainly masturbation does not lower your body's ability to use testosterone- makes no logical sense. You ejaculate because your T levels are decent.
what's the point of M'btg if you aren't going to ejac? that's ridiculous
If you invent a beat-off machine and turn it on high you can churn you balls to cream....
The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches with a girth of 4 inches. So your penis is bigger than average. Just take things easy.
Incredible. Gained 1,5 inches so far. Prolargentsize capsule is a miracle. It made my life. I enjoy my sex life. I will be a repeat costumer of Prolargentsize
No, in top 10 percent in terms of size.
Either you have big and long penis or she has small vagina... But your penis is quite good and its normal.
so what you gonna do about it if you are told that its abnormal ?
small if you are afro american
It must be such a strong hate you feel to want someone dead really bad, no of course it is not normal. Try keep your mind off that person and avoid any contact with them.
Depends on who those people are, why you want them to be dead, what they did to make you feel that way ..
its normal if they gave you a good reason to feel that way, ive felt that way about some people myself but i would never tell them or act on it
why would you want anyone dead? that is psychotic thinking
if they are sexual criminals i feel liek that too. but god cares about them so its a balance of i need to care but i cant let them keep doing that either.
should you be expressing this online? no, think about it.
I lost 5 pounds on my first weight loss gren store tea bottle. Definitely reordering since I have about 20 more pounds to go
The same way you'd do it anywhere else. Consume fewer calories than your body uses. Eat right. Eating is 80% of your fat loss program. Exercise. There are tons of free workout videos online or you can walk, run, bike, or swim from home or your local area. No gym required. ☺
thanks Christine, i will try what you said, thanks again :)
try sucking on it
pull it out DOOFUS
ER .
Mostly, I drink water due to eating high fiber. In that case, it's necessary. I don't lose weight from that. I cook my own meals which are so appetizing, instead of losing I've gained ten lbs. But you might have better luck if water substitutes for sweetened beverages. Also, find out about your calcium requirement and if supplements work. You might need 1500 mg daily. I used to get it from milk. As a result, I've strong bones.
I've been drinking water for over 40 years. I'm not seeing a significant weight loss.
it doesn't have any calories or other things you find in soda, beer, or other drinks. it doesn't hurt you. if you're that concerned about your weight, go see your doctor. they can run a physical, see if you have any issues preventing weight loss, and help come up with a realistic diet plan and exercise goals to focus on. it's always good to get a physical once a year anyway to make sure everything is OK.
Water is fine but not to be the only thing you drink as you won't get enough sugar intake ect. Water is healthy just be careful
You'll die of starvation only drinking water. DUH. The human body requires 8-10 glasses of water a day. You should have been drinking water your whole freaking life already.
There are too many variables to even list that may affect your body weight, & water is just one of them ....
A couple of days ago I saw a question about someone who wanted to know why a man shouldn't stop masturbating. A user said something very interesting. I want to know if you completely agree with this user, thanks in advance! Plain and simple: don't try to stop, instead try to figure out why you have negative feelings about it, which is the real issue. Masturbation serves a vital role; it's not just for pleasuring yourself, nor a "substitute for the real thing" (that's complete bollocks, by the way), but an essential part of being male. Let's leave psychology for now, and focus on biology.
Furthermore, if you don't masturbate your body will need to get rid of the excess sperm. Now if you are extremely lucky, you'll experience frequent wet dreams, but more likely, your body will have to resorb the sperm you've produced. This resorption process also triggers your immune system, which leads to antibodies being produced against your own sperm.
Not a good thing if you want to become a daddy later in life. In many cases, there is a correlation between poor fertility, and low masturbation frequency Then there's prostate cancer - the most common cancer in men over 40. It has been shown, without a shadow of a doubt, that men who masturbate daily throughout their lives, have a much, much smaller chance of getting prostate cancer later in life.
Having said that (and this is just the tip of the iceberg), my answer is, once again: don't stop. Masturbation is fun, it's healthy for you, it's relaxing, and there really is no logical argument why you shouldn't. And no, religion doesn't count either. Neither the bible, nor the quran, nor the torah says that you shouldn't masturbate.
it depends. some people find it very painful other people find it mildly painful and some people feel no pain at all. My teeth are sensitive in the front so that is the only place it ever hurts me. as soon as you touch my teeth with metal in the front it hurts without even having to dig or scrape at them. I did not like the ultrasonic thing. it was like water torture to me and I refused to ever have it again.
Just as for a pain pill scrip.
no it won't hurt
what's wrong with me? I just don't feel happy anymore. I've felt this way for 8 months and I feel like a failure and I mess up doing every little thing. No teachers trust me and that really effects how I see myself. I self harm and although people say it's for attention to me it's really not. All of my friends are really exited for summer and I'm just not, this sounds crazy but school might be the only thing keeping me here. At school I have the teachers I trust, my school counselor, and my friends. Anyways that probably didn't make any since but I'm just not sure if I'm really depressed or if I'm just sad
It's depression. Go find professional help. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you let depression take control over your life, It's over.
Either way, you should now compulsorily take some drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail and consult a psychiatrist forthwith.
I wanna cuddle with a fat women that feels like a pillow
Yes
No but cuddle someone you love and I'll be happy.
With an attractive woman, yes
Sometimes.
Only with the right woman.
Sure.
No
no
Not at the minute thanks ....
Prolargentsize is a fantastic product. It gives you that additional increase in the bedroom. I'll recommend it to my buddies and it functions very well. I've only taken it for 3 weeks, and it's already show results. Next time I certainly buy 2 bottles, at least!
The Average vagina is 6inches in depth which closes matches the average size of a male penis. Vaginas do vary in tightness, sometime due to hormonal issues and other times due to physical conditions.
Mine is only 4 inches and women can obviously tell I have a small one. So if yours is as small as mine, yes they can tell.
If she's seen a lot of other penises before she'll be able to tell the difference, if she hasn't then she really wouldn't know.
If she starts laughing hysterically at your d*ck then you'll know she can tell.
Yes they can all tell the difference. It feels completely different.
Yes, unless it's the only one she's ever seen.
Yeah, the small ones don't hurt. < M
If she starts laughing
LOL. Can you tell the difference between large and small pu*ssy? Use your brain, please... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Frankly, it's all up to you. Some people will say yes and be horrified you wanted to do such a thing, while sickos will say end it. I know where your coming from, I feel the exact same way. I was close, but the only thing that kept me from it was my fear of what's after death. Now, I'm kinda just living to see what happens next. It's your choice. If you want to, go ahead. If not, stop. Just make sure you don't regret your choice.
Wishing and whining cannot fix anything. It is my job to upend the small corners of corruption that come my way and to make the lives of those around me better. Anything more is just egotism and ranting to feel important in my misery.
Coward. You could help fight these injustices, not ignore them. You might not be able to help everyone, but you can help people one at a time. Even small things mean more to someone in need then you seem to realize.
No. You can't help anyone if you are dead. God has a purpose for your life. I suggest reading the New Testament. I found answers there.
where do you live that you see this?
Philosophically speaking, it depends. You should take your horoscope to a famous astrologer and ask for an auspicious time to start living. Till then please wait. Have patience.
What you DO with your life is up to you.
Never, ever listen to a BMI calculator. BMI calculators don't take muscle, breast size or any number of things into the equation. A guy I went to high school with was considered obese by the BMI charts, but he was actually very lean, he was just pure muscle. My BMI chart classifies me as overweight, but my body fat percentage is low. I'm also just very muscular. If you want to know if you are obese or overweight, please go see your doctor and let him/her tell you.
Apparently one simply can't precisely say anything about your figure with that picture. Surely there are sites where you can calculate your BMI and telling you exactly in what condition are you in. You can check them out. But safely to say. You are indeed fat.
There's no way for us to know, because that isn't actually a pic of you, you're a troll.
Oh, there is no way this could possibly be a troll. I'm an idiot, you have totally fooled me!
Check your BMI and forget pictures
You seem to at least have high body fat.
No, you're just overweight.
overweight
You need sugar in your diet, just not processed sugar. Replace things like candy with natural sweets. Dark chocolates, fruits, etc.
it'll take a few weeks, maybe even more, and you'll get cravings badly the first week but it's very possible that you can stop eating sugar if you really wanted to
probably
Small variations can happen , sometimes for the better. There is no need to act so smug . Provide some facts to back up what you say. You could also have had pseudo myopia which is often temporary and goes away. A - 0.25 or even - 0.50 can reverse , but it's very rare. It is more often just a different opinion by the examiner as to whether it should be prescribed or not. You don't give us any proof or even any idea of what prescription changes you are talking about so what you are saying could be just a false story too. Myopia of over - 1.00 does not go away.
My eyes did this too. They went from -5.50 to -5.25, and the other from -5.25 to -5.00. You know, they got a tiny bit better. I would hardly say that my myopia has been reversed.
Great ! What are your before and after prescriptions ?
You can't know for sure. He needs to be seen by a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. A lot of people don't understand the symptoms of schizophrenia. The think what they see on TV (split personalities, etc.) is the truth. There are a number of other things that have similar symptoms, including medical conditions, drug use, and other mental conditions.
After he has seen a psychiatrist and been properly diagnosed...... Edit - You can't. Unless and until he sees that treatment would improve his life there is nothing you can do. IF he is violent you can call the police and they can take him to a hospital (which is how most schizophrenics get diagnosed) but they might just shoot him instead (yes, this really happens frequently). If he refuses treatment and he is having a negative impact on your life then you need to do what you can to protect yourself from him and leave him to his own devices....
I'm sure tests are available online, one being Embarrassing Bodies, that should be reliable. Although I would want to get a professional opinion. Try booking in with a GP, your doctor should run a few basic tests and decide if he needs refering to a specialist to undergo further tests.
On all such genuine doubts pertaining to mental health in general, you should first take help from your beloved parents. They will let you know.
Only a dr. can test, diagnose and treat him.
WebMD is able to answer all your questions.

Go to counselling
1.) Check their pulse, (should be 💯🔟-60 beats / minute) 2.) Check the breathing (should be 1.5H breaths / minute) 3.) If both seem fine, leave large 40oz bottle of water by their side, for when they wake up.) 4.) Place a pillow underneath them to cushion their head 5.) Wait patiently by their side, checking their pulse + breathing every 30-45 minutes. 😂
Make sure they are on their side and leave a bucket and a bottle of water in reach. Maybe a blanket but to the hips only
Call 911.

Usually mood swings and occasionally sporadic behavior are signs of depression; however, if you are a generally happy person you could just be stuck in a rut! The same thing has happened to me. For me I think that there were some other issues in my life going on that I couldn't really talk about so I took my anger out on my best friend (that sounds bad, I didn't punch her or anything I was just considerably snappy and rude). I hope it gets better! :)
You could just be having a few bad days
How old are you? Could this be a case of normal adolescent mood swings?
Thats completely normal for us teens to get random erections, that is how our body works. Some does have an erection fewer than others, some erection are caused by different stimulation like others find touching their neck makes them erect. You shouldnt worry about it since your 15 and still in puberty, your body is still changing and your brain is constantly rewiring itself on how to react to something...
What does exercising have to do with getting erections? Males from Early Childhood through old age get several random, spontaneous erections per day. Average is around 10 to 12.
Maybe getting mature, where random erections are less common unlike when 12-14 and they pop up all the time.
Yes. But depending on where you hit you will also cause damage to your hand/wrist. Hit someone square on the forehead with your fist and you will probably sustain more damage to yourself. Newton's third law applies in all cases like this.
You could seriously hurt someone. You could go to prison for assault or maybe for actually causing death. People die from one punch.
Lost foam cast some brass knuckles and the answer is yes.
yes, people die every year from a single punch
Why are you so intent on harming others? You need to get some mental help, and I mean ASAP!
no - your hand would break into 50 pieces because you're too weak from playing games
that depends.
Type in the word vagina in your search engine and get a detailed picture of what your vagina looks like.
if you get a period then yes you have a vagina. that would be where the blood is coming from once a month.
It's not a gaping hole, it's not something you can see. It expands when you put something into it.
this question has to be a joke, right? it's next to your *******
should be in front where both legs meet, tell a guy to fu ck you and im sure he will find it for you
What a cûnt
Check with your doc. Where do you pee from?
only kniw you
there are no words
Where do you put your tampon?
try slowing down when you speak and really think about the words that you are trying to say.
Go to a speech therapist. They show you how to stop. Plenty of famous people were once stutterers.

NO. Weed is illegal for a reason; IT DAMAGES YOUR BRAIN!
Yep, sure can.
Yes, it is normal to masturbate 4 times a day. It may be slightly excessive, but a lot of guys masturbate frequently like this.
i always masturbate 2-4 times a day is it normal
Perfectly normal
Sure. If you're about 12 years old.
Above the average rate of at least once daily so not "normal".

Don't try and gain weight through fat. Get muscle mass. This will be more work, but if you have a thinner stature like me (5'9" 117 lbs) the only way you'll keep this is through making it muscle and toning up. Also eat healthier foods. I mean foods closer to nature like vegetables and fruit. Not fast food fruit either. Buy it yourself and make home dinners with the ingredients. Preferably find a farmers market nearby and shop there.
join gym to gain muscles and eat some sweeter things and that type of food which have high calories
Don't exersize and eat sweeter things. Not fast food, but little candies or treats.
Don't. There is nothing wrong with having a BMI of 18.0
Bananas and milkshakes.
work out and build muscle
You can talk to a psychiatrist or a priest/pastor. For now, I suggest avoiding playing those kind of games. God can help you with your anger if you let Him.
Stop playing those video games.
Try an exorcist
Where is the time for all these things? When there are so many astonishing wonders happening in and around the world, who will bother about the idiot sitting idle in the sofa, doing nothing productive.
yeah I hate it when I'm giving my husband oral and his penis rips off because he's sitting up. It's so embarrassing when that happens. It's a good thing you have those super Santa Claus powers to travel the whole world in a single night and peep into everyone's windows making sure that they never have or never will reach orgasm while sitting up.
First of all it doesnt sound comfortable, theres a lot of more comfortable position that we will enjoy with. Just lie down or stand up, very basic yet very comfortable and not annoying.
well i do it all of the time and i have suffered no ill effects from it
Although we are all supposed to be adults, sometimes even grown ups pick on people they have a romantic attraction toward. So, if it is a guy that is bullying you say, "I know you are picking on me because of frustration from your gender confusion and all, but I don't swing that way, dude!" You will shut him down faster than a fist to the adam's apple! The same thing works if it is a girl: "I'm really flattered by your juvenile pick-on-your-crush tactic, but this is embarassing because I'm SO not into you!" They'll NEVER pick on you again!
The more you SHOW them you are upset, the more it rewards them .. and the more they WILL bully you. The best way to handle it is for you to work with YOUR emotions inwardly. And outwardly show no response. Get some therapy for tips on how to do that. But do expect that for the first 2-3 weeks, once you STOP rewarding them by getting upset .. for the first 2-3 weeks, they will try harder. Eventually, they will give up. Solutions never come quickly. And our happiness is 100% dependent on what WE tell ourselves, on how WE handle our emotions.
If you want to be remembered that people shouldn't mess with you, respect you more, stick up for yourself. If that doesn't help, you can try to report it to the school administrator. But sometimes it doesn't solve the problem, so i would try to stick up for yourself.
Just look at him like this 0.O???? so what dude..... Does it look like i give a sht?? then walk away. If u pay him any attention then u just gave him what he wants.. you might as well suck em off.
get in their face and give it back to them - some bullies are just cowards
Not at all depending on the reason, I'm fifteen and I started birth control when I was still 13 I had a weird period cycle and i had a lot of mood swings due to that,and that's why I went on it. My mom was the one who brought it up as a solution. I'm glad I'm on it. It hasn't affected my health negatively
All prescription drugs have side effects To start with, they all reduce your levels of Co Enzyme Q10 which is beneficial to your heart.
yes
depends on your reason. if your reason is to have a lighter and more regular period, that's fine. if your reason is so that you can have sex, no.
nope. that mean oyu can have alot of sex too. go get it
YES! by stopping smoking, your chances of many diseases will decrease. In 20 minutes, your blood pressure will go back to normal. In 12 hours, your body will be free of carbon monoxide. In 2 weeks circulation and lung function will improve. In 1 year, your risk (compared to smokers) of getting heart disease is halved. In 5 Years your stroke risk is reduced to that of a nonsmoker’s In 10 Years your lung cancer death rate is about half that of a smoker’s. Your risk of cancers of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, kidney, and pancreas decreases.
Yes
Zero from cigarettes
You have zero risk
of course.
That's great. The girth is more important to girls and you've got it. A lot of it.
It would be better if it were 6.485 inches long and 5.113 girth.

It depends on how much and how frequently you eat pineapple. But on average it takes approximately a week. Your semen will not taste exactly like pineapple, but it will make it nice and sweet.
Your semen wont taste like pineapple. It may acquire a sweeter taste to it, but it wont taste specifically like pineapples. It usually takes about 2 weeks for it to work, with varying results. BTW, most all fruit will have this effect, it's just that pineapple seems to work the best.
Semen, not sperm. Semen is what you see and smell, and taste apparently. Sperm is only a tiny ingredient in semen. As to time, would take several days to impact the flavor.
i just add pineapple juice to my cu mm to flavor it

Yes. There are two best solutions for this problem. 1) Know for certain stopping is a subsequent action. If you don't take any preliminary steps (to self-harm), the question of stopping will not arise. 2) In our society, there are some unscrupulous elements and mischief mongers. If you want to be safe, you should never listen to their bad words of advice. They simply misguide you or mislead you and enjoy the fun.
Its a symptom of depression. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It's an excellent antidepressant that works wonders.---- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole, new, healthy, confident, happy person.
Professional amd nutritional help. This problem is largely in America, we're obviously doing something wrong.
I would very much doubt at 15y/o you would get a b0ner in the showers or while changing at the YMCA. A 13y/o might get one but by 15y/o guys don't get b0ners from getting naked with others. Don't shower in your underwear as it makes you look weak and stupid. Shy embarrassed guys wear underwear in the showers and at 15y/o you are turning into a young man and confident young men are comfortable showering and being naked in front of other guys in the locker room. Time to let the confident young man as I mam sure you are past the easy b0ner stage of life.
You must shower naked since if you are wearing underwear you cannot wash your genitals, which get very sweaty in the gym. It is rare to get an erection in the shower, but if you do then just ignore it and carry on. Nobody else will care should you happen to get an erection - we are all men together in the locker room and showers.
You better take shower in nude. If you get Bonner do not worry as others are also males and they too have cocks they may also get bonners. quiitely enjoy every thing . After showers come out as if nothing happened Regards.
The others don't shower you think? Grow up, take your cloth off and shower!
Shower naked and don't be embarrassed if you get an erection.
Shower naked.
You asked this exact question 3 1/2 months ago. You also asked a similar question a few weeks ago. You have your answers by now. If this is a "fetish thing" there are other places you can post.

Naked of course. Why would you get a *****??????

No such thing as a detox bath. The detox business is a lie to fool the gullible and take their money.
Lol. You can't "detox" in a bath. Toxin removal is a function of your liver and kidneys - not your skin. Be wary of nonsense you read on the internets.
You can do this wasteful ritual as many times as you wish. Detox is a scam word often used in the alternative medicine industry (quackery). What are the names of the toxins that you are hoping to remove?
Epson salt is beneficial as a source of magnesium, but doesn't detoxify you. Lavender smells nice. It sounds good and harmless and as long as you don't drink the water. Your liver and kidneys have evolved over the ages to detoxify your body. They are doing a good job. Just drink sufficient but not excessive water and keep away from alcohol.
Once per day is fine, Your body will only give up so much waste per day. It's not like turning on a faucet.
If I tell my doctor I'm going to commit suicide etc what will he do? I'm at a cross road where the emotional pain I'm in at the moment seems like it will never go. And on the other hand I don't want to put my family through the pain of my suicide. I've tried giving recovery a go and nothing is working everyday that goes by I'm more certain that this is something I want to do. Deep down I don't want to die but I literally feel like I have no choice
If you have the motive and the means, you could get put into a mental facility, which might honestly be the best thing for you right now. Emotional pain can tend to feel like it will last forever and it's common to feel hopeless. Remember that what you're feeling right now is not guaranteed to last forever. I would definitely seek out help in some way.
It depends on your age but if you're a minor he is obligated to tell your legal guardian and they will most likely send you to a hospital to get the help you need. If you're over 18 then I believe all he can do is recommend you go to a hospital and give you options for help
If you're female, you've already stopped growing. If you're male, you're about to stop growing. Either way, pushups won't make a lick of difference.
Yes.
No
why would it affect your height?
No not unless you have some major health problem. It's just like having a pop or some coffee.
Very bad and at your age don't damage your health and side effects. Not worth it. Eat a piece of cheese.
It's just caffeine. If you have heart issues I guess it could cause problems but it's really not that bad for you.
it taste like metal and yeah it will probably kill you.
1 sure you will be ok...
That's a hemorrhoid - they come from our horrible diet with no fiber in it. Pretty common - when it hurts enough think about changing your diet.
Your wife saw it while she was sodomizing you with a massive strap-on dildo. But no worries because it is not an actual pimple. It is just a friction mark. Next time, use more anal lube.
some time you have to much acid inside in you stomach and affecting you system keep you *** clean at all times. wiping you but is no enough, clean it with sop and water each time you s**
I took this to incorporate to my workout supplements and Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked really great. It gave me more than enough energy especially for lifting weights and I can see faster results in my shaping up. It also kind of jolted me up in the bedroom for some reason and my girlfriend was appreciative of that...I guess that's what the sexy lady on the bottle cover is for.
I assure you, this is it. It works just as well if not better. Also, I had no side effects as I did with the products that didn't even work very well. You can buy this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme with confidence.
No... I think you're confused.
Try it and see.
Im 19 years old, male, about to be in college. I want to become responsible for my own health and care but my parents aren't letting me. My mom still schedules my doctor's appointments and dental appointments and she won't let me go to them by myself, she always has to come. I DO NOT WANT or NEED my mother to come with my to any of my appointments unless I ask her to. My dad pays for my insurance and he lives in another state. How do I take control of my own medical and health care?
You man up and tell your mother to stay in the waiting room or stay home, which would be even better. Until you stand up to her and get her to admit you are a grown man, you won't be able to take control. She actually should not be able to go back with you- that is a violation of your HIPPA privacy rights since you are no longer a minor.
I assume you're still living at home. Is your mom making your living there conditional upon your letting her make your health appointments and go to them with you? If not, tell her that you appreciate her past help, and that you're now old enough to take care of your appointments yourself. And that from now on you'll be scheduling your own appointments and going to them by yourself. If she does not agree, tell your doctor's and dentist's offices that you will be scheduling your own appointments and that they should not allow your mom to schedule any. And go to your appointments by yourself.
Be grateful someone else is paying for your appointments... and use this help for as long as you can. Really.... dental and medical is very expensive (especially dental because the insurance doesn't pay a lot for dental most of the time and you end up going broke paying your portion of the appointment. So if your mother is paying, by all means accept her help. Hell i wish someone were paying MY medical bills.
Have you talked to your Mom about this? Another option might be to discuss this with your Dad and see if he can talk to your Mom about giving you some privacy. Slightly underhanded would be to call and reschedule your appointments and not tell your Mom. Then you can go yourself.
Hello so I'm a 18 yr old female,and a senior in high school I'm really short and I hate it I'm 4" 7 and weight around 108 lbs.I'm not even 5 foot I look at sophomor e girls and they are towering giant. they look like 20 year olds. I look like a 12 year old compared to them. It just makes me feel insecure. I hate being a dwarf what can I do about it ?? And yes i do eat healthy and everything. Out of all my siblings I'm the shortest I just don't understand. Thanks in advanced
If your doctor says you have reached your limit of growth, then you can't really do anything about it. Plus don't worry. Some guys so love short girls.. lol. But really dont make it a problem until it become a problem. Your height is something that can not really change unless your growing. At your age your still growing. I think you have a few years left until you completely stop.
Your height is beautiful! I would kill to have your height! :-) I'm a 15 year old female, and 5'5. I feel as if I'm too tall and that guys don't like tall girls. SO many guys love short girls, and even so, being short is awesome! As someone who has been 5'0 since age 11 and wanted everything to grow, I now change my mind. It really isn't as glamorous as you think it is. Embrace your height girl, tall or short you're beautiful the way you are!
Embrase ur height and use it for the cuteness it is. As a 5 10 woman i cant wear heels and feel like a beast against small woman. As you get older you will really see the benefits in lots of ways. Plus you prob have smaller feet so cheaper shoes and thats always a bonus 😊 Pls dnt threat to much on it because its really something that wnt stop u getting anything or going anywhere in life
Well if your a girl you should ask your mum if she grew after her 18s and if so that means you'll genetically grow after your 18s also try swimming 3 times a week👌 goodluck💕💕
You have probably finished major growth, but growth in height continues to be possible until approximately 19--there's no definite cut-off. However, by age 26, all bones in your body should finish growing and knitting together. Not all individuals grow to be as tall or as short because of genetics. So, don't worry; it's normal. And you're not the only one, I assure you. (;^ω^)
Pretty sure you're done growing long before 18 years of age. It's okay though -- embrace it. I'm 5'1" and have been since I was 10-11 years old (I'm almost 26 now). :)
You generally stop growing two years after your first period. Sometimes you grow some more. But it depends, your most likely done growing, you could maybe put on an inch or two but that's it. Three inches is a lot for your age.
Depends on your genetics, you usually stop growing between 18-21
Men usually stop growing around age 22
Call a doctor or the hospital emergency department and ask them what to do. DO NOT get medical advice from random strangers online. That's stupid.
Doing something stupid, I'm sure.
You're just gonna have to kill yourself, it's the only other option
do nothing and you'll be fine
It also has a clear discharge from it but there is no pain or blessing but a decent sized chunk of skin came off
You might want to visit the doctor aye. Sounds like the early stages of gangrene. You may lose your foot.
Some birth control pills will make them bigger, but you really shouldn't take them for that side effect. 36c is pretty big anyway, especially depending on your weight and height, like you said. Do you wear push up bras? You can try that, too, but it's just for show, of course.
Cosmetic surgery. There is no other way, just like you cannot make your foot bigger, or your head bigger, or your finger bigger.
You can order thick bra padding online. Surgery will cause harm to your back. I know many large breasted women who had reduction surgery so they wouldn't suffer the horrid pain.
Surgery, gain weight or get pregnant. I wouldn't advise any of these as you are probably just fine the way you are.
Your usual GP or, if you want to see a specialist doctor, a Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgeon. Alternatively, you may be just as well off, or even better, by seeing a physiotherapist. It depends on what sort of pain/injury you have with your knee.
I'd just go to your normal gp. When I had a knee injury I went to my normal gp and they referred me for scans and to a physiotherapist
Regular doctor first then orthopedic
a general practitioner at first,then,if it's considered necessary,a traumatologist
see a regular doctor
One that's qualified
Proctologist b/c that's a pain in the butt!
Without passing judgment, I would respectfully say that before you embark on this new life style, sit down with yourself and evaluate why you wish to do this. If this is a gender identity issue, you may want to talk to a trusted doctor first. If this is just a fetish, it's important to keep it healthy and keep it private. At all costs...avoid any wardrobe related to your mother. Seperate the two forms of thought here.
Just go to the store and buy it. If it is something that must be tried on, bring it home, and exchange it if it doesn't fit. People buy gifts for others every day.
Consider it from your own mental health point of view and whenever you want to write such stories, you should know how to imagine or dream. Nobody will like to sell such ideas to you. It is a Trade Secret.
online or you can stereotypically disguise yourself into a guy just buying clothes for his "girlfriend" as a gift. you can go to stores like victoria secret to buy bras and its not unusal for men to go in there because alot of men get them for gifts for there girlfriends
Internet or go to the store and say it's for your mom. No one will look at you weirdly.
Car boot sales Or make your own
garage sales Goodwill. Or go into a store with a list and hand it to the sales clerk. (It's not for you...it's for your mum!)
just go to the store, they have seen it all before so dont worry
online
The internet buddy
Probably not... it was just one day. That would be sort of weird if you just ate a lot of bread for one day and the next you have gained weight? No! But if you do this regularly as a part of your daily diet, then yes, you will gain weight.
White bread and whole grain are actually the same. And you need help because you are obsessing about food and obviously not getting proper nutrition. You can't function without carbs calories and fat everyday.
Probably. Switch from White bread to whole grain....and you can have 4 slices a day.
Yes. You will be the biggest fat *** on the planet.
No idea, also the act of releasing urine is peeing. Just some slang term most likely. But "I have to pee" sounds better than "I need to go make water" or I need to release urine".
Whether "pee" as a term for urine came first or the childish name for the penis of "pee pee" is rather a "chicken and egg" question. Clearly the two are related. I think that "baby talk" first led to the penis being called the "pee pee" and from that what it expelled came to be called "pee" and the action of doing so "peeing".
Because urine sounds gross and it's too long to say. It's two freaking syllables. Pee is one syllable. Ain't nobody got time for that!!
I believe it's onomatopoeia. Someone thought that urinating made the sound "peeeee..."
It is so much more exciting that way. I live in Chicago where we have more street murders every day than in Iraq. I have found bodies and have been shot at. I just can't get enough of it. My Dad was in WW2 and got 4 battle stars. I bet he found war exciting as well. I hope the violence picks up where you are so you do not die of boredom.
Go away troll.
Just your average liberal
You are a total idiot.
go away you halfwit.
That is sick.
If this is interfering with your daily life, and it sounds like it is, go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
See a psychologist and/or counselor first. If you end up seeing a psychiatrist instead, he/she is liable to prescribe you some powerful---and expensive---drugs that you will NEVER get off of.
There are more than 16 DIFFERENT types of breast cancer. Which type did your biopsy indicate? Have you been told these spots are cancer or are you guessing? As a mother of young children (9 months, 18 months and 3 years according to your other questions) these could just be calcified milk. it is uncommon for breast cancer to occur in both breasts at the same time. If tou do get diagnosed with breast cancer, why would you let it go untreated when treatment success rates can be as high as 99%, depending on stage?
Please don't say no to treatment. You won't live very long.... My father didn't want treatment for his breast cancer either....changed his mind at the last minute....now an 18 year survivor, and had stage 3 Breast Cancer...not worth not giving it a shot at treatment. Why die when you don't have to?
Depends on how fast it metatastisizes and how far. Cysts and tumors are not necessarily cancerous. Wait for the biopsy rests before planning your wake. Even if they ARE cancerous, at least they were caught early on, and the earlier the treatment of cancer, the better the odds of survival.
It depends on the cancer. And how you respond. Change your lifestyle and diet, cut out all sugar carbs, (cancer needs sugar) only organic foods. Your body is made to fight cancer, help it out by feeding your immune system the right fuels.
Ultrasounds aren't given for spots ON your breast.. Kinda young for a mammo aren't you?
Impossible to guess as some grow and spread slowly some very fast.
It is perfectly fine to masturbate 2-3 times a day. there are no negative side effects from this.
No side effects to masturbation. Average rate is at least once daily.
dangers, chances oh getting gaught are 2-3 times a day
It will bring you closer to death since you're losing life force. You're going to die if you keep masturbating
many wan kers favor masterbating to sex with people
Yes, you could. Anyone can! People of all shapes and sizes are models. There is even a girl with Down syndrome who is a model. Go find yourself an agent!
That's impossible tell without a picture. That being said, there is a trend to cast more "normal" looking models.
There are many different types. Get an agent. Save for your professional portfolio.
there's not too much need for a blue avatar
Yes
Eating pizza evey day would probably increase your acne. But in reallaty all the research that I've done tells me that acne has to do with our genetics and hormones. Thanks mom and dad!!! I've found something called bevoline. This has really work for me. I'm extremely happy with it!
Use a different soap.
Hello Jayden! It must be a form of OCD! It is very weird indeed, but as long as it’s not harming you, there is nothing to worry about. Do note that liquids do not have to be chewed before swallowing as they are already in a digestible form. Meat, vegetables and other hard food would on the other hand have to go through the grinding process. Do consult a doctor for a better diagnostic!
It's weird, but certainly is not harmful. Though I don't know why you would do it. Water and other drinks don't need to be chewed, as they don't need broke down to smaller bits and mixed with saliva to be swallowed.
Weird. Water doesn't need to be chewed.
Why are you chewing it? Chewing is usually to break food apart and mix it with saliva so it's easier to swallow. Water has nothing to break apart and does not have to be mixed with saliva to be easier to swallow.
unnecessary waste of energy chewing and time but it's okay :D
It's possibly abnormal (some people do it, many don't) but it's not harmful.
It is weird and needless, the friction of teeth against each other may cause harm to them.
must take you a while to drink a full glass of water
Try boxer briefs, American eagle in particular, they look good ( on me at least ) and come in lots of colors and designs.
I actually wear nike (could be any brand) compression shorts every day. A lot of people just wear them for sports but I also have a lot of friends that do the same as I do. They feel really good and hold everything in place so stuff isn't bouncing around when exercising
I wear boxers but in the past I've work boxer briefs. I switched to be red because I see so many guys wearing boxers. They are mainly American eagle brand any all different kind of colors/prints.
Most of the guys at my school wear Aeropostale boxer briefs. They are comfortable, fashionable, and good for gym class. Color depends on what you like, but black or blue are good choices.

Depends on the dose. Anything of too much can be bad for health. Coconut oil is the latest favorite faddy food for the health junkies at the moment. It's more about marketing of an appeal than sustainable eating. These products are expensive. Exclusive to those who are willing to believe the marketing and have the cash to support it.
Coconut oil is healthier than palm oil.
they are both excellent oils with great temperature limits and medium chain fatty acids......
it's prescription
There are many dictionaries online, but you prefer to come here and make yourself look like an idiot. Good thinking. <---- Sarcasm, ... you are probably too dumb to recognize it without being told.

LOL. Thanks for the laugh! PREscription.
Depends on amount and duration of the radiation, often targeted radiation is used on the prostate to "kill" prostate cancer. But certainly unexpected radiation exposure or too much (like numerous x-rays in a short time) might even cause cancer cells to form.
In prostate cancer radiation is used to reduce the size of any tumors and sometimes also to treat any bone pain if the cancer has spread. It can lead to erectile dysfunction and urinary symptoms such as incontinence, frequent urination, or bleeding. It will vary from person to person, depending on the dosage used and the purpose of the radiation treatment. You really need to ask your doctor what to expect in your particular situation.
Radiation cause tissue to die off..
Makes your balls grow bigger like that South Park episode
Makes it glow in the dark.
Giggles, that's what it's called
Maybe it's a certain thought comes into your head once in a while that makes you laugh.
sounds like hormones too me
HAHAHAAHAHA
That, to me, just sounds like a normal cold. Check if your lymph nodes are really swollen, if they are then probably go and see a doc because you may have an infection. In the meantime, if it's just a sore throat then take some chest medicine, down some cough sweets (within reason haha) and relax. Wait a maximum of 5 days I reckon and if the symptoms are still present then book an appointment.
I am having the same issue. Yes you should see your doctor. It could be tonsillitis or strep.
sore - painful soar - to fly in the air like a bird
I would go to the dr. Just in Chase strep or something serious
This tends to be very common in people with gastrointestinal disorders, especially if this happens very frequently. If this is just once in a while, then you could chalk it up to indigestion. For anything occurring on the long-term scale (a couple weeks or more), I would recommend to see your gastroenterologist, as there could be an underlying problem with your digestive system. Unfortunately, it s hard to pinpoint what could be an exact cause, since there are many possible things that could cause it which have the same symptoms.
Do you live around a power plant? Radiation sickness, and heavy metals in water can cause this. Fibromyalgia can cause this. PTSD and other ANXIETY disorders can cause this. Hypothyroidism, excessive alcohol or liver disease can also cause it. Ulcerative Colitis, GERD, so many things.. If you continue to be dehydrated, you must get to an ER. The IV of saline is a pain and frankly very cold, but life saving.
See Dr as nd nutriniosts. Go on you tube look up Dr lee probiotics. Excellent video about nutrition and how your stomach gers this way. Pls watch entire video much cheaper than nutrionist. However also see Dr to rule out any physical proplems. I think this will help you a lot.
See a doctor. You feel hungry because you aren't eating. You are tried because you aren't eating. You get headaches from dehydration. You need to figure out why you can't eat.
Pouch style, no fly low rise briefs-- like wearing nothing at all, ride low and comfortable on the waist, and the pouch is roomy yet holds the gear up and out in front-- enhances the bulge a bit as well. So no bouncing around like boxers, and way cooler temp wise-- and looks much better too.
Real men don't ask others what type of underwear they should wear. If you can't figure out that on your own, then ask your mommy.
I don't wear underwear.
I wear boxer briefs, just like that snugg fitt
I am a straight 14 year old boy that loves to go without underwear, and the only time i have been doing it recently is in pe class in school. Most days i have been freeballing it to school and my mum doesn't have a clue. Gonna do a massive zipline this weekend (freeballing of course) and my mum or dad don't know i freeball. If you were my parents would you let me do this or would you let your own kid do it?
I wouldn't let a child go without underwear or boxer shorts to school because many types of pants, especially jeans will let other kids see the child's privates underneath the fabric. That is why underwear was invented, to hide those things
Yes I would let my sons freeball. It's a very liberating feeling. I free ball occasionally. Just a warning since you are new to this. Zippers are your enemy now and don't underestimate their ability to injure you.
It's not important
I've reduced my calories by about 500 calories, and I have been eating wayy too much lately. I can't do anything involving a machine, weights, jump rope, you get the point I hope! What are some ways I can lose weight in my thighs,fast? I'm fully committed, I'm willing to anything I can do with the limited supplies I have.
You can reduce but not specify in advance. You'd still have the same shape. When I lost twelve lbs, my thighs lost an inch or more in circumference. Losing weight and abductor, adductor machine or side leg lifts.
I am a tea lover. I drink green tea, black tea, follower tea, ice tea... This is my first time to drink herbal weight loss tea. The taste is not bad. I drink one cup everyday. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product did make me a little bit lighter. I will keep drinking it to see what happens to me in long run .
You will begin to think clearly. Your face will clear up and you will feel stronger. Your eyesight will be better and you will not have that semen smell that is so obvious to everyone but you. You will have more radiant skin. You will feel better. Good luck.
None that i can think of- porn is not necessary to view, but regular ejaculation is good.
Pretty good if you are over 80. < M
You wont go blind or develop hairy hands.
I smoked Newport 100s cigarettes in 18 years old. But now I want to quit smoking.
I was around 6 years old. My cousin and I hid inside a huge bush/plant and smoked it.
I never smoke, but I have seen people who start smoking when they were in 6th grade.
Cigarette when I was 15 years old on Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph.
never
When I was still not born I've already been smoking weed.
12 years old
Per day is the accepted usage. Per a day could be correct, but is not generally used.
The definition of per is "for each", therefore per a day is incorrect.
Per means "for every" or "each." Since it makes no sense to say "for every a day" or "each a day," you can see why "per day" is correct, and "per a day" is incorrect.
Depending on the context it is usually per day, hope this helps
you are not here to please anyone but yourself in a healthy way if you eat fruit and vegetables and healthy solids and drink a lot of water you will be fine you will get people calling you names but do not let that get to you I was bullied badly when I was only 9 years old and still get it but I am still here because I know I have people who loves me and most importantly try not to stress about it
don't go down the anorexia route again - ever if you need to lose any weight (but I am sure you look fine) just walk a couple of miles - you can eat what you want , you need to take iron
The only way to get rid of your baby fat is too reduce your calories. 800 calories per day is not anorexic because real anorexics have less than 500 calories per day.
Sex is a natural action with two persons developed by natural instinct. Begin the process with pleasing talks kissing touching embrace fondling and finally come to the intercourse. Just at the end of quick action, moving forward and backward there is the apex feeling the ecstasy or most happy feeling every cells of the body that is orgasm.
its like when you get that feeling of wanting to sneeze and then it passes and you're almost disappointed that you didnt sneeze, then it comes back and you do sneeze and it feels so good hahah its a climax so its a feeling that just builds and builds until you explode. very hard to explain but its the best feeling.
a climax of sexual excitement, characterized by feelings of pleasure centered in the genitals and (in men) experienced as an accompaniment to ejaculation
It is something many men cannot give their partner.
Its any living creature.
Passing gas rn bby
Honestly speaking and to be frank with you, I have no idea. I have seen others doing such mischief and squarely putting the blame on me. Am I a lame duck. I don't think so.
No, but I have passed gas while in class.
Yes. I like to emit an extremely loud fart with a $hit-like smell everytime, especially during dinner ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
its a natural thing...If you stop passing gas then would be trouble for you...and genuinely I do this many times when standing near to a sitting person...to give them a purified gas.........hahahaha
Happened today at Joe's crab shack it was very loud.
Probably. It's something that happens to everyone. The trick is to know how to control it.
Yes, Sometimes it does happened.
Nope but I happens to me every time I finish having sex
No and I sure never did it in yoga bcuz yoga endangers Christianity
Some do, some don't. It depends on the person. A person is not going to change just because of rehab. Generally, they need something to force them to change. Additionally, they need to want to change, or all the rehab in the world is useless.
Sometimes. It is really up to the person. The individual has to really want to stay sober or clean, and must be willing to work at it. From what I have seen and read it takes about four or five attempts at rehab for many people to be successful with it.
basically - yes despite multiple claims by agencies and rehab clinics
Many of them have a high percentage of success.
some do, some don't...it matters how much hope they can see
So I'm a girl (16) and I've been running 5 times a week for about 40 mins and lose max 400 calories (I've been doing that for a month and 2 weeks now) . I do other exercises but I can only spit weight loss in my bottom area and not my hips. I really wanna burn some of my hip fat but it's still there. I'm 54 kilos and I'm 5'5 tall.
Do you eat a healthy diet? Your figure is only 30% your exercise routine and 80% your diet. If you eat healthily, then it's probably just your natural shape. Your hips will fill out during and after puberty. Hips are essential for childbirth, and this is the way the female body develops. You are certainly doing enough exercise, and you are not overweight, but if you feel out of proportion, or feel as though you aren't seeing results, talk to your doctor or hire a personal trainer. They will be able to give you advice on weight loss and specific exercises to target your problem areas.
Yes, running definitely helps to reduce fat overall.
It helps reduce body fat with a proper diet. You can't spot reduce fat though.
I am not sure how you would be upside down in the shower to begin with, especially while masturbating. But if you are able to do this it would be something worth seeing. It is neither normal or abnormal. It is just something that you enjoy.
By the definition of the word, that is abnormal. Most people don't do that. Just don't slip while you're in there, and clean up.
Not really but y you do upside down, standing up was better and more sexier. I may laugh at you if i saw you like that. Just stand or sit bro.
Yep. But bats do it upside down in the rain. < M
I don't Think so, that actually sounds pretty fun lol
Nope it s not I jerk off in the bathtub.
No, but would be an interesting picture to take. Seems awkward.

Hey whatever works for you.
whatever floats your boat man, if it feels good do it, well done for holding your balance!.
So im a female 22 years , i want to go to the military its always been my dream.. But i have a couple of Problems. (1) I have a boyfriend that i live with how do i tell him? (2) Im overweight lol im 5/6 and i weigh around 200 pounds. (3) i didnt finish highschool but i want to get a hsd somewhere online but couldnt find anything reliable.. Anyone have any advice
Tell your bf your dream. Whether he is happy for you or not is his problem, this is your life, not his. See what community colleges/night schools are on in your area for adults. You can probably get advice from human services if a google search doesn't help. I lost weight by keeping a food diary and by eating low-carb, high-fat. Plenty of websites/blogs/social media pages about this (with great recipe ideas). Basically cut all grains and sugar and enjoy using butter and cream and eggs again. I have lost about 15kg, have more energy, and nicer hair and skin. Plus it is easy. I don't count calories and the food is yummy!
Start with biggest thing. Get ur GED. Get one n two years learning in community colleges. Figure 30 - 45 credit hours. Visit BMI sites for actual info on suggested height weight. Figure goal of 150 and less. Visit libraries for books on how to lose weight, how to build muscle, how to PASS military minimum exercise requirements. Get ALL that - the "boy"friend probably be Gone. U will have OUT grown him. No problem.
First, get your GED. I don't think the military wants high school dropouts. Talk to your local school district to see if they have classes you can take to prep for the test. I don't know how fit you'd have to be, but you sure would lose weight in basic training. Don't even worry about your boyfriend right now. You're not going anywhere for a while.
No they don't. I heard some rumours but the charms have some chemicals dangerous but nothing to worry about
I don't think so
no
You expect to be texting or getting a call during surgery that you would HAVE to answer ?? Don't be ridiculous. Cataract surgery isn't done by laser either btw.
When I had my cataract surgery - all of items were put in a hospital type bag. It is surgery - no distractions !
LISTEN BRO, YOUR CELL PHONE IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS UR EYE HEALTH. ANYWAYS, YOU WILL MOST LIKELY HAVE TO PUT IT AWAY IN A LOCKER THEY ASSIGN FOR YOU (A LONG WITH ALL OTHER BELONGINGS)
I'm sure that won't be a problem if you don't mind going through the rest of your life blind.
You will be so far out of it that it won't make any difference... "Hold-On, I have to take this call ..... "
Good freaking grief. What an IDIOT.
A selfie stick is fine, but not the straw. Never put anything sharp inside you,
I wouldn't use those just because that is not their intended use, and it may not be safe to (parts might fall off, etc). If I were you, I would just buy the dildo, and keep it in an extremely inconspicuous space, such as an old purse, or behind a book on the shelf.
You should not be inserting anything into your vagina,especially not selfie sticks or straws. Women do not orgasm by vaginal penetration, we orgasm by clitoral stimulation. To have a great orgasm you need to rub your clitoris gently in small circles until you orgasm
Use a hairbrush handle, a sawed off mop or broom handle, a dust brush handle, a carrot trimmed to look like a penis.
for a woman, the clitoris is the source of an orgasm. And i wouldn't be sticking things up inside yourself unless whatever it is, is very clean.
Get the pet pooch lo lick your clitoris
Start sleeping on your couch from here on out, that's what I do. I have to sleep on my couch, whenever I get a hard on I just squeeze it in between the cushions on the couch that I'm laying on so that it doesn't lift my body when I'm trying to sleep. If you're having similar issues I would recommend doing the same.
Sleep on it the other way and it should bend back.
Sleep on it the other way.
Well that happens all the time around here.
Just kys
It happens. ~Aizen

I am going to my boyfriends house of Saturday and we plan to have sex and I need to bring the condoms but I do not know how to discreetly bring them. I would typically put them in my jacket but it is going to be like 28 degrees celcius and wearing my coat would be odd. I am not the girliest girl ever and I don't typically carry a purse with me so it is weird for me to bring one to his house considering I wouldn't need much and the one purse I really have is huge. Any suggestions? Thanks
Do you... have pockets? I mean it's not like condoms take up THAT much space. Take them out of the box. You aren't going to need all twenty-four.
He's the guy and expects you to bring the condoms, bad start in this relationship, seriously.
In your shoe
No your body will not be able to ejaculate before the puberty has happened . Thats the whole point of puberty, a change from been a kid, to being a young adult.
No. You have pubic hair. If you can ejaculate you are ABOUT a year into puberty. May be yellow or clear to start with. < M
It can take a few months to be at full strength. Be patient. Puberty takes several years, not several months to complete.
no
no you can't, but puberty is a weird stuff, it is not omogeneous in the parts of your body (some start early, other later) and not at the same age or rithm in everybody. do 't worry, in a few months everything will adjust
First stuff is clear or a bit yellow. Later its more white. First stuff is sticky and like lube.
No,you cannt.
At 55 he probably as some problem with his prostate Its not your fault Tell him to see a doc I am 73 married for 50 yrs
Often at that age it happened because their hearts aren't in good enough shape. He needs to do a bit of cardio training to get himself back on track. Erections involve blood pressure. Blood pressure pills won't let you build up enough pressure while being active.
Could be prostate issues or onset of erectile dysfunction time for talk with his DR. at this age quite common. Plus it could be hormonal a very low testosterone level which he could supplements for either way time for a physical.
Viagra. Buy online no prescription.
Try and change things up and see if that won't help him. Do you ever initiate sex, you get on top?
This is quite common for men of that age.
I was doing homework at midnight but then I hear (no word of a lie) the bed shaking like mad. Like proper thumping in bed. I open my door and I hear lots of breathing 'eh eh' then it stopped and I hear so much Kissing then I hear my dad say 'I felt it last a bit too long'. This happened literally 5 mins ago and I'm so fricken shocked can't focus on homework or sleep what shall I do. I'm 15 and they are in their mid forties...what do I do?
So, now you know your parents have a sex life. It does happen you know. Even (shock! horror!) people aged in their 70s and 80s are still at it, you know. It's normal, natural and healthy.....and 'good on them' for still enjoying that side of life and their relationship. Or did you honestly think your parents only ever had sex the once when they conceived you?!? (It's like those sex toy adverts on TV when they say they'll send you your order in discreet packaging. Why?!? Heaven forbid the postman should know you have a sex life!!)
Well. Starting I'm 13 and I experienced this quite a while ago, don't bother letting it run thru your head because it is normal and happens all the time to younger people around our age, you should also try listening to music while chewing gum when that happens because gum helps you focus on one thing and music let's out the best part of yourself.
Be grateful your parents have a normal sex life and still enjoy each other. Start to worry if they stop enjoying each other because there may be a divorce in their future. In future,when they retired to bed, put on your headphones and listen to music.
Well it already happened there's nothing you can do lol. You think you have it bad? I walked in on my parents while they were in action! Just forget it even happened, I mean, that's how you and the rest of us were made! To distract yourself just watch some fun YouTube videos! :)
Now you know the Stork didn't really bring you. LOL Forget about it it's part of life. It's neat your parents love each other and have a full happy life.
I am not sure why this bothers you. Do you equate sex with being sinful? Is it just the noise that bothers you? What exactly is the problem? Maybe you should sit them down and explain that while you live under their roof you will have none of that going on.
obviously they have sex, they're your parents. how do you think you came into the world? do you think people stop having sex when they have a child? no...get over it
Go about your business and pretend you heard nothing. Buy a pair of earplugs for future evenings at home.
You don't do anything. People have sex, including the parents of teenagers. It is normal.
Hi, I turned 13 in February (just recently) and I'm 161 cm (a little above 5'3"). I haven't had a growth spurt yet at all, and most girls in my class are like 5'5" and have already had theirs. My mom is about 5'4" and my dad is about 5'11" or 10" . most of my family are quite tall but some are short. I haven't started my period yet so is it possible for me to reach 5'10" or 5'9" when I finish growing? Pls help
Being that height is fine! I'm 15 and only about 5"4, all of my friends are either the same height or taller than me. Even most of the year 7s are taller than me so don't worry, you might grow soon! As I was always taller than my cousin then one day he shot up and now he towers over me! Just be happy with your height! Short it cute!
Right now you're in about the 55th centile for growth, which, if you're curious, is actually slightly tall for your age, since it means you are taller than 55% of the other 13 year olds out there. To end up at 5'9" you'd be in the 97th centile... meaning you'd be taller than 97% of other women. It's one heck of a jump. Certainly stranger things have happened but I'd be kind of surprised.
When you are measured at the doctor, they should chart it. The chart usually shows a growth pattern and can estimate approximate adult height. Remember that everybody has growth spurts at different times so somebody was 5'3" at age 13 could be a different height than somebody else in adulthood.
I'm 5'3" and 19, I was way shorter than you at 13. It's reasonable to say you could grow to somewhere between your parents' heights, but I ended up shorter than my mum so who knows.
Since your dad is only about 5'11" I would have to guess you won't get much taller than him. Chances are you'll be between you mom and dad's height.
No. You'll stop by 15. Possibly before. Your father is average height your mother below. You won't be tall.
- short stature decrease risk of 'venous insufficiency' source : 'tall' in http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/... - shorter stature, is more resistant against cancer, diabetes, aging source : 'resistant to cancer and diabetes and are somewhat protected against aging.[6][12][13] This is consistent with findings in mice with a defective growth hormone receptor gene.[7]' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron_synd... - shorter stature need lower blood pressure to stay alive, lower blood pressure is healthier source : 'Because smaller animals (for example rats) function at a lower blood pressure, they need less oncotic pressure to balance this, and thus need less albumin to maintain proper fluid distribution.' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albu...
Highly unlikely. You will probably be a little taller than yoour mother but no more than 5ft 6
Uh.... Well. The guy really is a hero, and not because he whipped out his own piece. If you read the article, there's very little in the way of partisan issues, until you get to the end: "I think he must have some sort of mental health issues and it goes to show the effect of the cuts to mental health services. " I think that makes this story a Conservative nightmare. Not only does it show that anyone with a gun can cause mayhem anywhere they want, it also highlights that the conservative ideal of cutting healthcare funding helps to create societal problems in very specific ways.
I would like to make an America where people are forced to take a bullet for their family less often, rather than one where we glorify the heroism of people forced to make avoidable tragic decisions.
Man what is with you people and your insatiable need to promote your childish fantasy world that ignorantly claims that Cons are big and strong and brave and all Libs are small and weak and cower in fear ?
I've got another gun story for you. Twelve-year old T.J. Darrisaw was trick-or-treating with his family. He knocked at Quentin Patrick's door. Patrick believed he was being robbed, so he sprayed the door with nearly 30 rounds from an Ak-47, killing Darrisaw and injuring his 9-year old brother and father. http://www.nbcnews.com/id/27482694/ns/us...
sorry but your need to demonize liberals has caused you to form an idea of liberals that is not based on reality
This has nothing whatever to do with liberals except in your fevered, brainwashed mind.
I'm still puzzled why they aren't married.
The story is BS. Never happened.
This has nothing to do with liberals.
There are. No one uses them. Ladies (or gay men) looking at them would expect a flood of ejaculate. When they got a trickle, they'd realize they'd been tricked. You CAN get an implant if you lose one (or both): http://theturekclinic.com/services/male-mens-sexual-health/testis-prosthesis-testicular-implants-prosthetic-testicle-testicular-testical/ And your dog can get some after he's fixed: http://www.neuticles.com/

because balls are ugly
ever since I was a little kid I struggled with weight. recently since all my friends have been obsessed with being skinny and losing weight it s all I can think about. I know I m the fattest one in my friend group and I cry every day and literally want to kill myself. I ve started counting calories like crazy and trying to eat less. I m becoming anorexic. once I get to my goal weight I ll stop though. any advice?
Lose weight slowly and think about health rather than weight. Use portion control, consider calories, eat mostly unprocessed foods, stay away from sugar or too much oil, and do some enjoyable activities. If you are active, allow yourself to eat more protein, carbs and calories than when you aren't. You can use nutritiondata.com to learn about foods and determine how many calories you need in a day.
You should stop thinking about it. It doesn t matter how you look.If someone doesn t accept you for what you are then you shouldn t even care about them. You should start a hobby like martial arts or go to the gym so you will forget the whole thing + you will loose weight and learn new things
Get new friends, more interesting ones. Seek help from a psychiatrist.
No. It's a sexual fetish called bestiality. It's a crime in many States. In some of those States it's a felony. No, having sex with animals isn't "normal." I'd spend less time measuring my penis and showing it to your male cousin and dog and more time with a mental health therapist.
No, it is not. You need to see a psychologist ASAP.
Not normal at all.
no im sorry its just not normal

Yes you are overweight. You should try to lose weight. You'd look great at 110 lbs.
You may be a very little overweight, but certainly not much, and maybe not at all if you are muscular. You should not focus on losing weight. Instead focus on being fit and strong and healthy.
Lose weight
5'4 133 lbs is NOT overweight. not even a little bit. not sure why the other answers are saying that for.
Well I'm 21 now and I know I jerk off about 2/3 times a day! Even on the days I get layed!
I never did when i was 18, i got laid every 2-3 days, i had a girlfriend back then.
It is better and very safe to masturbate every alternate days without any guilt. you can enjoy the act. regards.
At least once a day.
As often as they can-- average is at least once a day. Like all teens.
Probably about every day if not multiple times per day
2 or 3 times a day or possibly more....testosterone is a real biotch...
as much as possible

Pre diabetes is a warning sign that if you dont change diet and do exercise it wont be long before you are a diabetic and once diabetic you take medication, healthy diet and exercise to keep levels normal but will always be diabetic - I wish I have listened to doctor when I was pre diabetic, Good Luck
A pre-diabetic does NOT have diabetes. It's that simple. With diet and/or prescriptions a diabetic is still diabetic. It is INCORRECT that a "diabetic" can be "cured" with "only diet." Absolutely not true. Diabetes means that " ... a person's ability to produce or respond to the hormone insulin is impaired, resulting in abnormal metabolism of carbohydrates and elevated levels of glucose in the blood and urine."
If you need pills(or shots) to be a "normal" then you are diabetic. If you can normalize with only diet - then you are not diabetic. I think I was misunderstood by someone. I didn't mean if you are diabetic that you could cure yourself with diet alone. I meant if you are pre-diabetic and you can normalize yourself with diet - you're not diabetic. As a diabetic you can sometimes decrease the need for pills or shots but you are always going to be a diabetic.
I think she felt disappointment for me when I did my Spanish project super duper late. I asked if she wanted to check it out when we were in the classroom after school and she said no, some other time. I was surprised because she would usually say yes. I think she was dissapointed in me as a son and wanted to discipline me by doing that. She asked later before leaving the classroom how my project went and I told her that it was pretty good. And she said "Then you learned nothing from that huh?"
Your teacher is probably fond of you, but doesn't want to cross boundaries and be your parent. That would get her into trouble, confuse her family, and in fact confuse you. So, I think she understands that she is playing an important role in your life, but probably sees you more as someone who is very special in her life, but not as a son. If you want to maintain a good relationship with her, try to respect her, and accept that you can have a special place in her heart, but will not be her son.
I wish I got my teachers to think of me that way. Some of them were so hot I couldn't help but want to f**k them.
no this is not a oral cancer its just a infection. don't eat the thing who include a red chili and spicy things. used ice cream and contact to physician for better treatment.
Sounds more like an abcess.
Sounds like he may have injured his tongue on his growing molars.
He has an ulcer or canker, not cancer..
see a doctor or a dentist to be sure
I see you've been using Prolargentize Penis Pills. Only prolargentize can guarantee a man a 27 inch penis. If your bothered by your massive man meat please ask your doctor to remove six or eight inches and donate them to the TinyMeat Foundation For Men. They will find a man with Tinymeat ad transplant your gianormous pecker onto him , helping him to satisfy women for the first time in his life.
Your also a liar. The man with the largest penis was measured at about 15 inches. And 100 inches girth is not humanly possible.
Yes, it's normal.
Yeah, if you're an elephant.
There are no pills for growth unless a doctor has prescribed certain growth hormones. But readily available products claiming to increase height are fake.
LOL.... there is no such pill "for grow"
no such pill exists
a lot, don't
Plantar fasciitis
I have a soft cast on and a sock near my heal et it is still very sore.
What activity were you engaged in?
Too much hiking?
I've been sneaking to his house at night and my two best friends know. But yesterday I went and ended up sucking his dick. My friends don't even know I've kissed him yet. I really wanna talk about it but he told me not to tell anyone. Should I tell my two best friends? I'm 15 btw which is young don't judge plzzz.
Unless you can really trust your friends and you guys are all open about these things then yea sure why not lol but if you have to question it wither you should talk to them about it or no then maybe you shouldn't you never know if one of those friends maybe fake and if you give them personal information like that they can always use it against you unless of course you could give 2 *****
Young sure As long as you dont have sex, cause that is illegal. Honey only do what you wanna do. Never do what he makes you do. I dont know his age but if he is over 18 he is a criminal if he makes you do this. So tell your friends for sure, just so they know where to go look for you when you never come home.
why do you need to tell someone? would telling them change anything? do you just do everything they do instead of living your own life? what would telling them about your illegal sex life accomplish, except you potentially ending up in jail...
A. It is none of their business B. Why is this listed under computer security?
you should keep it to yourself-you are underage and he could get into a lot of trouble if someone blabs
yes
High white blood cell count generally means an infection. Go and get it treated before you give it to your children. Thyroid imbalance can cause all sorts of vague symptoms but is generally easily treated.
When someone has a high white blood cell count because of leukemia, it is very high. One point over means absolutely nothing- one point over is not even usually indicative of infection.
Your choice. Find out if there's something that needs treatment or wait and hope there's nothing. If that's wrong then you may affect your chance of recovery by the delay.
It could and I would suggest going back to your doctor to be safe
You posted that you are 14 four days ago...
no
It is probably a pimple. By the way, what you describe isn't your vagina. Sounds like the pimple is on your mons veneris.
It is probably just an ingrown hair.
well that sounds like syphilis to me and requires a visit to a doctor

Well over 6' tall. You're the height of a 14 or 15 year old now.
Your parents are the dominant influence. You'll stop round 16
Generally the height of an offspring is somewhere between that of their parents - but you might get some effect of the other genes in your family.
No way to tell, just wait and see.
Yes your fine. 3 inches is enough to give a woman an orgasm.
A 4.5 inch penis is not to small for sex. But this could be a matter of opinion or personal preference. If you have a 4.5 inch erection and your partner wants bigger, your size will be a problem. Some people want their partner to have a smaller penis, especilly for anal and oral sex. Of course a 4.5 inch penis can be pleasureable. But again, this will depend on your partner.
That's only 1/2" off of average. Of course it won't make a difference.
Even if it's not enough there's nothing you can do about your penis size.Just use what you got to the best of your ability?
People always say size doesn't matter, lies. It does matter to a certain extent, just you are not too small for it
small but ok for sex
It works. But it is crap. Tell you the truth... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
I already used two and a half bottles and the product is meeting up to my expectations. My small friend became my big friend after this Prolargentsize herbal capsule. My wife noticed the difference in my penis, I didn’t say anything about my secret. I enjoy the result with my wife. I have just ordered the third bottle from Prolargentsize website.
One ejaculation is only about a tablespoon. And your penis becomes flaccid because you are done being aroused. Theres nothing to worry about.
Nothing wrong with your penis shrinking up. Just relaxing. Adult volume of semen ejaculated in one event is only about a teaspoon full.
Youll be fine
Its normal.
it is ok
So long as there is sufficient blood flow then nothing will happen. Its a guideline. If your penis begins turning blue or purple its time to take off the ******** and let it get some air for a few minutes and then you can put it back on.
As long as he isn't experiencing any pain, discomfort or numbness he will be alright. The 20 to 30 minute warning is for the uninitiated, but someone who has experience using them has generally learned how to wear them correctly and can do so much longer then the recommended period. One should be able to slip a finger through it anywhere around it, if you can't... then it is too tight and should be removed and a larger one should be used in the future.
Could cause circulation issues resulting in weaker erections.
Auto-castration probably. < M
no, has to call fire station to remove it :)
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
don't touch them till it recover.use egg white mask.it will give you a best result to get rid from pimples or you can also use pimple face wash for this problem
Easy, don't get them!
use Clearasil products , they are quite good .
That's not the point. The point is a predator, let's say it's a 18 year old guy, can just walk into the women's washroom and chill in there, and all he has to say is he's a trans woman and nobody can do anything because it's discriminatory against trans. That's why it's ****** up, nobody is saying that not allowing trans people to use the corresponding bathroom will stop sexual predators, however it will prevent them from being protected by the law.
ARE YOU THE STUPIDEST MOST IGNORANT DUMB MOTHER FCKER ON EARTH???? Do you even read your own drivel before you post? You're right, predators having legal access to their victim's in restrooms definitely won't "embolden" them. No offense, but I genuinely can't take you liberals anymore, your stupidity and complete pathetic-ness is absolutely mind boggling. F*ck you and the cess pool piece of sht family you crawled from. I wish I could kick your dad in the balls and sterilize him. Maybe I'd get a nobel peace prize for that.
It's like rapists and pedophiles weren't using the bathroom before or something. Perhaps they just enjoy their fantasies of them going after boys in the men's room more.

Yes, diabetes is a disease, and more specifically it is a metabolic disease. There is a significant genetic component in both types of diabetes mellitus. Just so you can do really well on your report, should you decide to use diabetes as your chosen disease, you might like to know there is another kind of diabetes; this one has nothing whatever to do with the pancreas or insulin---and it is called diabetes insipidus, just be careful you don't confuse the two. When talking about diabetes mellitus that is insulin dependent, you can use the standard medical abbreviation IDDM, and when talking about acquired diabetes or adult onset diabetes, you should indicate it by diabetes mellitus Type II
yes
No it is not it is a condition and not a disease
Yes, it is.
Yes, although I wouldn't call it a "disorder" simply a mental illness would be sufficient.
Yes when you need a note to get out of class or work.
Yes..if you find yourself regularly stress
I believe so
Okay so I think I may have a mental health issue but I've tried telling my parents and they do nothing, and whenever I talk with someone about it I bread down in tears. My school counselors say they will help but forget about me a week later. I've gone in 3 times each time breaking down into tears unable to return to class for half an hour. What should I do?! No adult is helping and I'm scared it may get worse
If you feel suicidal call the national suicide hotline. If you think you know exactly what it is that's wrong, chances are there's a hotline for it. That's the handy thing about the internet now a days. If you don't have a phone, but a computer, there's definitely people out there who would be willing to help you out with whatever's getting to you. Sometimes in the modern world it's hard to get the help you need, especially if your parents aren't supportive. If they won't do anything about it, take matters into your own hands.
All teens have mental health issues. It's your hormones.
I'm going through the same thing! I'm 15 so I'm a freshman. I'm bursting out in tears because schools dumb. Let's hang in there together
Yeah I do watch porn daily, I masturbate to it whenever I'm super horny, usually feel drained after
I took this technique from the movie "Don Jon" 1. Open computer 2. Search "porn gif" (if you want to get specific into it you're into you can type on "******** porn gif" or whatever) But you are just looking do not touch your d..k just yet. 3.once your ready find a video ( I like to use "porn hub") 4. Grab your lube, and stroker sleeve and have fun!! I do feel a little discussed with all the porn I watch but it fun! Ask me anything!
Sometimes I watch porn and masturbate. It feels good, but that is sorta the point of doing it, so yah...
I like to end my session without blowing my load. Blowing my load is only good temporarily. But I like to live life high on libido all day. It's how I roll. Porn keeps my interest up...but I must not blow it. Makes me very saaad. (I also aim to draw hentai and sh!t so ya)
i watch porn everyday before bedtime and after waking up and yeah i masturbate, its satisfying for me. idk if i am ryt but even im a guy i am enjoying watching gay porn, im curious of it i guess, btw im 18yo guy.
Millennials on Fox News's Bill O'Reilly's Watter's World said that there is no difference between men and women. Screw sexism, right? Oh wait, screwing does mean having sex, and having sex should not exist, right? It's just two people banging crotches that have nothing on them. Do babies come from storks, or what? I DON'T KNOW! DOES THAT MEAN WE COME FROM GOD?! OH WAIT, GOD DOES NOT EXIST, SO... I DON'T KNOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'M SO CONFUSED!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE HELP ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'VE LOST ALL MY BRAIN CELLS TRYING TO FOLLOW ALL OF THIS LOGIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME, BRILLIANT LIBERALS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Homework Assignment Look up the term Ambiguous Genitalia ...and get back to us
You don't really care what Democrats believe or why they believe it. You just want to yak away to let us know what you think.
Should not generalize. I am democrat and I have male genitals, my wife has female genitals. We know full well how they work.
Oh wow you're soo smart. So explain to us the 5 genders. Expert.
Come on that's not fair. They could care less about who they have sex with. Its sort of a "I'll take what I can get kind of thing"
So is your god a hermaphrodite? Many are, just like many people are born that way as well. Why have you abandoned the great God Loki?
I have no idea why you are posting such nonsense about Democrats. You certainly are confused.
An inside out Dick is still a Dick
100% Troll lol
Something is wrong if you are fearful with your man. Probably you are missing the commitment you need and should have before giving yourself away. Just e-mail me if you want to know how to build commitment into your relationship.
you should feel comfortable with your man and in the moment, not thinking of the fear and pain. this just shows you aren't ready to make love with him or he's just not the right one.
I think part of your trouble is that your hymen is not broken, you need to break your hymen before you attempt to have sex, you also need to learn how to give yourself an orgasm, this should also help you to relax
Why would there be pain? This is totally irrational.
Trial and error.

Once a day? That's not that much at all. Surely you've got 40 minutes a day to spare.
Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
Your definitely overthinking it , that's nothing dude, pretty normal
No, you keep that d!ck in shape and train that punching arm of yours.
It is grossly overthinking it. < M
i wouldnt
I masturbate too much and it's affecting my social life. PLEASE DO NOT start talking about how masturbation is healthy because I still wanna stop. I'm 18 and I know I'm young with lots of hormones but I wanna stop it, at least for a few months I'm addicted to porn also so how do I stop watching it? Any tips
Tip: Practice not masturbating.
Distract yourself...... If it's still very difficult to keep your mind off of it, then you'll have to see a therapist. Masturbation really is a healthy activity, but if you want me to shoot it straight with you, I gave you the answer.
Masterbate away, its ok. Its natural and healthy, if you dont masterbate your gonna **** your pants while you sleep after your body decides too much has built up. The porn addiction could use some help tho, maybe a porn addict therapy group?
Sounds like you reading too much religious NoFap propaganda is affecting your social life. I suppose you could have sex with all these women you are meeting in this enhanced social life you are having. < M
Rearrange the furniture. Put the bed conveniently near the door. When you masturbate scoot it against the door. The will be a confrontation from this. Since you're grown enough to masturbate you're grown enough to insist on PRIVACY! (Would he allow you to interrupt him and mom?) , , Simpler solution; visit a motel. Each room has an 'intrusion' lock, different from the doorknob or electric card-key lock. It's a metal 'toggle' on the frame that fits on a knob on the door. When the door is pushed the toggle loop slides against the knob and stops the door. USE your own money! (You might also "sweep" the room for cameras and electronic bugs; how does he know WHEN?
Ok, I'm going to tell you how I was able to masturbate when I was younger living in someone else's house. When it's time for you to bathe, run the water like you're filling the bath but don't put the stopper in. Make sure your bathroom door is locked and position yourself where your clitoris is in the direct flow of the water. It feels amazing and works every time. Then when you're done, just fill the tub and relax. I hope this helps because I know how it feels to always have prying eyes and eavesdropping ears. Enjoy! 😉
If you are in the bathroom lock the door if it has a lock on it. Or find a place where he can't walk in on you when you are trying to masturbate.
It seems odd that he keeps walking in. Just go in the bathroom, and pretend you're taking a dump. I'm sure he won't walk in then. Lol
Just don't masturbate at night. I mean he has to leave you to yourself sometime. You can masturabate in the shower or at night when your dad shouldn't be coming in.
It's perfectly natural. Just continue if he walks in. He will see what you are doing, nod his head and walk out to let you finish.
Lockthe door
If your bathroom has a lock go there, ordo it when your dad isn't in the house
Lock your door if you have a lock or go into a room where there is a lock.
Wait until he goes to bed and goes to sleep for the night. Then you get in your own bed, turn out the lights, and have at it!
Yes. A lot of people receiving oral sex but haven't had intercourse conclude that they are still virgins. HSV-1 (oral herpes) can be transmitted from the mouth to genitalia and can lead to genital herpes. This is rare, though; viruses do best in certain environments, like the mouth or lips. Keep in mind that it can happen, so always use protection when giving or receiving oral sex. It's also possible for a baby to be born with HIV if the mother is infected. HIV can be transmitted from mother to baby through pregnancy, childbirth, or breastmilk. Regardless, always use protection when having sex.
Yes. Just because it's called a Sexually Transmitted Disease doesn't mean that's the only way it can be contracted.
95% of STDs are also transmitted through blood to blood contact. meaning if you have a cut and someone else with a cut that has an STD touched cuts or shared blood they would be infected.... its not common to get an STD if you are not sexually active OR a drug addict (blood in the needles)
the only way that would happen is if your mother had an STD when you were born and she passed it on to you and you STILL had it, although it probably would have killed or crippled you by now without treatment
One of many examples of a church lying.
oly if they are newborn babies and were born from a mother with STD otherwise no
Disregard Merlin and Garrett. Boys should be able to freely pull the foreskin back anytime they want. It sounds like he just never has and it is stuck due to all the smegma and Gunk that is built up under there. He should have been pulling his foreskin back everyday and washing under there. Proper hygiene is everything.
Don't. That's it. Most boys' foreskin will retract by 18 a few are later. What you see in porno may not happen until 25+. He should be able to have sex if careful and uses lube. He does not need full retraction. < M
You don't do that- it may be still attached and pulling it back could rip it.
Oh my good lord. Can the stupidity on this site get any worse? Yeah, sure you are going to go blind. All eye doctors use lights in people's eyes to make them go blind. <--- SARCASM in case you are too much of an idiot to recognize it. Can you possibly be so damn STUPID? Yeah, obviously you can, and also it is obvious you have equally moronic friends. Like attracts like I suppose.
Eye doctors have to use bright lights to see inside the eye, but they know not to use so much light that it would cause permanent damage.
Your friend is an idiot. The bright light is used to get a closer look at the retina. It does not damage the eyes in any way.
Super tampons are for a medium flow. For a heavy flow you want Super Plus, or Super Plus Extra. Get tampons suitable for your flow, and you'll be fine.
Sorry but this can be normal. You need to use a super tampon and a pad at school. Take supplies in your bag.
Nothing is wrong but you may want to switch to super plus, instead of super. It's just a heavy period. unless you bleed through a super plus in less than one hour it is nothing to worry about.
It is because you are still growing, your body is still getting used to the hormones puberty is flushing into your system. It will be heavy for a while, and once you are older it should normalize and slow down a bit.
Talk to your mother about this problem. If it continues for the next few menstrual cycles, your mother can ask your doctor to prescribe the birth control pill. The pill will reduce the amount of flow and the duration of your periods, plus you won't have cramps.
It is really sad to hear your present plight. It is really unfortunate. It may be only due to some bad luck, bad time or fate. As a true brother, it is now your duty to give her proper and suitable advice. Don't trouble your parents at their old age. Take full responsibility on your shoulders.
ALWAYS tell your mom everything She needs professional help. Anxiety is easily fixed if she gets help.

Use lemon juice and rubbing alcohol and rub on your face where Acne forms. Do this twice a day for a couple weeks and it will improve drastically. The lemon will clean the skin of oil and the alcohol will dry it out causing less acne.
4 months ago I had literally 37 zits on my face. Now I have like 2. Just use "OXY ACNE MEDICATION" They sell it at Target and Kroger. It is the only thing that has worked for me. Use it once everyday it's a life saver.
I know how you feel. I went to my doctor and she prescribed creams and my pimples are almost gone. Don't waste your time with harsh face washes. Just use a gentle face wash (I recommend Cetaphil). They work better. So use a gentle face wash 2x a day and use creams the doctor gives you.
If everything else has failed and this really bothers you, then you should consult a dermatologist and see what they have to say, as they are more experienced and can provide a professional opinion.
I have done that many times and even recently so your premise is totally incorrect. Move on, dude.
It depends whether they strictly follow the established systems and procedures or rules and regulations for this job or not.

Like you just feel like turning an hour long run into a multiple hour run? Lately, I've been going trail running for 2 hours straight through. Following that, I go swimming for another hour. Then, I'll go cycling for about 6+ hours whatever route I want to take. After that, I'll go to a nearby climbing center until about 9pm. I go home, take a shower, eat (obviously), and fall happily asleep.

you don't feel like you would kill someone right? or have been thinking of doing so? then it's not harmful. unless you get these voices frequently, then it can be a problem. but sometimes we all hallucinate and hear strange things. think of why you heard that particular phrase. are you feeling angry towards someone? were you just bored? is it possible that it's a side effect of the meds you take? maybe not, so asking your psychiatrist is the best way to find out why this happened. all the best!!
I think it's time ⌚ to see a doctor 😷 so the doctor 😷 can prescribe some appropriate treatment such as referring you to a specialist mental health doctor 😷 also known as a psychiatrist - alternatively you can call 📞 the paramedics so the paramedics can take you to the hospital 🏥 in an ambulance - I'd highly recommend this before the chances of someone being hurt or may even recieve attention from law enforcement
You should go see a shrink and he could probably prescribe some medication for that
Absolutely. Add vegetables, fruit and at least double the water while you cut back on the alcohol and caffeine. Almighty God created a wealth of healthy live foods that can heal many ailments. In addition, you might be surprised how quickly you get rid of headaches by merely drinking plenty of water (64 oz. plus daily). Best regards.
It's possible, but I doubt it. Sounds like a decent diet, but you're lacking fruit and greens. Why you asking us?
Cut down on the whiskey and add some nutrients to your diet. Fruits and vegetables.
you need to eat some vegetables like leafy greens and such. potatoes and beans don't count. also you should incorporate some fruit.
Yeah whiskey never gave anybody headaches
yes, especially the coffee and whiskey you may have undiagnosed food allergies as well
If you'd had untreated cancer for "years," you'd be dead by now. Cancer is extremely rare at your age. You are suffering from hypochondria, not cancer. However, if you're really that scared and can't get a doctor's appointment, go to the emergency room (or A&E if you're in the UK) and tell them that you're in great pain. I find it very suspicious that after all this time, you can't get a doctor's appointment. You should at least be able to make one for some weeks from now. Have you tried calling yourself? You can do that, you know. Your aunt may think you're just being a hypochondriac and isn't really calling for an appointment.
Dear, I'm sorry you have all of thse fears, but the reality of your symptoms is NOT cancer at all. Chest pain has nothing to do with cancer. Lumps are something we all have. And many of us have 'feelings' that are just pure imagination.
Highly doubtful. Wait for your doctor's appointment and then panic.
If you've had that problem for years, you'd have a much bigger problem if it was cancer...
At least you're young, easier to care for it
unless you have been examined by a doctor and blood tests confirming anything, you don;t have cancer - go to a freaking doctor already
Sounds like you are overreacting
Speak to your mother.

Good example of why women are angry.. Don't sit there and judge someone for being ugly just cause you may not seem to be attracted to them, I'm sure not everyone thinks your a 10 either. Another thing God didn't put us on earth to be with one person. If someone choose that path great but I certainly find lots of people arousing and if I want them bad enough guess what I'll persure them. Thank you..
Yes. For your kind information, here mental health is only given highest predominance and emphasis and all other issues, topics, subjects or stories are secondary. Other things can be postponed. For the present maintain perfect mental health conditions. That is more than sufficient.
Yes, a better understand of the emotion of a women. The female emotion is always expressed in the same way as it has been expressed here.

Well, there could be multiple health effects. Do not be too alarmed as there could be nothing wrong with you. Just to be safe, if it continues seek medical attention. Semen is usually a white-ish grey colour and is thicker when ejaculated. It should liquefy within thirty seconds. if it is yellow there could be a few causes: Urine in the semen, jaundice or abnormally high levels of white blood cells (leukocytospermia)
That's normal. It can vary in color from borderline clear to yellowish. Just depends on the concentration of boys to seminal fluid. The more boys you got in there the more yellow it is.
because you stopped a week, it grew old
Its pee
once when I sneeze something squirted out of my eye onto my glasses - my point - its connected in there. She might spit it up too. She probably has real dry nasal passages that crack and bleed. Call your pediatrician's office and ask to speak to the nurse. Also - your insurance card probably has a number on the back to speak with a nurse.
Bring her to the doctor

The most HELPFUL thing you can do for your sister is to SQUEAL on her and tell your parents. Think about what would happen if your parents walked in one day and found her dead. Wouldn't you be MORE upset that you Knew and said nothing about it????? She "Thinks" she is fine, but believe me, she WILL try again. and that second time may be too late. She has already harmed her body by overdosing on Pills...guaranteed her health is going to fail quickly.
I am extremely sorry to read your statement/sentence. It is really unfortunate. It may be only due to some bad luck, bad time or fate. Because of this, if you have any genuine problem, please don't feel shy or hesitant to raise a solid question here. You will get plenty of best solutions from eminent scholars..
If you think she might try again, tell someone. Don't pressure her to tell you why she did what she did. Be supportive and show her that you are there for her and that you care.
Some adjustments can cause more soreness than others depending on the teeth the pressure is being placed on and the aggressiveness of the pressure being applied. This can sometimes last few days and then improve.
Some adjustments aren't too bad, others are worse. Don't worry, your teeth just have to adjust to the increased pressure, this usually takes 3 days and then you will be fine.
Yes, I have had braces before, if the doctor changed something you are not used to, it will hurt when you bite down.
Consult your dentist
i would call and ask the dentist

I do know that boys masterbate by themsrlf and with their best friends. But what else is normal for them? I walked in on them the other night when they thought I was out. I think they were doing more than masterbating each other. What is normal, and how do I handle all of this? I know some stuff in normal, but what is normal and what is not? Should I take him to talk to someone or is he OK? Mary
For a 13 year old, normal sexual behavior is NO sexual behavior.
Don't listen to Polish, masturbation is a completely normal part of growing up and some people even start when they're 10 years old! Your friends are probably just exploring with each other, some guys I know are straight yet they have no problem changing or masturbating around other guys. Don't feel weird if you do any of these things, they are completely expected for your age.
at 13 everything is normal, it is the age to start experimentations of all kind. let it be.
You show a few sociopathic tendencies but nothing too serious or dramatic. I wouldn't say you're a psychopath, but you could definitely pass for a sociopath. I don't know what age you are but if you at 11-20 it's likely it might get worse. I'm not going to recommend you seek help or anything like that but talking about it is definitely good. If you post a longer question I'll be happy to answer again.
That's a question that your doctors should have already discussed with you. Everyone is different and although lung cancer is among the most deadly, the effectiveness of cancer treatment will vary from person to person. My own Mother had been given 6 months to a year to live, she lived another 8 years after her initial diagnosis of small cell lung cancer.
How are you responding to chemo? Lung cancer is a tough nut. If you respond well to treatment, you could survive for many years. If you don't, then you could die in 6 months or a year.

Uh.....you're coming on HERE to find out your life expectancy??? Wow, that is very scary. talk to your oncologist.
Didn't you ask your onco?? At such a young age too... Kinda gave yourself away when you couldn't spell 'expectancy' and answered a question with, 'my dick'
Your oncologist should have already discussed that with you. If not, you should ask him.
Ask your oncologist
If we stand towards the back I don't see too much of a problem and there will probably be others smoking as well. Its in the UK. We are both 18 but it is youth worship so there will be quite a few young people there. We will share an order of service and join in with the songs and prayers etc. I just said to her that as long as she only blows smoke over me and no one else it should be fine.
You may be 18 but you don't sound mature enough to be allowed out on your own! If this is your biggest concern at the moment I'm happy for you.
Same as the last 100 times you asked this question.
Can't see why not. There will be someone at the front blowing smoke up everyone's a*se.
be happy knowing you have a good chance of wan king at his age
Lol...get ear plugs
Join him I mean why not you both so it anyways

Sad you'd think a 14 inch johnson would be junk.
That's correct. Since you're identifying as a woman you can hang around inside the woman's public restroom teaching young girls what it means to be a Trans, you'll be multi culturalizing them, so they'll be more ready to face the world.

Actually that's a very good point. It won't be long before we start hearing about cases where women are attacked in rest rooms by sexual predators who freely entered by claiming to be "psychologically female".
Yes
Well, if your 14 inch penis is just junk, donate that penis at someone. It will sell for the highest bidder. Then, you can be a RICH woman.
The largest penile size is 13 inches. You are either a liar or just making up for the fact that you have a micropenis
Learn to troll. It's not effective trolling if everyone knows it is trolling.

Are you weighing multiple times a day? Are you weighing under the same conditions? Your weight can fluctuate up to 5 pounds in a single day so it is best to weigh at the same time same day and under the same conditions. In the morning is best after using the bathroom and before doing anything else and unclothed.
8 tenths of a pound.
.8 just means that you're close to being 1 pound more
Almost 217, but not quite...

If true then your BMI is 13 and you are so severely underweight you're likely to fall over dead at any moment. Anything under 18.5 is considered underweight.... edit - I tried to look up the BMI for a teen but it requires a birth date, and parents height, (which I made up) but then it didn't give me an actual BMI but instead it put your measurements (with an age I pulled out of my a$$) at a percentile.... (5th percentile) so I used the adult measure instead. If he (she) wants an accurate measure I'm pretty sure it can look it up itself...
"Andrea" might be right If we assume you are an adult, around middle age, or so. If true then using the adult BMI scale you are underweight, possibly already dead and decaying in the grave. If you're an adult anything under 18.5 is considered underweight....unless you are a model or actress. Then, it might be okay.
It's underweight. You have to be around 110 lbs.
Too thin.
too thin
4'9? DAMNNNN DANIEL

Talk to your teacher. If that doesn't help, talk to the principal. If that doesn't help, have your parents go to the school board. Not only does biting hurt, it is a health risk.

Bought this for my son about 2 weeks ago. He has cystic teen acne and blackheads. He has reported that he is having less breakouts and his skin seems "calmer" Not as red and inflamed. We are likely to repurchase this argan life Ultra Nourishing Argan Oil for him.
Try to wean your self off with nicotine substitutes, and ask your friends to be respectful and try not to smoke around you, because the way your smoking now, you're on the fast track to lung cancer, so you have to try your best!! Good luck!!
news flash: the *** of smokers tastes absolutely *terrible*. the *** of non-smokers is really tasty. ALL GIRLS KNOW THIS ALREADY. So the sight of a guy smoking makes a girl .... well, we'll just keep looking for a good guy (who doesn't smoke of course).
"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28, KJV).
change "friends" and quit smoking.
My gf has this pee fetish where she wanted me to drink her pee and I agreed to a full cup for fifty bucks after non stop begging from her. I liked it for some reason and now the only thing i drinnk now days is her urine...I never wanted this...tips to help me stop? She's starting to ask me to eat her poop now too...
Shes a no no gf for you, she dont even care on you, shes only enjoying watching you do what she wants, shes disgusting and doesnt fit for you.(sorry for my word). You are a guy and you should be the dominant in decision. And you shouldnt agree to her to drink her pee, and now starting to ask you to eat her poo. Im feeling sad about you bro, broke up with her shes not good for you.
You typed this whole thing out instead of doing something productive.
im pretty sure thats bad for you as you pee to get bad stuff out . they do say if your drinking pee drink plenty of water so the pee is less bad for you and so its clean.
Good. You are not thirsty... healthy-relationship-dating.com/pissing...
you had me till you said eat poo
Perhaps it is becoming the best performance stuff. I am happy with Prolargent 5x5 Extreme. Product does make you hard and keeps you strong for the long haul. I take this before sex and I stay Energized for the night. Better than anything I have tried, it took 2 days to work, and I do take it on a regular basis.
One of the best in what it's made for in my opinion. I bought it and after taking it for a day or two I saw the effect come straight away. Prolargentsize is great and I feel a lot more powerful in bed, will definitely buy again!
Well, what you need is a woman's thong underwear three sizes too small. That will direct it down & around, so the worst case scenario you will F yourself up the A.? I think you want to show if off more. Maybe you have the makings of a pole dancer!
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme works good and I like how long it last.The results are great I can preform for hours and go multiple time without breaking a sweat or feeling tired it really get the job done this stuff is great.
Whatever way you are comfortable with. There is no one right way of doing it.
Should you walk on the street or should you run? What a question! healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
thats ******* good. id say within average length for fully grown male and above average in girth. im 22 and 5.5 inch long fully erect (they say world avg is 5.1..some say 5.5..chances are you will continue growing past 5.3, tho I stopped at 16) im also 4.5 inch in girth which is avg so ur pretty thick length dont really matter but width does coz the girl feels it more so ur algood
You're definitely within the average range. No worries.
Normal. That is small... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
it's fine for your age
http://www.zmescience.com/medicine/penis...
Just above normal adult size.Girth is way above normal.
No. Losing weight will not increase penis length. It could however make your penis appear larger since it isn't enveloped by belly fat. Also penis size doesn't matter. As long as you are longer than 4.25 inches it doesn't really matter.
Yes. Most lost body fat is deposited directly into the penis causing massive penis gains. The winner of The Biggest Loser ended up having a penis the size of a Blue Whale's.
Nope
You won't exactly gain, you just uncover.
Ok so basically im off college due to study leave so I slept in today I woke up at 1030 and ever since then it feels like my brain is hitting the inside of my head. When I lay down its ok but then when I stand up my head hurts alot I can also hear my heart beat through my ears. I was up last night I had a little cry and fell asleep dont know if it has anything to do with this pain? What is it? How did I get it? And most of all how can I get rid of it.
It might be a migraine. Taking an NSAID like Aleve might help. It's best to avoid Excedrin for Migraine because caffeine can sometimes be a trigger for a migraine and that has caffeine. Try to sleep after taking the Aleve. For me, rubbing peppermint oil, one drop on each temple and forehead (avoid the eyes) and also on the neck helps. I hope you feel better soon. And it would be a good idea to keep a headache diary to find out what your triggers are. Common ones include stress, caffeine, sugar, pickled foods, not enough/too much sleep, and the list goes on. If it continues, a neurologist can prescribe medication to stop the migraine.
Its a migraine. Stay away from electronics and rest a lot.
I get this sometimes with headaches and migraines, just take some panadol :) hope this helps
Very typical of you and your kind, is this the claimed atheist that believes in god parrot that is a complete embarrassment to himself but such an idiot god whore who gets a hard on by saying he is an atheist that believes in god? Figures!
Eww, that's disgusting. You should probably book a doctor's appointment.
halelujah, praise to god. remember, god is everywhere, even in your btthole and around your hemorrhoid.
Prudent to see a general surgeon and get it extracted by cutting open your anal sphincter.
Good thing your phone failed at uploading anything, pathetic troll.
What scares me is that this has the potential to not be a troll...
Poor tweezers of the smell.
Yes,it is.
1) You wouldn't go to jail but she would because you are under the age of consent. 2) It seems like you are not ready for sex yet, so it might cause emotional turmoil and regret if you do it. 3) She sounds really desperate, which is a red flag. Most normal women will move on to someone else if a guy tells them he is not ready for sex. Also most normal women can easily get a guy over 18.
No, this is so gross, don't listen to her she's a pedo. Stay away from her, and stop talking to her. No you're not an adult, you still young to be a father. Yes, your penis will hurt, she's a grown woman and she had sex before, and you still young, it's not normal so stay away from her. Don't forget you can report her any time you want and she'll end up in jail, so please stop talking to her, don't trust her, she'll ruin your life, I'm 23 years old female, and i know this is wrong because I'm an adult.
1) If anyone goes to jail, it will be her. At your age, even if you consent, yes it would be rape. 2) It's normal that you get aroused if someone touches you, even if you don't want them to. It's normal biology at your age. Nothing to be ashamed of. 3) your penis will not hurt, but you might get a disease if she's been with a lot of guys, and you are old enough to get her pregnant. Are you ready to be a father?
your penis will be just fine. your only problem might be if you are not of the age of consent wherever you may live. in that case, she can go to jail for having sex with you.
You might feel like attempting this is right. But maybe it's just the easy thing. I tried to kill myself. I lived and find my self happier living. Life isn't easy but by staying alive we make life manageable for all of us and much better. Death is scary
Don't jump into any hasty or wrong steps. If you are genuine in your approach,please raise a solid question here. List out all your grievances. I am sure that you will get plenty of best solutions from eminent scholars here, to come out of these problems.
You shouldn't do that dear. You can find meaning in love dear. You should seek love, because it's the most important thing in the world, seek to study it, understand it, and live it. You will have a renewed outlook on life, and might even find the kingdom of God, where love abounds.
A friend of mine hanged himself when he was 40. Don Harrell. He had a degree in film from OU...he was a gifted sculptor. Haven't heard a thing from him since.
Please don t. Why do you think your life is lousy? If you are upset with your life then do something about it. Whatever you want to do, whatever makes you happy (other than suicide). If you can t find meaning in your life then make one. I wanted to die, too. I know it sucks but you have to get out of whatever **** you re in. Let s face it, you re going to die anyways and you only have one life, so try to enjoy it or at least endure it. I hope you feel better, you just can t give up.
I would do the same thing if I was an atheist. I don't blame you. The only reason I am alive is because of my belief in God.
Cut the $h*t, you troll. People who actually DO want to do this, do NOT post something like this on a board like this! I'm calling you a liar, you POS!
You are kinda right hell is fuking not real so go kill yourself
I hate my life because everyday I've got to battle with this anxiety. I'm scared of everything. I'm scared to talk to people, scared to socialise, scared to get a job, scared to go out. What's the point of living if I'm going to live fearing everything. That's a waste of life. I don't know what's wrong with me. I think it's social anxiety but that's just something I read on the Internet and it relates to my situation. There is something wrong with me but I just don't know what.
Social Anxiety
Are you uncomfortable with the way you look ? If not then you just have anxiety, and you need to consult a mental health professional.
Nobody ever said that the world is a yummy yummy gum drop with magical rainbow unicorn fårt sprinkles.
You can get help from a psychiatrist. I had the same problems and now I take Xanax and everything is fine.
See a doctor and get professional help. There are meds and talking therapies that can and do help many people.

If you are going to skip school, the least you can do is vomit. Take one cup of warm water with 2 tablespoons of salt mixed in. Or, take one cup of warm water with one tablespoon of mustard mixed in. In either case, you should drink more water after you vomit.

So- I am an 18 year old male and I've been battling with depression for my whole life. It runs within my family and I've been hospitalized in the past. I am also put on anti-depressants and every medication I've tried hasn't improved my mood what so ever. I also seen multiple therapist and nothing seem to help me. So- I would like some advice from people who actually battle with depression like me and can relate with me. Can you tell me what you do to help you deal and cope with depression? Thanks a million times over! - James
Find an outlet. This should be something you enjoy doing that either allows you to take your mind off the depression, or to think it through in a calm and logical manner. For me, my outlet is art. For others, it is yoga, working out, watching movies. It is different for everyone. But finding something that you enjoy to incorporate into your daily routine is very important and as someone who has also struggled with depression I highly recommend it.
This might sound like it won't work, but it does for me. Get an app like iFunny or Reddit or Tumblr or 9GAG or something where there's a lot of comedy and humor. I'm overall happier from seeing so many jokes all the time... it's worked for me and I'm not as depressed as I was as a result
Absolutely it's normal to get random erections at your age. Pretty much everyone who has a penis gets those from puberty until their late teens. You're starting a little early maybe, but there's nothing to worry about. Your penis size is normal too.
Completely normal, youre in a puberty, frequent random erection will actually happen whether you want it or not, theres nothing to worry about it dude, your gear was just trying to say that hes ready, so go for it.
Yes, and welcome to the joys of being a guy. Expect random erections, like on moving vehicles (from the vibrations), from just looking at people, when sitting in class, and more. If you want to hide it, just hold your bag discreetly in front of you or use a book. And yes your penis size is normal. You are growing and will do so unitl your 21, so that means your penis will grow too.
Prolargentsize , that's what I'm talking about. If you need to spice up your love life and improve your perfomance then this is it for you. Effects are absolutely immediate : you will feel the difference from day 1! I will guarantee you that your partner will be pleasently surprised if you put this suplement to a good use. Highly recommended by me! Have a great one.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme "Really Works", it took about an hour to work. Being 60 it has been real hard to get an erection , After that hour it was good to see it worked, I have been looking high and low for something that worked, I was glad to see it worked for 2 days.
It's normal, that's what puberty is. You get random "boners" for no reason. This will probably happen till you get older but don't be worried.
Yeah = though sitting by a girl is hardly RANDOM as 12 year olds are usually pretty randy. Your penis size would be good for a 13 year old so maybe you a bit ahead of things. < M
Elevate with a cold compress. Simple painkillers and stay of the foot till your ready. Wear an easy shoe that won't compromise blood flow and use your other foot for the most weight.
Squeeze your foot into the dress shoes, take a box of painkillers with you, and use a stick or crutches if you can't walk very well. I wouldn't get it set into a cast until after the ceremony
Hehe, gimpy.
just get crutches. And get help going up the stairs..
Thank you, I take it I should avoid my high heels?
No need to be embarrassed. Guys get erections all of the time. And there is no reason to worry about your bulge showing.
This thing works well. I am very satisfied for what its has done to my body. i dont know why some people who tried this male enhancement of huntington labs did not get the result they i get from it. Maybe because they might be doing it wrong. Henceforth all of the negativity about this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product, i have tried and and saw results. Great!
Wear loose-fitting clothing for the next couple of years.

Type 2 diabetes NEVER turns into type 1 diabetes, sir. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition whereby the body's own immune system sets out to destroy the beta cells (islets of Langerhans) ... the insulin-producing cells ... of the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes comes about as the body's cells become resistant to the effects of the insulin that the pancreas produces. This means that more and more insulin would be required to have the same effect, which is to 'transport' glucose, which we get from the breakdown of carbohydrates during the digestive process, into the body's cells where it is used to create energy.
Type 2 can appear to be like Type 1 if a person must take insulin shots. {But the type 2 would live much longer without the additive insulin shots than would a type 1 who was at the point of producing NO insulin. <- death in a few days.} If your pancreas was removed then you would also be fully dependent on insulin shots to live, but no one would call the condition "type 1."
IT DOES NOT. EVER!!! type 1 is caused by damage or disease to the pancreas so that it completely quits working. type 2 is insulin resistance. they are very different diseases with only the sugar factor in common. Type 2 people may become insulin dependent but must continue to take their oral meds because they are always insulin resistant.
Rarely.
There are plenty of girls who, at 14, have not gotten their periods, and that is normal and nothing to worry about. Some girls actually don't get them until they are 18. If you get to be 16 and still haven't gotten yours, mention it to a doctor, until then don't be concerned.
Well 11 is too early first of all. the normal age is around 13 so you are just fine. You can worry if you want to but it isn't going to change anything and probably just cause other problems. You are on schedule.
you shouldn't worry and not all girls get them at the same time
I'm diabetic and believe me, it's not a problem. My best friend come over to watch movies and brings pie and chocolate and Mexican Coca Cola. He always asks me if I want a bite. I can have a bite! Diabetics learn (well, at least I did) what their limits are. They learn to 'own' the disease and to be responsible for their own blood sugar control. After you don't eat sweets for a few weeks, when you taste them they seem VERY sweet, not that good! If he says "Don't eat that stuff around me," well that's different. I've never heard a diabetic say that though.
No, it's fine. Most diabetics don't "crave" sweets and junk foods. He knows how to deal with his illness. However, you keep eating like that, and you could develop Type 2 diabetes yourself!
Your friend is diabetic, not on a master cleanse. This is a condition they've likely lived with for many years. I'm sure they can handle their roommate eating sweets.
You sound like a great roommate. He will probably end up beating you senseless.
No, it's not rude. Diabetics can eat almost whatever they want. It's about portion control and balancing what you eat with exercise and insulin (and oral meds if type 2). There's no reason you need to deprive yourself in your own room; your friend has to learn how to live with his condition in all situations.
You're afraid - AFRAID - that you won't find a wife with massive boobs? God love yeh. One of the less intelligent questions I've seen on here of late.
I think you small minded idiots are going to struggle greatly getting any woman. Big boobs or not. This is the kinda **** that makes girls repulsed by you. We're more than just our bodies. Coming from a woman in a happy relationship who has a mere B cub. Good luck boys!
You're gonna find that it's tough to find a woman, big boobs or not.
Try finding one with breast implants then, that's all I've got.
tbh i want a wife with massive boobs too
You just need to open your eyes or get glasses. Most of the younger women (in these modern times) have big breasts. How big do you want them to be?
Is this really that important? If so, perhaps you could get some counseling to help you overcome what seems an unnatural fear.
so what? marry a flat-chested wench and get her some big, fake boobs.
A lump is a sign of testicular cancer, get it checked out ASAP
"checking my testis" yeah right like a 13 year old boy would be doing that - you were playing with your balls
Probably infected hair follicle or oil gland. Apply antibiotic ointment daily
lumps can be a sign of testicular cancer. go to a doctor asap (i know it's hard to bring up with your parents, but it's extremely important since you might have a serious disease)
you may have testicle cancer show your doctor you need to check it out fast if it is testicle cancer
I can't tell if they're chapped or not, but the corners are super red and it looks rashy.. it super itchy and it burns! I've tried applying multiple things like facemasks, chapstick, vaseline, and even gotten a prescription cream but nothing seems to work!!! Here is a picture of something that looks similar to it, though it's not me. please help http://imgur.com/muFHelY
I suggest you don't put anything on your lips, and stop touching and licking them. I think the redness will go and you will recover.
My friend had something kind of similar to this. Could be eczema.
--->> Tips---> https://tr.im/firstgreencolourlink
Many people get their wisdom teeth out 2 at a time, two on one side the first time and then later the 2 on the other side, so they can at least chew on one side while recovering. Just stick to stuff like yogurt, soft bananas, applesauce and ice cream for a while longer. You can probably handle stuff like Spaghettios, but not anything too hot or with sharp bits like chips.
Take warm milk and calcium pills.
i would go back to the dentist
It's not a good thing, but it's not a bad thing either. People eat at different speeds and that's okay. Although eating too fast can cause indigestion, which hurts a lot.
well people are said to eat less if they eat slowly because the stomach has time to send the "full" message to the brain, if you eat fast and still feel hungry and have a little more that might be bad, if your weight is OK, and you chew your food sufficiently for digestion, then I don't think eating fast is a problem
It is not a good thing to eat too fast. It is one of the most common reasons for over-eating - it takes about 20 minutes for the message that you are full to get from your stomach to your brain.
It is. You will fill up before you feel full and will confuse the signals from the stomach to the brain. It could lead to chronic over eating and obesity. Also, it's rude
Yes it's bad.
No. You have a vagina if you're menstruating. It's actually very common (usually this comes up the first time a girl tries to use a tampon) to have trouble finding the hole, or to think it's too small to be your vagina. As a virgin, the hole isn't wide open because your hymen's still there, but you should be able to fit a finger inside (though maybe not a tampon). The hole is where your blood comes out. You can't mistake it with where your pee comes out - that hole you can't find, so if you find one, it's your vagina. It's basically straight down when you're sitting upright.
A woman could be born without a vagina, but she wouldn't menstruate. If you are menstruating, you have a vagina
if you did not have a vagina you would not be having a period so you obviously have one how else do you think the blood gets out?

Virus do not know age
Anyone can get it and infect others.
Listen man you shouldn't worry about something you have no influence on. No matter if your cock is 9 inches or 3 inches, you're gonna have to live with it! Just remember pornstars are selected for their size and do not sketch a realistic image of the average male size. On average adult men don't grow larger than 5,5 inches (about 13-15cm). The vagina is often no deeper than 14-16 centimeters either, so that makes sense! Especially if you're not 18 yet, stop worrying! I did, and now I have time to worry about other things.
Well its common for guys to worry about their penis size. You can contact me if you wish through my profile and we can discuss anything you want.
Most guys who post on here are worried about penis size, yet most I have read and responded to are in fact sporting mostly above average gear down there, just listen to friends and other guys who make outrageous claims about penis size. You are welcome to email me.
Yes.
Start posting your questions on the Mental Health section, this is Men's Health. You need psychiatric help, and we can't help you with that here.
Yes. How large are you? And now old are you?
yes
eveybody male
Yes, your penis is very big at 6.5 inches with a girth of 5 inches. Bigger than the average.
Larger than average in every measure. That qualifies as a big penis.
yes above average at least
it's average

No. If every time you washed your hands and they bled, would you think this was normal? If your teeth bleed when you brush, it means you have gingivitis, which can lead to tooth decay and tooth loss. You need to brush well, twice a day and floss everyday. Also, see a dentist twice a year for a professional cleaning. Don't be content to have those bleeding gums!
I had the same problem. I got worried so I went to see a dentist. He prescribed some antibiotics and mouthwash, because bleeding gums is a result of gum infection. See a dentist about this problem, the human mouth is filled with lots of bacteria you don't want to worsen your problem. Good luck!
If you want them to stop bleeding then here is what you need to do: <make sure that you have a soft bristled brush. <brush at least once daily. Twice a day is better. <floss daily <go to the dentist every six months and they can tell you if there is something more serious is going on.
Teeth don't bleed. It's your gums that can bleed. Other answers give you the reason.
Yes
they used to until I flossed every day and now use plastic tooth picks to clean better, this strengthens you gums so they won't bleed any more, the tooth picks I buy at the dollar tree store
No, because I get my teeth cleaned twice a year. That keeps gum disease from forming. Your gums are bleeding because they are unhealthy.
Yes It happens to me as well Bcz i have a sensitive gum
She might get pregnant since you didnt use a condom ? The risk of you getting an STI depends if she has an STI to pass on? Suggest you go to a dr or sexual health clinic for tests. However as you are only age 16 depending which country you come from what you two did was illegal -usa sex in most states is only legal at age 18 some states age 17, in Canada and UK its legal at age 16 but in uk not if the older person is a teacher, police officer, scout official or priest. Remember use a condom in sex protects you from a sexual infection.
Just because you have unprotected sex doesn't mean you'll get an STD. The reason that you are encouraged to have protected sex is so that you lower the risk of getting an STD. It's also to prevent pregnancy, which I think should be your biggest concern, unless she's on birth control. If you have contact with her you should ask if she had any STDs when you had sex (you should ask this before you have sex, but well... it's a little late for that)
Get yourself tested by a doctor, walk in clinic or planned parenthood. Get an std full panel test with an hiv test 3 months to the day after it happened. What she did was illegal. Wrong. She's at fault. You're the victim here. If she's pregnant that's between her and the law. I would really talk to someone you trust about this further. Stay away from anyone who's over the legal age until you're older. No good can come from this.
Make a will
well your sir are ******, if she gets pregnant then you get to pay child support, but then again that sounds like statutory rape. please be careful in the future and follow your head not your **** stick.
It's no big deal, condoms suck
You were happy when you were doing it though.
Okay.
You should definitly seek professional help. Ask your parents or guardian if you can see a professional and tell that person what you just posted here. I don't believe it's something you can control with just will alone. It isn't your fault you're thinking these things, you most likely just can't control it. And please, DO NOT commit suicide. This is something that can probably be treated with some medicine, similar to the way your depression is probably being treated. Just hang in there and tell someone that you want professional help. You don't have to tell anyone but the professional what you are feeling/thinking, if that makes you feel any better. Good luck and stay strong ♥️♥️♥️
what were your diets like? I'm serious.....synthetic vitamins on cereals are not healthy, preservatives on them, also not healthy, sugar on them, also not healthy...and many parents just don't have a clue and so are enablers of bad health by allowing for the garbage food and never giving it a thought...when the body is out of balance, the mind follows...and the doctors never ask what they eat, ever!!! and just prescribe drugs...and the poor souls just stay lost, bodies bathed in a chemical soup and they can't figure out a thing
I think going to a therapist could help you sort through these emotions, I understand that feelings can overwhelm people but talking about all this with a neutral person could really benefit you.
Just because your 80, you need to stop living? She has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do as long as it is legal. There was a hundred year old that just set a world record for 100 meter dash for a centurion. Should she not have done that? Age is but a number. Hope this helped. Good Luck!
If she is fit enough at 80 then why not go out on the loose .
What is on the loose?
because people do not need to be penned up in their homes after any particular age
To get to bingo
she's bad to the bone. or her weak digestive system. one or the other.
to get di ck
Because she can.
This sounds like the perfect weight to me. You need to be comfortable in your own skin. If you feel perfect then you are perfect. Don't change yourself or your image for anyone else's opinion. If you're not happy then do something about it, you're the only one who can make positive results for yourself.
The lowest average for her height is 111. So yes, it is considered underweight.
Your underweight for that height, I am 5ft3in and 118lbs and look skinny.
Yes you're underweight
Too thin
You will most likely fall asleep. All of those things 'slow you down'.
High? Yeah, you might get high to death. Don't do it.
you'll get high really fast
It will become a mixture.
You will get DEAD At all.
K so I have kind of an hour glass figure my upper body is pretty skinny but my hips are bigger so I look like an hour glass I don't have a disorder that causes this. My hips are just wider than my top half and it's making not feel good about my figure I'm 5'2 and 117 pounds and I'm 12 and 7 months old and I'm pretty athletic I play tight end in football and shortstop in baseball
Yes. At 12 your legs might be growing. Different bits are going to grow at different speeds and not all at once. Legs are needed to run away from danger, so are early. Chest and shoulders widen much later. About 15+ unless you VERY early puberty. < M
Fun fact, only 8% of women have a real hourglass figure- but around 50% claim to have one.
Yes, you are developing and the teens are called the awkward years for many reasons, one is the awkward way many guys develop- some guys your age are all big feet and arms and legs for example. gradually the body pulls itself together.
Spontaneous abortion of a fertilized egg that didn't implant. You almost got pregnant, but the implantation of the fertilized egg into the uterus failed. You had a "mini miscarriage". It should pass quickly, you don't need to go to the doctor unless it gets very painful, or the bleeding gets very heavy and doesn't stop. This is a common occurrence, but serves as a wake up call that you are indeed a fertile female and able to get pregnant easily. Better use protection next time.
Either implantation bleeding (pregnant) or so things wrong I suggest seeing an OBGYN
Go and see a doctor, we cannot tell without seeing you
I have not only drinking but a substances problem as well. If I quit drinking for a while I must immediately look for a "replacement" usually pills to keep my satisfaction, and when I can't get any pills I get back to the booze. I honestly don't remember the last time I was actually sober.
Too long, didn't read. I think it's fine to be a truck. I mean plenty of truck drivers. And? I don't care. Trucks bother me + I'm not going into detail. So there ya go. Meanwhile some other car would die to be a bridge. Shameless.
I stopped drinking te years ago. Never looked back. Worst drug out there and it's legal!
Nope
No, I don't drink. But I smoke weed tho 😁
No, I drink just water.
No. It is a surprise. Are you asking me or the people sitting behind me. You means what.
Too much soda intake
nope,
If the dentist took the tooth out in pieces, it may be a piece of the tooth that was left behind and is working its way out. It happened to me once.
there shouldn't be any holes in your mouth - go see a dentist
go back to the dentist
go back to the dentist and ask them
tell your dentist
Go to the dentist obviously?!
cant afford it
That's hilarious

You might have clinical depression which is is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Stand in the mirror every day after you get dressed/ready and pump yourself up with how good you look. Hit on yourself in the mirror complementing yourself. And smile more. Seriously it's what I do and it works.

I'd be way wary jumping into a relationship based on physical attributes that fade so quickly. To answer, every guy has his own tastes.
Believe me, if a man has access to your breasts, the LAST thing he is thinking about is the size of your areolas!
that's a turnoff for me
who cares what guys like, it only matters if you like it yourself,all boobs and body types are cute
We want to see them all.
pills do not make it bigger. it will get bigger by finishing puberty all by itself
its fine if you do, just make sure no one sees. and if you're 12, dont worry about size, you're still growing :)
You can still get herpes from him. You will never be safe or protected because there simply isnt anyway to avoid it. Even condoms don t work. He can transmit the virus even when he doesn t have an outbreak. So your options are to risk getting herpes for the rest of your life or find a new boyfriend.
If he takes medication, he doesn't have break outs or hasn't had one for a long time then you're chances of getting it from him are possible but small. There's not a 100 percent and fool proof way to prevent you from getting it, only ways to help reduce your chances of getting it. If he does get a break out you should avoid having intercourse, anal sex and giving him oral sex until the break out has completely gone.
ALWAYS USE condoms - if you wind up marrying him and want children - I don;t know how you will avoid getting herpes
you cant.... unless you want to have herpes.... even if he is not having an outbreak and using a condom and medication he can still give you herpes.
Yes, it is possible for you to grow taller since this occurs until the ages of 18 to 19.
Men stop round 16. Don't expect much.
You think too much. It does not help and does NOT change a thing!
How can we possibly know that? No one on here can know how tall your going to be cuz we know nothing about you.
yes

The average penis size for a 13 year old is approximately 3 inches. Your penis at 5.5 inches is bigger than average and very good.
There was a study done on this, but it really depends on how far you are progressed in puberty but for a 13 year old the average is 4 inches and for 14 (if you're in between 13 and 14) is a little over 4.5 inches
Having a large penis with a wide girth is a blessing for any man who even lived. If someone denies that then he lying. I had an average sized penis but after using prolargentsize, I was able to increase the size and was able to erect it for longer duration . Prolargentsize is a true friend.
The average erect penis size for 13 year old is around 3 inches.
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
Yes very good. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches and you have years to grow.
average size for your age is 4.5-5 inches
It's not revolutionary but ok... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Already above adult average so looking good.

The word diet refers to "the food you eat". So yes, if you want to gain weight, you need to eat food that will make you gain weight. That would be your new "diet".

She can name her babby whatever she likes
No that's a good name.

I prefer the Spanish version...Bastardo. Much more flair☺
I would prefer whoremonger or coxcomb
it's bad and it's wrong
Yes of course it will. Just tell him you are not feeling well and want to go to the Hospital or Doctor..he will give you the 1/2 day. But be sure to bring him a doctor's note if you plan on being out any longer.
Yeah, just tell him that you don't feel very well and that you need to take the rest of the day off. Add that you'll manage to complete your work (depending on what you do) later at home or will not have lunch break tomorrow so that you can do it, he will appreciate the fact that you value your job and will be okay to let you go home.
Make an urgent doctor's appointment and tell your boss sothat he can arrange cover. Should this pain persist go to the emergency department, such pain should not be ignored.
You need aspirin possibly nitro but you need to know your bp, could be heart attack

Right so I'm a thirteen year old girl and I'm already slightly taller than my mom and I'd say she's a pretty average height. My dad is kind of average too, he's about 5'11" or just below 6'. My grandma is quite tall, and my parents think I've gone after her (height wise ) coz they said they were shorter than I am at 13 years. I haven't gotten a growth spurt yet and no periodeither so is it possible for me to be tall like my grandma?
Yes it is possible you inherited it from your family's gene pool. I actually have a cousin who has curly hair yet her parents have straight hair, she got it from my grandma who has incredibly curly hair. So yes, it is possible. :)
Highly unlikely. You'll stop by 15. Or before
There are several countries with legal euthanasia, such as Belgium, Switzerland & a few others, however most do not consider depression a good enough reason to allow it. I know you can be charged around $15,000 for the service in at least one.

its anxiety. same thing happened to me last October. went into the hospital with a heart rate of 154. the whole time I was there it stayed around 125 but never below 100. every time a doctor came in the room my heart sped up again. I had been having these problems for years without getting it checked out. thankfully I have no issues and it was all anxiety. I am taking meds that really help
Have you took a table tilt test? My heart beat was the same. I kept getting lightheaded, palpitations, and even anxiety. Until i found out by a tilt table test i had POTS. Where the blood is not flowing to your heart fast enough which causes your heart to beat fast. The doctors told me to intake salt and water.
YES doctors are right you have NO heart disease its anxiety
So you've had multiple tests and all were completely normal. Doesn't that tell you that you have anxiety???? And you being 'terrified' tells me it's anxiety, since you've had them multiple times and you're perfectly fine, so why would you be terrified when you know you'll be fine?
I have found that eating beef makes my BP and heart rate go up and think it may be due to hormones in the meat. Also, I was having palpitations due to low potassium. I've been better since eating more bananas, potatoes, raisins, V8 and other stuff with potassium.
IF you had heart disease you can bet they would bleeding your bank accounts dry. My MUM was treated for 40 years for heart problems, the final autopsy found NOTHING. Not even indigestion...
No the furthest I've been is an echo..but they test my blood every time I go to the hospital if that counts idk if that's what it's for one time my magnesium was low as well as my potassium it helped a bit when they pumped me full of it but not totally
Try a magnesium supplement and if that doesn't work, get tested for anemia.

I always grab things and rip them. Like at restraunts, I always ruin my straw and napkin. And I always split popsicle sticks into little pieces. Stuff like that. I always chew my pen caps, pull the erasers off pencils and I always rip things before I throw them out. I have ADHD and I'm 15. I know when you are 15, you are supposed to just develop self control and stop being ADHD, or so my mum says, but I can't stop. I don't know why I do it. I think its just because I have to keep myself busy, but could it be OCD since I do it as routine?
First of all, you can't just "stop" being ADHD. It's something that will stay with you for life, it's just your mind (but that doesn't mean it's really a bad thing or anything serious). And secondly, you're right. That sounds more like an ADHD trait than OCD. It sounds like you tear up straws etc because you're sitting still and feel the need to fidget/mess with stuff which is a distinctly ADHD type of behavior. OCD and ADHD can overlap but it doesn't sound like this is the case as long as you don't feel like you NEED to tear up the straws etc, you just tear them up out of boredom/to fidget or mess with something.
Don't think that would be OCD, because from what I've experienced people with OCD can't stand things that aren't perfect. Like if my cousin looks at the table and it is even a little crooked then she has to straighten it , or she will just clean the house to just occupy herself. Anyways I think that its just a habit.
Sure sounds like OCD however there is no age limit for it. Considering I wasn't diagnosed till I was in my late 20's. Never was given any drugs for it. We had no Ritalin or whatever the meds are at that time.
What you describe IS OCD,
Running does not add to height. If your diet is not lacking in essential nutrients or proteins, then your height is determined solely by genetics. As a female however, your growth typically slows and stops around age 18.
Running won't help you grow, no.

Salam You must know that masturbation is ***** in Islam.Only wet dream is halal.Masturbation will deteriorate your health in the long run based on health research especially just like you who do it 3 to 4 times a day.You must stop your bad habit so if you get married your wife will be satisfied and get pregnant
According to your own ideology it is your hand that will get pregnant. You should emulate the perfect behaviour of Mohamed who used to masturbate by using the thighs of six year old Ayesha as the point of friction for his masturbation. You would be better off leaving Islam because as an atheist I can wack one off any time I please.
You masturbate more than average, but it will not keep your wife from getting pregnant.
34 times a day, muhammed had the strength of thirty men and couldn't manage that hats off
Are you stupid? Yes, you are!
Tell them you have been adhering to a strict diet and you are feeling healthier do to it. They don't like it too bad, it's your body.
You can't. It's just plain rude. There is nothing wrong with eating off your diet. Opt for one slice of pizza and a side salad. Or whatever else is healthy she is serving. Tomorrow is another day.
Drink water.
well no one is gonna force you to eat if you just say no your not hungry
I am 14 male. I talk to my self like i am talking to someone else and somtimes i reply telling my self something i did not know before. It like this:"i am hungry. Oh are you? Ya i am. Got any ideas what to eat? Nope, hey do know what time it is? Ya its 1:25. Ok thanks,remember you got to hurry to get to somewhere later. You cant tell me what to do! Yes i can i am you. Ha thats what you think." This is how i talk to my self. i have been told it is "very disturbing" by family members and freinds. I want to know if this is normal or should i get help
Normal
I have an uncle who's a psychologist, actually a child psychologist. (Or he was. He's dead now.) I asked him once if it was unhealthy to talk to myself and he said no, everyone does it (but most people it when they don't think others can hear). What's bad, he said, is if you get into screaming arguments with yourself. Otherwise, no problem, totally normal.
You must be awfully lonely to carry on conversations with yourself. Get a cat or dog and talk to it instead. It won't hurt to tell a dr. about this; he's the only one who can test, diagnose and treat you.

No. 13 is far too young. Wait till you're 16.
Tons of people do it, but think of the consequences that could come of young sex. Also, it depends on how old the person having sex with a 13 year old is.
No. Your body and mind aren't ready. You'll regret it.
Yes go have fun
Yup But I like George Burns' philosophy: When I was 18 I liked 18 year old girls and I don't see why that should change.

Sounds normal. Men's sexual urges usually peak around age 18.
The older you get, the long the refractory period is ( the amount of time it takes to get an erection again and are able to ejaculate again.). Sometimes guys that do it a lot have a hard time when it comes to real sex.
Doesn't sound like anything bad, continue doing what you do dude
Keep enjoying yourself if you like it. Just solo sex, and average guy wants sex daily at least.

So, I'm going into high school this year and I only have 4 months to get bigger. What I mean is a bit more muscle and weight. My mom doesn't wanna let me go to the gym cause she's afraid I'll hurt myself and I don't know what foods to eat to gain weight. My family even says I need to get bigger for high school or else I'm probably gonna get bullied. Any tips on how to get more muscle and gain a bit of weight?
You are just 14 and you will grow naturally.
i think it is ok, but if you plan for being pregnant, and do not eat pill of birth control, wine should be absolutely prohibited. Because it can bring great hurts to the fertilized egg.

Why not just go to a novelty shop and get some fake blood? You don't want to be putting paint in your nose, much less scratch or otherwise damage the blood vessels inside on purpose.
Use ketchup or red paint, because blood is tacky-not to mention gross. If you HAVE to use it for whatever reason, cut your finger or thumb (not too deeply, though). No need to risk breaking your nose or leaving an ugly scar.
You make a thickish goop of sugar and a bit of water and red food coloring. Dried blood turns brown.
smash your nose against the wall or use ketchup

Depends on your situation but what I've been told is 3 weeks no food and maybe a few days to a week without water.
You can go for more than 3 weeks without food but the maximum time you can go without water seems to be around a week, but it will vary with things such as temperature etc.
Three weeks without food, three days without water, three minutes without oxygen. Those are the standard "death" figures, you would start doing serious & possibly irreversible harm rather before then.
Don't do anything stupid. Without anything to eat, 7 hours. Then I die

One week.
Grows fast- so that boys can be able to fully function and reproduce if necessary early. So the penis finishes growing quickly-- between 14 and 15 on average. With girth finishing by 16.
Once your puberty growth is over , the penis also will stop growing. It means cracking of voice, facial, pubic and arm pit hair along with chest hair growth are all linked with the growth of penis. Any way it may not achieve even a centimeter more once you reach the age of 18/19. Be happy with what ou have and enjoy my friend. Regards.
Your penis usually reaches its full length by the ages of 16 to 17.
Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. That's it.
About 5 years = but most growth in middle 3. < M
It stops growing in all the years after it reaches its maximum size.
Ask penis. Only he would know. LOL healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
It *CAN* (Keyword, CAN. Depends on the person) continue growing up till 21 or so, so it depends.

I'm not sure, but I would say the answer is no because you have people's lives in your hands and those people would probably be very upset to learn that their RN is not operating at their full potential and may not have a clear mind. Please update us when you do find out :)
You can but not during work. In your own time.
You can go see a psychologist... that's who you would talk to about this anyway. Psychiatrist manages medication... I see mine once a week to once every 3 months depending on how stable or unstable I am.... Then in addition I have a psychologist who I see each and every week for the l don't know how many years now.... We talk about my feelings, daily issues, frustration, past traumas..... You need a therapist (same thing as a psychologist....).
As you can see, a psychiatrist is not very much help. Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.

you likely need one of the over the counter stool softeners to help. don't worry about the red blood its fresh blood and is likely caused by the straining .
Go to the doctors.
I am super unhealthy. •I mostly eat only junk food •I eat basically all day, more than anyone I know •I sit in one spot all day doing pretty much nothing So why am I classed as underweight? I am 5'3 and weigh 5 stone. (I'm not sure what that is in KG) *I'm not looking for a lecture on how unhealthy my diet is, I'd just like to know why I am skinny despite it*
First, you must find the underlying reason. Is it a metabolic disorder? That can be a common reason. Next, most people's metabolism will change as they get older, unless they take active steps to change it. If you are checked out as being basically healthy by a doctor, that is great. Why? Because overweight and obesity rates are rapidly increasing in modern society. As you develop better eating habits and do at least a minimum amount of exercise, which is crucial, you will be the envy of thousands of people, because you are so slim. If you need convincing, just check some of the questions on Yahoo Answers.
You need to see a doctor to confirm why because you could have a thyroid issue or crohns or so on. The whole genetics thing is false. Yes some people are born with fast metabolisms but that's actually not as common as people think. Eating junk food won't actually always make you gain weight but it will have other damaging effects. You probably have something medically going on with you causing you to be this thin.
5 stone is approximately 31kg...you need to see a doctor, this is really underweight. I'm around 5'3 and I weigh about 7 stone and I'm still underweight. - You have a good metabolism, and if your family's got it, then it's in the genes. It's a good thing. I have a very fast metabolism, too. I can never skip a meal otherwise I'd lose weight. My metabolism is that fast.
Of course the metabolism will play a part. But dude, you're not giving your muscles any medium to grow, no nutrients, no exercise. Eat good foods will whole fat like peanut butter, avocado, olives, nuts and seeds as well as sources of lean protein like turkey, chicken, fish etc don't forget some carbs. As complex carbs are good for most people, if you want to gain weight I would avoid them to a degree to slow your metabolism as you have to digest them down into smaller monosaccharides (glucose) and this uses body energy that you don't want to be using if you want to gain weight. Hope I could help dude
You are skinny because you are young and have a high metabolism and can eat a lot(with little exercise). You can look up foods that can lower your rate of metabolism if you want to.
Fast metabolism. As in your case, skinny does not equal healthy.
Im gonna keep it short and sweet, you have a fast metabolism. You should check out some YouTube videos on how to help.
I used to smoke when I was younger. Luckily, I quit without any problems. Actually, those special pills and gums don't help at all. Everything depends on your power of will. It's pretty hard to smoke the last cigarette and never smoke again, I'd rather say it's almost impossible and not very good. It's better to smoke 1 less cigarette each day, always less and less. And these cigarettes must be light, that helps. Well, you might also have some friends how don't want you to smoke when you're with them. Keep in touch with them, spend as more time with them as possible. That would help.
Whether you are a novice smoker or a chain smoker, quitting smoking can be tough. In fact, with the right game plan tailored by you to your needs, you can get rid of the addiction and manage your cravings. As per your question, you would like to give up smoking, but don't know where to begin. You should create a structured plan. Realize why you want to quit, prepare for success, and carry out your plan with the support of others or medication therapy. Quitting smoking is difficult, but not impossible. Consider which of these would work for you: • Build a quit plan • Behavioural therapy • Nicotine replacement therapy • Medicine
There was a time that I quit trying to quit. I smoked for 30 years and was smoking 100 packs a month on august 11, 1986 on the job at 2:20am,
Try gargling with lemonade to quit smoking. A gulp of lemonade when you feel the craving for a cigarette could boost your self-control and take the edge off of the craving. You can also identify your smoking triggers and eliminate the same. Distract yourself- Do the dishes, turn on the TV, take a shower, or call a friend. The activity doesn’t matter as long as it gets your mind (and your hands) off smoking. Get out of a tempting situation- Where you are or what you’re doing may be triggering the craving. If so, a change of scenery can make all the difference.
In order to quit smoking you really have to want to stop, and be determined to do so. But even then it is difficult. Talk to your doctor about a smoking cessation program that might help you. Tell all your friends and family that you want to quit and you would like their help in doing so. This gives them permission to keep an eye on you and that can help. Think about the amount of money it costs - for some people that can be an incentive.
I haven't had a cigarette in over 6 months. I literally would try to quit a lot. But then I would wake up and the first thing I thought of was "I really want a cig" and I would give in. But then one day I was lying in bed, thought about dying, gave myself an anxiety attack and haven't smoked since lol. It was oddly not as hard as the millions of other times I tried. So I guess until you actually want to quit for a reason, that's when you will succeed.
I understand your pain. Smoking isn't just a thing it kind of feels like a lifestyle, the longer you live it the harder it is to kick. I quit just by deciding one day I'm done and I threw the rest away and quit cold turkey. I started going to the gym and sitting in the sauna and hot tub to sweat it out and started exercising. First day was a total drag but after just 3 days I felt normal and well again and didn't have the desire to return. I also rewarded myself with other things besides cigarettes, or any drugs for that matter. Good luck.
I smoked for 13 years, I quit 2 months ago. I was smoking a pack a day. I did something weird to quit, because no healthy remedies actually helped. I chain smoked like crazy for 3 days. I literally made myself sick of it. I smoked when I didn't need too. Didn't eat much, only smoked. After the 3rd day I was so disgusted by it, I haven't touched a single cigarette in 2 months. The smell makes me sick now. I hate that I ever smoked.
I don't know if it's just my mum doing this, or other parents do this also. But do females in general try to prevent others from wearing socks that they don't like? My mum doesn't seem to like me as much as my other siblings due to me being the 2nd child of the family (2nd child syndrome), and now I have mothers from around the globe excluding me from wearing certain types of socks and toning shoes. I told lies about myself being a pedophile and a violent person online, even though I'm the opposite of those lies.
Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say.... New socks. Two socks. Whose socks? Sue's socks. Who sews whose socks? Sue sews Sue's socks. Who sees who sew whose new socks, sir? You see Sue sew Sue's new socks, sir.
My daughter has some socks that I don't like. They have dead puppies on them. It's from some band or something.
Yes.
Dude ur so lame only real savages don't bleed after getting ****** by horses I also **** lions
That's normal. You're gonna be fine. This happens to me every time I have consensual sex with any animal be it a horse, zebra, elephant, etc.
Time for Doc
Dude, was the horse a considerate lover??
go see a vet
Yes, you are.
go to the hospital
You should have filmed that ****.... @zootube
Why would you do that to a.horse? Wtf?
You are being perfectly normal. Everyone will fill severely upset and depressed if their best friends committed suicide. It will be hard but at some point you will get over it even if it will take long time. I am sorry to hear this.
You are not stupid, but you are stuck in one of the stages of grief. You need to talk to someone about this, possibly the counselor at your school or a pastor of family doctor or a friend you trust. Read about grief and the stages of grief. It can take a while to work through grief and everyone is different.
no you're not stupid it was your best friend if it was my best friend I would feel the same way
Go ahead and get them out now. Your teeth will further shift the more your wisdom come out and push your other teeth.
When they become a problem it's time to get them out. Otherwise, if you are lucky enough to discover that they are growing in a bad way or direction befire they break through the skin then insurance will cover to have them Surgically removed. I was lucky enough to have qualified for this & it was the best way with minimal pain or discomfort.
Try to take them out before the end of 2016. Sooner if they are hurting.
Get them out now. I waited too long and they pushed on my back molars, which are now crooked. You won't regret getting them out.
Give me one example of how Republicans/Conservatives have been deceived by big lie propaganda.
Conservatives are gullible and easily beguiled. They are mentally incapable of separating myth and propaganda from facts and reality.
That's funny coming from the scum sucking pieces of sh*t who intend to vote for hillary and deny that she's done anything wrong. F*ck you and the family whose cess pool you crawled from. You seem to be intimately familiar with birth defects, are you speaking from experience?
Ignorance and obedience to the party! Didn't Trump once say he would run as a republican if he tried to get the presidency? Something about the base being gullible and dumb enough to manipulate into supporting him? SusieQ; the truth hurts huh?
You mean the one where the lowest participation rate in the labor force participation rate is believably part of the lower unemployment rate?!
Maybe you are just sleep deprived. To get up at 4 am, you would need to be asleep by 8pm. Do you do that? If not, do it.---------- Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Speak to your doctor as soon as possible. If you're in a place where you feel any desire to hurt yourself, that's not ok, no matter what motivated you to do it. Things like this can spiral out of control the longer you ignore them. If you're worried about what's going to go on your medical record you could try calling a samaritan line or an anonymous advice line, as they will be probably be able to advise you on what to do. Your mental health needs to be your priority, please don't try and go through this on your own.
Take some drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. Consult a professionally qualified psychiatrist and take proper and regular treatment. This is what you should do in such critical conditions.
Get professional help
What? It's fine to joke about whatever you want. Don't worry about it.
It's OK to joke about anything isn't it? I've seen humour about gays far more than humour about the holocaust??
Nobody said you can't joke, but to joke about people dying shows lack of class
No one I know thinks it's OK to joke about either one.
Wanna hear a holocaust sex joke?
I think its okay to make fun of deviants.
good point
at 5 feet 4 you could gain 10 pounds and still not be fat. 110 is not fat for your height. you are one of those people who thinks they need to be a skeleton and sees fat where there is none
You're not fat, you're mentally ill. The target weight for someone who is 5'4" is 125lbs. Considering you are nowhere near 125lbs, it's clear that you suffer from body dysmorphia, the mental illness that leads to eating disorders. Get some therapy.
Thats not fat. You should probably stop trying to look like the people on tv shows and magazines because their whole bodies are fake.
NO you are not you are, lighter than me, Im 5'3 and 140. Don't be anorexic
I don't think so. Caffeine is still caffeine, no matter how you sweeten it.
Cats want in.
No. Just make it more fattening.
No.
Well above average. For an adult, that's 5.1" according to a study of 15,000 men put out by the British Journal of Medicine last year.
Less than 5% of all men are 7 inches or more. So quite huge. And likely done given your age.
Are you measuring when erect or not? That would probably be above average for a non-erect penis.
It's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
5.1 inches erect if you are American. < M
small if you are afro american
I can find nothing about tamarind reducing high blood pressure. Some studies were done showing that tamarind is helpful in reducing fluorides from the body, and may be helpful in lowering cholesterol (however there are no human trials for this), but nothing about blood pressure. As with most foods, their health benefits rarely extend past their own caloric and mineral value.
tamarind have shown it to be effective in reducing blood pressure and blood cholesterol. The fiber content in tamarind certainly has something to do with the reduction in cholesterol, since it is known to scrap excess LDL cholesterol from the veins and arteries.
NO, if it did it would be used by ALL heart Doctors.
The shaft is the big long hard thing sticking out of your body-- and ends with a "head" at the tip. So generally the shaft is the part between the body and the head. As to measuring, get fully hard (erect) and then put a ruler on the top side of the shaft- facing you when looking down. Push the end of the ruler against the base, to the pubic bone, and measure the distance to the tip. That is your erect length. Measure several times during a week and take the longest measure.
The shaft is the main part of your penis between your body and the glans (head). Please see http://www.circinfo.net/pdfs/GFM_EN_2015... for diagrams explaining the parts of the penis. You measure along the top surface of the erect penis (with any foreskin retracted) using a ruler or, preferably, a soft measuring tape. The ruler should be lightly pressed against your pubic bone and the measurement made to the tip of the glans.
Look at it like this... If you were to cut your entire penis off lay it on a table and measure it from point A to point B... That's the same principle and measuring it while it's attached to you. Point A to point B, it's that simple.
As I grew older I realized that I was no longer good in bed as I used to before and that actually made me sad and this Prolargentsize product can be used by adults of all age groups which has made me feel amazing. I don't only have increased stamina , but I also feel younger.
Ruler
The correct method is from where it connects to the pubic bone, out to the tip of your erection, held horizontal to the floor, not sideways or from underneath.
I feel so dizzy and nauseous, like the room is spinning around and I might be sick. But thinking about food makes me feel sick too. It's been 2 days without food, I was planning 5 but it's been really difficult. I'm doing it to try and clear my skin and release any toxins but it's harder than I thought. Any advice?
I've never heard of water fasting. But it doesn't seem like a good way to rid toxins. Your body is begging for water, it's the most important thing your body gets.
Water fasting won't clear any toxins. That's a silly myth. It will cause your body to struggle to stay alive, which is what you're experiencing.
its nonsense you cant possibly be so clueless BS about toxins and the need for detoxes makes no sense if you have a functioning liver and kidneys your body is doing all the detoxing it will ever need to do - if they arent functioning best seek out a physician health and fitness is achieved through good nutrition, regular activity and good hygiene NOT extreme crash courses of anything
The same way you lose weight anywhere else. Eat right and exercise (cardio). The squats and lunges the other person suggested, will tone and firm your muscles, but will do virtually nothing for fat loss. They will improve the look of your legs after the fat is gone though. But cardio like brisk walking, running, bicycling, swimming, aerobics, etc is what you need to burn fat.
Squats seated leg presses See YouTube videos for more exercises that target those areas. You may find some exercises that you enjoy more.
Running, walking, weight training, and body weight exercises like jumping jacks.
Walking, squats, and lunges.
Okay on Monday I fell on the stairs at school and hit my knee. A bruise formed but so did a bump. I'm scared that it's something bad because my cousin had cancer and a bump formed on his knee, later to be a tumour. He died from it and I'm just scared that it's a tumour and I'll just meet the same fate as him. Can someone tell me if it's normal and I'm just being paranoid or if I should tell someone because it's something bad? Plz answer I'm scared
No parsons is something quite different. You are mildly hysterical and hypochondriac. See a doctor. There's nothing much wrong. Just a bump
It's just a bump from where you fell. It should go away soon.
Injuries often cause an accumulation of fluid causing swelling. It is how our body protects itself while an injury, particularly to a joint, heals. Think of it as a type of natural splint.
Why not deal with acne - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Get bevoline, it completely cleared my bacne in about a day and it also got the acne I had on my face and neck area but that took about two to three days. I still use it from time to time when I get a pimple. I f***ing love it!
Of course, and if they judge you for it then you don't want to be in that sorority anyway

Now, there are special oils in the market for people with diabetes.This will be helpful for diabetics.
A person with diabetes needs to be concerned with the amount of CARBOHYDRATES that they eat per meal and overall per day. Therefore, the FIRST thing to consider is the amount of CARBOHYDRATES the oil might be adding to the food.
Any oil is fine. Oil is a fat and therefore has no carbs.
Olive oil or coconut oil are best for EVERYONE.
Gargle with brake fluid.
You have to be a TROLL or very stupid. Don't know how you would just swallow acid and then get on YA and ask what to do. Anyone with a brain would call poison control or head to the emergency room very quickly if this was true. (Joseph, I love your answer, wish I'd thought of that one.)
Swallow the best you can, then plug your finger into an iPad. The static electricity generated should power your iPad for days or weeks, depending on the amount of battery acid you have swallowed.
Go to the hospital immediately, the acid could poison you or hurt your organs, basically kill you. Drive straight to the Emergency Room or call 911. Do this IMMEDIATELY
Come to yahoo answers why don't you lol
Call 911!!!
Don't care.

Good luck surviving.
Sounds like she has had a mammogram and ultrasound and they have identified an abnormality that has the characteristics of a non cancerous lump but they will do a needle biopsy to be certain it is harmless. I am guessing it is MUCH smaller than 64cm as that is about 25 inches!! add: my appologies. With glasses on I see you wrote 0.64cm (normally expressed as 6.4mm) which is about 1/4 inch. My own tumour was 60mm
Mammogram. Round means the edge is clearly demarcated and more likely separate from normal tissue so not so likely to be spreading. Talk to the doctors. Make sure she does what they recommend. Naturally this is worrying but it could have been very bad. It's not.
When you know for sure she has cancer, then you can panic. Right now, you're just overreacting about nothing. you won't find any reassuring answers on here.
Without more info, it's hard for any of us to know about your mom and her survival rates. Try not to worry too much, you'll more info soon.
Mosquito bites, hives, or go see a doctor maybe?
That's almost certainly a case of hives. Take an antihistamine. There are plenty available without a prescription. If you don't have any at home, ask your pharmacist to help you select one.
Can you put up a pic? Most common things are contact dermatitis allergy( from perfume soap or scented laundry products), hives or scabies. Go to the clinic. Take benedryl in the meantime.
Were you outside today, if they are spreading when you rub them then it may have been a reaction to some sort of plant. Calamine lotion can help with that.
Well, this looks like a job for a Dermatologist. You should get yourself to a dermatologist? How> Visit your Primary Care Physician and speak with her or him about your problem and she or he will refer you to a Dermatologist. Good Luck :)
Yes
You did not post a picture so even if I knew what it was I cannot see it to tell you. Go to a doctor.
See a doctor for an anwser.
Allergic reaction.
You don't, just have patience and let it develop. Will grow rapidly over the next year or so to full adult size, but flaccid size adult average is only 1-4 inches. No one really cares about flaccid size.
Live long - I was having a troubled sex life as I had very poor sex drive and I failed to satisfy my partner. She gifted me these ProlargentSize tablets and this is one of the best gifts she has ever given me, it has solved almost all my problems and made me a true man that I am.
that is average for your age. some peoples' are shorter, some are longer. yours will grow, it just takes time. i remember looking that up at your age. it doesn't work that way. we are stick with how we are born with. just learn how to eventually please a lady properly, and you'll be fine :)

Drinking alcohol in general makes me horny.
No, but alcohol can reduce inhibitions so a guy can get horny easier than if he generally was inhibited around others. But beer just makes me pee a lot.
Yes
Well to be honest it does make me horny, but drinking whisky makes me even hornier.
Consumption of any alcoholic beverage tends to reduce inhibitions and bolster natural desires, like sex.
NO... the alcohol just makes it easier to succumb to your baser instincts and behave like an ***
No its quite the opposite.
It makes me feel sick.

Yes! During the summers my Church would make us go on these camping trips and guys would be 4/5 in a one bed room cabin but my last year (I was a junior in high school) there were more rooms then boys so I shared my room with only one other guy and on the second night of the week long trip I woke up in the middle of the night to roommate flapping away!! I joined in and we jarked off every night together the rest of the week! It was ironic how much porn we watched on our youth group trip! Feel free to ask me anything or leave any comments!
If you have walked in on someone masturbating and it scarred you and you're coming here for comfort don't worry we have all seen some messed up stuff like that you're not alone lol
My best friend me and couple of male friends at age 15 used to jack off together in the woods, later my best male friend and I had full sex in the park one summer it was great. Never did it with him again he met a female and got married age 20, I had gay sex till I met an older married woman at age 23 so we are both bisexual. I'm with a younger male partner for last 15 yrs.
Yep. Walked in on my best friend. He was sitting in a swivel chair and the minute I opened the door he turned right in my direction. There was a mass amount of black porn on his little white boy computer screen. He fell to the floor and I slammed the door. I bust his chops years later over this over a few beers. It ain't no thang
Yes, more than once, this boy a family sit for has done it lots of times. He wants me to watch, so I do, but I never let it go beyond that. It's weird. I don't think I would want someone to watch me.
Nope
Yes, when a friend of mine came to me for a sleep over. We always walk naked in front of each other, it's not big deal. Then he started jerking off in bed so I joined him. We talked about girls we f*cked and it was great.
Teens have their time when physical changes occur, some guys are late and some guy occur as soon as they enter puberty. When i was 15, thats the time i saw physical changes in my body like i become tall, my voice deepens then suddenly back to kidlike voice, you probably a late guy. Theres nothing to worry about it, your just overreacting on yourself. Let nature handle it.
Most guys never have their voice break. Usually just gradually gets lower as you mature. Probably has and you just did not notice the slow change.
your a late bloomer and just give your body time too catch up
I'm a lad and I'd say if a lad hit you then I would hit them there so you protected yourself from further harm
Anything is fair if you are being attack. He deserves whatever you can give him to stop him.
It is fair. Do anything to protect yourself.
All is fair in true love and war.
if a woman is attacked it is "fair" to do anything necessary to survive including shooting him in the face. there are no "cheap shots" when you are fighting for your life
There are entire forums where you can post about your nutbusting fetish, dude. Go there!
if ANYONE is attacked by a man the nuts are fair game.
you have asked this countless times
Why the pecans? Go for the banana.
It is fair.
If she's 18, she is a full adult and can call her doctor and get a doctor appt by yourself.

Really? Have her go to Planned Parenthood or talk to someone at school.
I am not a Christian, but I have seen crucifixes and I agree that the "Jesus on the cross" look is rather pleasant. He is thin yet with very well defined muscles. I too want this "Jesus on the cross" look, not for religious reasons, but simply for aesthetics. Will others who want to be "crossfit" disapprove of my secular reasons for wanting to be crossfit too? Is there a lot of prayer involved? Thank you for your time and consideration.
I do CrossFit and actually it was a Muslim who introduced me to it. A Muslim physician who I work with lost a lot of weight I noticed and when I asked him what he did, he told me he started CrossFit and invited me to try it out at the CrossFit gym he went to. I do CrossFit for myself, not for religious purposes. I'm just trying to get myself a better body, be stronger and overall good health. The Cross in CrossFit is for a belief in fitness whether you're Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Atheist, Agnostic, Druze or anything in between. http://www.crossfitdefined.com/what-is-c... https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2012/03...
I don't think religion has anything to do with working out however I wouldn't recommend doing crossfit. I would recommend actually working out lol. Crossfit is sloppy and does nothing for your body. Try High intensity work outs and lift weights. Try HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training).
Pretty sure you're just trolling, but on the offchance you really have been misled: Crossfit has nothing to do with Christianity.
No, crossfit is Haram. You can get fit by fighting Infidels. That's how Jesus (peace be upon him) got fo fit.
Are you trolling? What does religion have to do with "Crossfit"?
religion has nothing to do with crossfit
Assuming you're serious.... The images of a fit, muscular Jesus is just artist's depictions of what they think he looked like. Also, nobody wants to think of a physically ugly Jesus. The Bible said that Jesus walked everywhere do he didn't need trendy fitness programs or diets. Apparently, the Mediterranean Diet is supposed to be similar to what Jesus ate. I one went to seminar entitled, "What Would Jesus Eat?". I think it might be a book, and worth looking up.
Crossfit has bacon in it so.. I don't think so.
No Muslims
That's disgusting bro
Well its a joke but not a good one, your in front of the food and its disgusting to do it. You should respect the food and the person yoi are with.
actually that's crude and rude and sickening and disgusting. It's not funny at all it's sick, in fact you need to see a psychiatrist. See one soon so this fettish doesn't get to be routine with you. It's not acceptable.
Your sister is right. It is a disgusting thing to do, even if meant as a joke.
You're lucky I'm not your dad, cuz I'd whup your narrow behind!
as long as you dont use the cu mm as a gravy
your Dad is very disappointed that he is raising a perverted scumbag
Healthier
The tortilla, cheese and sour cream would make them higher calorie. The beans would make the protein go up higher. But yours is healthier.
I've been with her for timeeee, so I kno her bodyyy n where she gains weight / where her weight goes. She always had more of a tummy / big boobs with a flatter ***. But she lost a lot of weight & has gained a little back, like 15 lbs but we both have noticed how her ***/thighs have taken most of the weight. Her boobs are small & didn't even go up any. curious how that can happen? Is it just her body changing as she gets older ? She's 23 by the way
The body does change overtime. Maybe she was meant to have an *** all along. When she had a flat *** and big stomach, she was unhealthy . Now she may have put muscle on by 15lbs and she's very healthy.
Take a look at her mother and her dads mom. That's likely how she will be, If they are biologically related. Just how it is. Old age takes over eventually. Lots of men like a full figure. Picking apart her physical self isn't indicative of a healthy relationship. Most long term relationships involve acceptance.
Dumb dumb...females are baby making machines and the hormones that allow this to happen can wreak HAVOC on the shape of a female. You are not giving us any pictures or enough information about her total size, height and weight and any other characteristics...let alone any activity she is up to.
Hello Baby Tiger ^_^ !! I say most are cowards when they insult other users or pick on them or even insensitive topics. The topic may be insulting or just plain idiotic and ignorant. THOSE are the real cowards and those who are looking to piss off someone. The rest, well.... some are actually looking for an answer in here and may be feeling uncomfortable with anyone finding out who they are for asking something so personal to not I suppose. I may not have been here long, but its getting pretty annoying especially with the dumb spammers. I wouldn't say scared just jerks and major trolling. I wish more adults were here to make things more interesting.

Generally the genitals grow rapidly in early puberty, so most boys are fully grown flaccid by 14-15, as well as erect. Average flaccid size depends on overall physical size to some extent, and average is about 1.5 to 4 inches. Certainly flaccid size does fluctuate even within an hour or less. Average erect size is 5.16 inches. Girth will actually increase until about 16 and average is 4.59 inches.
You know when you're fully grown. Does being fully grown include your penis? Yes.
I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pill s, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
By 16/17. I'm 28 and mine is just 2 inches!
Starting to enjoy taking this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product. Gets the job done the right from the first dose. A little strong for me at first so I stared with only half dose for the first couple of days and now I feel wider and longer when aroused . I feel it, so I am happy with it.
Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16.
Prolargentsize is suppose to help your blood flow to a special area of the body and it had passed the test. Re-ordering regularly.
Get a thigh master on ebay. I got mine for $10 and no shipping. It's smaller than the original but works great for toning and firming those pectoral muscles. Here's a lame video to give you an idea. They came out with a knock out version called "Bosom Buddy" just for these kind of exercises! Also my arms look incredible from using this often. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zw2uYZ9_...
Go to the gym
get fit
I'm 14 years old and I'm getting an MRI on my lower leg, just above my ankle, to check for stress fracture. Can someone please tell me what exactly is going to happen? Will I have to go all the way in? I'm claustrophobic. How long is it going to take? What should I bring/wear/do? And I heard something about an open MRI, can I do that? Please help me!
I had one about a year ago. I WAS TERRIFIED!!!! To my utter amazement, it was kinda neat! I actually enjoyed it! Instead of being scary, it was like being all safe and sound in a cozy little safe area! I am very claustrophobic as well, so this truly amazed me. It was fascinating. Nothing like I expected! It's not a tiny tube . . . it's a big, round thing. They are nooooothinnnnnggggg like they were years ago. YOU'LL BE FINE! It'll amaze you too. Honest, they're not scary now, even if you don't like tight places. IT'S NOT A TIGHT PLACE, that's just it! :-) Praying for you right now, dear one! Hugs!
You can probably get it down by tripling your activity, aka exercise, level and eating very very low carb food plan. Some friends on another forum eat only meats, eggs, cheeses, cream and green leafy salads. To me that is a bit radical, but they have done well on that food plan for more than 5 years according to them and kept old demon diabetes at bay and lowering their A1c to 5%
stop eating sugar and breads/chips, and ANY normal nsturopathic physician can help get over it or keep it away if you never got it.....just do a search for one in your zipcode, then check comments on yelp, doctors grades and thumbtack which dies a great job of asking a few questions, to insure to get you an experienced physician in your area of need. best wishes
Thanks guys thats my goal im stop eating anything related to sugar i feel much safer now that its not that hard

It will help you LOSE weight. So will eating fewer calories. Keep track of how much you eat so you are aware of what you're doing. Any sort of exercise that gets your heart rate up and makes you breathe hard will help. Jump rope for 2 minutes. Run up and down stairs. Anything extra will be helpful.
If you're looking for a great boost of energy without getting the jitters or feeling like you're consumed with potentially harming and dangerous chemicals, this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea product is great for you. The energy came in a harmless swoop, and I didn't feel like I was full of harmful chemicals .
Yes. Do 30-60s. Sprint for 30 seconds, then immediately jog/walk for 60. Repeat until you can't. Elevate then drop the heart rate burns fat.
Offcourse. It is a physical exercise. It will help you to loose your weight
yes it will and eating healthy will be a bonus
Weird question. But, when my husband and I were first dating, we had to have this big discussion. He eats much quicker than me. So he would finish up a meal, then try to cuddle with me while I was eating. I had to tell him I really, really don't like to be touched while I'm eating... I thought that was kind of a universal thing? Or am I just weird?
i'd like my future wife to give me a bj while i am sitting at the table and eating a broiled rotissery chicken by my bare hands or having her sitting on mµ lap with me inside while feeding m3 and i have hands free to write on y.a. :) the point in that is that the eating wife or the eating husband is only touched while getting aroused, that is a blessing a married couple should try at home when both talk with each other about it to agree to try it out but otherwise without the arousal it could be (from how i feel about it) annoying to get touched while eating.
That would be annoying. I'm a fast eater too, but I don't annoy my guy while he's poking along eating his food over an hour's time.
I'm with you. There's a time and place for everything. But cuddling my food into my lap and on the floor while I'm eating is neither time nor place.
That's kind of selfish of him, even though he probably wouldn't see it like that. As long as he stopped when you told him you don't like it. That would bug me enormously too but it doesn't matter if it's universal or not, it's the fact that you're not comfortable that matters..
It's not weird, personally I don't mind it. But if you don't like it then he needs to respect that.
It's not everybody, but it's not weird, either. My daughter is the same way.
I growl when ppl get near me when im eating.
Pics or it didn't happen
yeah it would irritate me too anyway, it doesnt matter if its universal or just you you have expressed you dont like it - he's being a douche continuing
Once your puberty has started, nothing. 80 percent of your height is genes. The rest is mostly nutraition but that means FROM BIRTH...you can't just pick up in your teens (and in the west we all have enough fats/proteins to reach full height anyway.)
Eat healthy (not junk food) and get lots of sleep. Calcium and protein are mainly the foods that will help you grow, but sleep is main and key... also exercise...
Good nights, rest eating healthy, and drink a cup a milk everyday to make your bones strong and fit with good number of calcium.
U have not told of ur age , if above 17 , no further chance. If below 17 as per ur genes. No food or medicine works
When you are still a toddler - Vitamins plus plenty of meat and veggies. When you are 20 - Okay, I will not say the word you mentioned.
Get your hands on some growth hormone and you will grow, but possibly not in the way you intend..
It's genetics and biology. food doesn't help in your teens. Nothing does. You either grow or you don't.
Eat balance meal and start jumping rope !
eat veggies and protein. dont drink coffee or smoke
fish, almond, fresh milk, broccoli, any else that have higher calcium.

They already have treatments. My mom took a couple of them. Dementia is merely the brain wearing out. I think they will come up with something better to address this problem though. I saw something on a program about research being done. Keep your fingers crossed. Dementia is pitiful.
Some cases are curable now. For instance, dementia caused by Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) will usually correct itself after the blockage is removed and the fluid levels return to normal
The root cause for such worries and anxieties is illegitimate desire.
My God, I hope so.
To lose your virginity you need to have a penis in your vagina, but inserting something else may seriously injure you
depends on how big it is
No. Only a penis.
It can be normal. But it depends on what your symptoms are. Are you experiencing nausea? Throwing up? Stomach Cramps? what have you eaten in the last 24 hours? Do you have a head cold? A sore throat? My niece has strep right now and that can cause a fever. You need to assess your symptoms to see what is causing your fever. Otherwise, just go to the doctor.
Your probably just sick. Go to doctors.
Go doctors x
I am trying to stop masturbation, because it is a sin, but i have also researched that lack of masturbation can increase risks of prostate cancer... WHAAAT???? I dont want to burn in hell but i dont want cancer and die at 50 or something. That's too young for me :P.. IF YOU are Christian or doctor or both that would really help.
It is not a sin, Jesus never said it was a sin. Paul said many things were a sin, but few people pay attention to that. He was just a preacher who lived way after Jesus did and never met him so his teachings are HIS, not Jesus' teachings.
Yeah well = only because believe this sin rubbish. Who said it was a sin ? = A load of elderly bishops quoting Plato. Hell was pinched from Norse legend anyway, it isn't Christian. < M
Frequent masturbation increases the risk of early prostate cancer, for men under 50. It decreases the risk for men over 50. Based on risk alone, you should start whacking it when you turn 50. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...
Go ahead and masturbate but make sure that you inform your parents each time you do it to avoid going to Hell.
It usually takes about 2 hours
They usually last 1-2 hours.
Make a showing. Everyone knows the living must keep on living. The most important thing is the memory in your heart. Show up for the family and express your love and care, then go about the business you need to in order to keep on living - with very good memories for a lifetime of your friend. God Bless.
Not longer than 1 hour and sometimes a buffett afterwards
You will make it. They last about an hour, you have plenty of time.
Around an hour after all the chatting and hugging.
If you have to leave, you have to leave. It's not about you anyway, so sit in the back. That way, if you have to leave early, you won't disturb anyone.
About an hour.
it should be no longer than an hour
You don't want to get kicked in the balls. Someday, you will accidentally take a blow there, and you'll never do it again. However, it sounds like you are really young, brave, and somewhat naive. Tell one of your friends to kick you there, I'm sure they would be glad too, and you'll remember the uncomfortable feeling for the rest of your life.
Not even sure how that's remotely possible. Unless you've lived in a cave by yourself isolated from society... Every boy has been kicked or hit in his testicles. That's a common thing for all males at multiple times in life. You can't live life and not be hit there from time to time.
Sounds like a fatality
ask to get kicked till your testicle ruptures
extreme pain and possibly death
People think that being religious, in itself, makes a person crazy, because 99 percent of the planet is atheist. Really, religion and being crazy had nothing to do with each other. Unless you're talking about ISIS. Then, there the same.
Yes, if they never try to make friends or socialize or work. But "crazy" is relative. I am still trying to figure out why people with learning disorders are lumped in with people with severe illnesses. Yet, we have the most sick people running things and scams. But being religious and not knowing what is a preacher's influence, other people's manipulation, yourself, & God. They can confuse people and make them jaded, twisted, & crazy. Happy that is not me.
Does being too strong of an atheist make people crazy?
There is such a thing as a religious spirit.It is not normal to be extreme on any point of view or belief. Read The Screwtape Letters by C.S.Lewis who set out to prove there was no God.
No, but being crazy can make a person religious.
KKK West Boro Church ISIS Taliban Al Qaeda Loan Goats going on mass shootings
Extremism about anything can make you crazy. Some religions more crazy than others.
Please consider it from Mental Health point of view and R & S point of view. One should be religious and spiritual. In any case and at the same time, that person should not forget to maintain his mental health in a perfect condition always. Craziness is not in the syllabus here.
Yes i am an Anglican Catholic and those TV evangelists are mad or insane no one rants to me about My beliefs that is why when i was 12 i left the Roman catholic church all the hell fire and damnation just because i had Brown skin El Pope will never go to heaven neither will Pell
Has anyone else ever stood up after laying down for alittle and been completely blind? I have times where I ll just get up from the couch or bed and I go completely blind for max 2 minutes.... Also, if you know the static of a tv with the black and white, I sometimes only see that after getting up. What is wrong with my eyes?
Nothing. It's orthostatic hypotension - all the blood pools in the legs and feet after sitting or laying down for a long time and when you stand up it takes a while for all that blood to recirculate where it needs to go, including the vessels that feed the retinal nerve and that's why you "see" static or seem to not be able to see anything. Move around more often when sitting for long periods (not more than 20 minutes at a time if you can help it); sit on the edge of the bed for a minute after waking, then stand slowly and wait, and then walk.
No you are normal. That happens to everyone. Basically you are rushing to much blood through your head which in turn causes problems with seeing, sometimes even it can cause a mini-stroke where you feel numb all around and fall on the ground without control.
See a doctor. It could be symptoms of bad blood pressure.
Therapy can be provide by a psychologist or a physiotherapist or another trained or certified individuals and they normally deal with the less serious but specific health issues that people experience - depending on their area of expertise. A psychiatrist is a fully trained Doctor who specialises in mental health issues ranging from simple neurosis to more complex psychosis in a person - illnesses where people are struggle to define the social norms that expected for people living in the "normal world".
i'm pretty sure a psychiatrist is someone who has a medical degree, thus they can prescribe you with medication regarding your mental health problems (depression meds, anxiety and panic attack meds, you get the jist?). Whereas a psychotherapist focuses more on your daily things and how to improve them. Like say you're feeling down bc of your job, they'll talk to you and stuff. a psychologist does the same really, but they're more focused on long term circumstances such as the mathematical aspects (seasonal patterns of mood and stuff).
There's more than one type of therapy. A cancer patient can be someone in therapy. They could be seeing a psychologist instead.
Same. Please don't unsettle your mind and get utterly confused like this. This someone and that someone are one and the same idiot. You should not mistake them as gentlemen.
If you are looking for just a temporary fix and need to lose weight for some sort of certain event, try cutting out carbs. Shoot for less than 50 grams of carbs a day. You should drop weight fairly quickly. Be warned, the minute you decide to eat "normal" it all comes back. For long term weight loss, try MyFitnessPal.
Cut off your leg.
Don't its dangerous
these are the best answers ever omg
Well, typically you're told about two weeks or so. But it all depends on a lot of other factors. Such as how well the person had been eating before, and what kind of fat reserves you have. Other health factors can have an impact on how long it takes to starve, those in better health will last longer. And of course, water. You die of dehydration in three or four days.
Depends on their health and weight before they stop eating, and the activity after the stop eating. But I would estimate anywhere between 4-6 weeks. If you stop drinking all fluid and eating then the time would be shorter within 2 weeks.
There's a rule of thumb: Rule of 4s. 4 minutes without air. 4 days without water. 4 weeks without food.
Starvation? WITH water maybe 2 1/2 weeks but they won't be functional after that first week. Without water, 4 days.
in my opinion,we can survive without eating for five days but it also depend upon on our weight, height and our activities.if you have better health.
There's several medications that can be used to treat symptoms, and there's a minimally-invasive surgical procedure that can cure the problem by cutting a tiny line across the outside of the heart using a laser.
I was in a truck wreck in '04 & ended-up having a heart attack. Doc said I have a left blockage that you can see in the EKG but I have never done anything about it.
so Rather then Ask the Doctor, You'll come To Yahoo answers ... Which is pretty stupid Dont you think?
That's what the doctor does next. Did you not listen?
Work on your personality issues first. That will turn people away a lot faster than being overweight will. School is out for the summer now. How about getting dressed up nice and going to church this morning? Go to the youth group Sunday School class at your local Baptist church, and meet some nice people in there. Jesus loves you, and He will help you to be the person He wants you to be, if you ask Him and let Him.
You're so insecure I think the word is and wrong, you don't care about love or emotion or anyone but yourself and you just want someone for their rather than personality which is mean and that's why you'll always be single until you change that
You are not looking for a bf but hot bf ! You know you are not a nice person ! What you expect in life ?
Trying going for a 1/2 hour jog three or four times a week.
Is what normal, the height, the weight your lack of exercise or lack of detail to your post?
it's ok as long as you feel good if your alway tiered ache's and pains you need more calories i would say being a little heavier would be a good thing
U r about 80 lb under weight.
So. I'm only 16. But I'm fat. And I don't want to be. I don't want to look amazing just I want to be normal. I hate my body and I try to change it. I go to the gym when I can. 3-4 times a week. 30 minutes of weights. 15 or so of cardio. Usually I walk. But I constantly eat. When I get home from school I snack and all night long. I can't stop. Any ways to make it so I can?
I'm not an expert at all or anything, but I just want to bring up a possibility as to why you're overeating that others may not- maybe you're overeating because you're stressed or have anxiety. You should go to your family doctor to see if it is anything more serious than just eating too much. If nothing is wrong mentally or physically, then ask the doctor what to do because your doctor knows you better than anyone on here.
When you have that urge, have an apple and two full glasses of water. Eat complete and healthy meals with more vegetables. It's a bad habit that takes time and effort to break. If you were fed on demand as a baby, you likely are quite comfortable eating constantly. We ate on strict schedule, so that's what I do as an adult including no snacks. How you'd transition from permitting yourself to eat with no limits to the opposite is your dilemma.
Run on an elliptical runner for 1 hour a day. Burns fat so fast it'll be hard to gain it!
Drink a protein shake or 2
Make sure you are eating well. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...
Anything under 5 inches
One that is too small for the person you are with. I worked with people from a certain country for quite awhile. To sum it up, the women have small p****** (a little too small because I'm a little above average) and I was told the guys all have very small weenies so it all works out.
Something funny about it, my penis is 6 inches but my big bother is 8 inches, I really don't want my dick in that big hahahah, and I think a penis which is smaller than 3 inches
It is a matter of taste, man. I would say anything less than 4 inches is pretty small. 4 is on the small side. 5-6 is a normal size. 7-8 is big. 9+ is giant.
Anything under 6 inches
It's what I have.
2 inches
a penis that's small, what else
It's like a little piano.
It depends on if you believe in spirits or the after life, or even energy in general. Because sometimes when a strong spirit is near that carries heavy sadness, it can radiate onto you. This can occur with living people as well.
If this is interfering with your daily life, and it sounds like it is, go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
What treatment? It's not like you can grow a pair if you take pills. You don't have any options unless they can do an organ transplant.
I would imagine that if you were born without testicles that your doctor would be on top of the situation. Follow his/her advice. If for some reason you aren't under the care of a doctor, go see one.
Something you need to discuss with your doctor as to options.
see a doctor about that
you got to go to doctor and ask what options there is
the condition is called "undecended testicles" you need to tell your dad to get you surgery to bring the testicles from inside the abdomen into the sack
radiohead has a lot
depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain does not produce sufficient Serotonin--- Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.

BREATHE friend. You are not dying. You are merely having a Panic Attack. Get a paper bag and breathe into it. Have some herbal tea, put on some music, turn the tv and watch a funny show...do anything. There is no need to call 911 and scare your parents.
You are NOT dying. You not panicking so badly that you can't log onto here are you ? call 911 if you want and get the police round. What will they do ?? other than question your parents as to why a 14 year old kid is left home alone ?
No, a panic attack can't kill you. Click on the link below for tips on how to handle your anxiety from a man who has gone through the same thing. When you have a chance, you need to discuss this with your parents, because it can be treated.
Call your doctor. You need to see a therapist to learn to control your anxiety. Stop looking for other causes. The cause is your untreated anxiety. A therapist will treat your anxiety.
Permission granted.
So you posted here first...
No
yes please get help
No, my friend, diabetes mellitus is NOT Down's Syndrome, BUT there is a higher chance of someone suffering with Down's Syndrome going on to develop diabetes. Take a look at some of the following webpages.
no.. diabetes is a condition that deals with the consumption of certain foods, like sugar. Down syndrome is a mental disability that effects learning and other things.
Not conencted in anyway, I have type 2 diabetes which was probablycaysed by bad diet and lack of exercise and the fact I was over 50 when diagnosed
um!!?? NO!! down syndrome is a brain disease diabetes is a pancratic disease
no it's not
Two different things their buddy...
thats what liberals think
no
Call a urologist's office and they will tell you if you have to have a referral or if your insurance covers direct appointments with specialists. some do.
he can give you a prescription for viagra (there IS generic REAL viagra (sildefinal)(spelling?) - might have to get it mailorder, but it much much cheaper than brand name viagra or cialis
check your pressure
cut out watching porn
I think this situation is beyond your power to correct. Eating disorders are difficult to treat, even by experienced health professionals. Many people might think the situation will eventually correct itself, because her body really craves decent nutrition, but the psychological factors involved are very strong too. Bottom line: Please get started with a sympathetic professional. Your sister's behavior is a desperate bid for attention and for help to make things better. Of course you worry about how to pay for all this treatment. You'll have to ask and ask among the various help agencies, but hopefully financial aid will be available.
Her hair will begin to fall out and her body organs will begin to shut down if she does not eat. She needs to be seen by a Md and a psychiatrist. Get her to eat mixed nuts or drink natural icecream malts. The malt will add weight to her as well as the nuts. She could have a stomach ulcer.
Your sister's a total psychopath
ok.. if you were serious you'd be taking her to a doctor,
She seems to suffer from ulcer.However, she need to see a medical doctor for medical checkup
Get her checked for gastrointestinal cancer
Okay I've only had unprotected sex once (it was my first and only time) and it hurt tot much to do it and he was only in for like 5 or 7 seconds at most, before pulling out and that was it. I was tested for herpes, chalmydia ghonorrhea and hiv and hep c and all that jazz..but I'm scared they may have missed something :( i have ocd and anxiety and regret having sex so bad idk if my mind is punishing me for it but I'm scared, i've had pap like checks too, to check for any abnormalies
Always be cautious when having sex because STD tests don't test for every STD. Men can't be tested for HPV, so if you sleep with anyone with a penis, you're putting yourself at risk. STD tests also will come out negative if antibodies to that certain pathogen have not yet developed. HIV tests won't detect the virus, but rather the antibodies that can take 3 months to 10 years to develop. Do you know of your partner's status? Talk to him and ask about his sexual history (and see his test results).
If you are not having unsafe unprotected vaginal or anal sex, or oral sex with a cut lip or gum after tooth extraction then you cant get another STI , assume you were tested for HIV? You have to be sexually mature enough for sex -hence legal at age 18 in most of usa or 16 in Canada & Uk and not a 14 year old child.
If your tests came back negative then you don't have any thing to worry about. If you do decide to have sex again then ask your partner to use condoms, if they don't want to use them they you don't have to have sex with this person.
Its been three years now that I have felt this way. I am sad and cry constantly which messes with my grades. I have never felt accepted and don't have a lot of friends either. Its horrible to spend each day fighting with the pain in my mind. I have been to a doctor about this but the pills he gave me havenot helped me. I just need an honest opinion. Would you go on living if you had no way out of decades of emotional pain? Cause I have been thinking of ending my life.
Nope. I;ve been sunburned for nearly 35 years and NEVER Tan, EVER and I STILL Don't have Melanoma. You are FINE.
You won't get melanoma unless you like literally stood in the sun for a day. That girl was just unlucky
it really depends on your genes. Does you family has a history of it? if they do then you might be more at risk for it.
Realistically 1-3 per day. And even that will hurt you after years. Maybe just a pack on weekends.
As many as you can afford. There is not a maximum and minimum amount. I would also suggest that you should not smoke. I smoked non-filtered cigarettes for 25 years and I have a very hard time from lung capacity meaning lack of ability to go any distance on foot without being out of breath. At 16 I wanted to be like the big boys. What a mistake.
0
Like 2 or 0 2 at the most
You can smoke as many as you would like, realistically it should only be around 5 a day if you are a smoker... I'm a teen too, you shouldn't be smoking at this age, I kicked the habit.
You shouldn't smoke at 16.
None. You can't even smoke until you're 18. But even then, one cigarette a day is just fine.
Per day? Or the whole year he is 16? or in his lifetime? The answer to your question as it is stated is 0 to 1,000,000,000,000..... Without affecting your health..... that would be 0. That's like asking "How much acid can I pour on my hand before it hurts"?
no man smoking is bad brother. Get off of it, at least consider a vape.
I don't think it will burn their face off because you use it under your arms which is sensitive skin. However if they inhale it - it may cause harm. Plus - what you are planning to do is called assault.
No. Inhaling it can cause serious problems; it's meant for normal skin not lung tissue (or eyes).
no deodorant has harsh chemicals that only do good for your under arms. i mean im sure its okay but just avoid doing it LOL
Try it on yourself first to be sure it's ok
No
RADA RADA!
It sounds like you've been watching too many Tumblr posts. Drama time. If you're feeling so anxious about work, then why don't you start looking for a new job? You don't have to quit right away - in fact, you shouldn't quit until you find something else - but maybe the act of applying for other jobs and knowing that you don't have to work there forever will help you calm down. Some people just aren't meant to work with the public. Maybe see if the store has a warehouse/stocking position open.
That certainly sounds a lot like some of the anxiety attacks I've had--I call them anxiety attacks because it's not like a full on panic attack, but it's definitely some sort of attack. You mentioned you're working on getting over social anxiety--perhaps this job a little much for the stage of recovery you're at right now? I mean, cashiering involves a lot of social interaction, and even if you've got sort of a script, people can be unpredictable (and mean), which would certainly be anxiety inducing. Assuming your job isn't genuinely shitty, I might talk to your doctor or therapist. They might have ideas or meds to help you keep it together until you can do it on your own.
Life with variety is enjoyable. Life with monotony is hard.
Could be dehydration, high blood pressure, over working legs during running.
Increase your intake of calcium and magnesium and potassium. Also make sure you are well hydrated. If this doesn't work nothing will.
Sounds like you are not getting enough magnesium in your diet. Try a supplement.
sounds like a blockage
I had no symptoms. I just found out in a complete blood count when my a1c was above normal.
I had no symptoms when I was diagnosed, it was found during other blood tests.
Thirst, excessive urination, losing weight without trying. Sometimes even neuropathy if the disease is present long enough without diagnosis or treatement.
Whole body: excessive hunger, increased thirst, or fatigue Weight: weight gain or weight loss Also common: frequent urination, blurred vision, or poor wound healing I googled it for you
I know I have anxiety really bad . But also I have frustration problems I don't seem to Kno what it is . I get irritated easily and very frustrated. I don't know how to handle situations like an argument with my girlfriend for example. When I get frustrated I have anxiety attack & cry then bang my head off the wall over n over Bcus I dnt Kno why I can't handle watever my situation is . I hit my self slapping my forehead over n over . Then I get sad n depressed for a few hours. Feeling hopeless n I dnt want to do anything but lay there curled in a ball crying .

We would suggest getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
Hey, there's nothing wrong with you. It's alright to feel. I think there's something wrong with the people who don't. I don't think you should take it out on yourself. You could try something like meditating, or boxing. Something physical to help release the emotional.
Tell a dr how you feel. There are good meds for anxiety. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
you need to learn how to self regulate. put things in perspective. when something causes you anxiety, quietly leave the situation and explain you need to be on your own. when alone, put it all into perspective, put the issue away and then return. you will get good at this and be able to do it quickly.
These symptoms correlate w/ low serotonin which may involve insufficient Magnesium, vitamin D &or B6. An impairment in B6 metabolism may require supplemental Pyridoxal phosphate. http://www.progressivehealth.com/low-serotonin-symptoms.htm http://www.medindia.net/news/low-serotonin-level-makes-adolescents-to-engage-in-self-harming-behaviours-33835-1.htm http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25713056 "Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603926 "Low serum concentrations of vitamin B6 and iron are related to panic attack" http://www.mgwater.com/conseq.shtml "Mg deficiency intensifies adverse reactions to stress" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198864/ "Magnesium deficiency induces anxiety" https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolutionary-psychiatry/201106/magnesium-and-the-brain-the-original-chill-pill Low Serotonin & aggression https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/09/110915102917.htm
Go to counselling
If you're lucky, your friend receives medical treatment immediately and no permanent damage is done to him. If you're not lucky, your friend is blind in that eye for life and has permanent facial scarring. In either case, expect to be detained and questioned by the police.
If you should do it on yourself first, and see if this prank will be well worth it.... wouldn't hurt to practice :D
You'll probably cause severe damage to his eye and you'll probably be liable for the injury and be sued in court.
Not a wise thing to do , He will go blind and you will go to prison for 10 years
never do some thing like this and so stupid. do you want to make him blind and do damage to his or her eyes for the rest of the life. you will never forgive u self looks like you need some medical help if u are thinking things like this.
nothing should happen, after all, it's just a prank bro.
It's idiots like you in the world that make me want to just stay inside all the time.
An eye for an eye.
You won't have any friends
It is a stupid idea. However, the consequences will not be nearly as bad as the other people who answered this question think.
You should deal with such fictitious issues firmly, efficiently and effectively. There is no other go. Be smart.

Animals do not drink any water, but they drink water humans would not. I guess it has been a long time since humans did not provide themselves with fresh.
Some animals have adapted over time to be able to drink bad water while humans have not adapted to have that ability
The bodies of animals are used to drinking water humans would consider dirty. They're bodies have developed resistance against microorganisms found in unfiltered water. But even animals have restrictions as they can't drink saltwater(land animals)
I have no idea. My cat drinks out of the birdbath all the time. She never really uses her water bowl, except to "drown" her toy mice. Birdbaths have bird poop in them, dirt and slime. And yet she's the picture of health. She also drinks out of the toilets. But she waits for me to flush them, thankfully. Yum yum! Great water.
animals can get sick from bad water too, their sniffing ability far exceeds ours and they tend to avoid bad H2O
yes
High chances you'll grow to 6'4 6'5 maximum
Your height is determined by your genes. By 17, most males are at our near their adult height but certainly not all. The only way to know if you can still grow is to have x-rays of your growth plates. If your growth plates are open, you can still grow; if they have fused then you are done growing.
Highly unlikely at your age.
Around 120
Around 125 lbs on average, but if you are a small frame up to 10 lbs lighter and a large frame or an athlete 10 lbs heavier
According to the Mayo Clinic, a healthy BMI (body mass index) is between 18.5 and 24.9. Using the BMI formula, a healthy weight in pounds for someone who is 5'5" would be between 109 and 146.
Although the ideal weight for 5'5 is seen as 115-120, it's different for a lot. It all depends on your frame.
They hate themselves. That is why they can never stop telling us how great it is. The psychology of this trash is very simplistic. Read their comments and see.
Transphobe... how does it feel knowing your opinions probably have zero affect on the lives of transgender people in society ?
PS fluid and brake fluid are both hydroscopic. Also PS fluid will take paint off a car, I would hate to think what it would do to the bluing on your gun. I would use regular motor oil before I would use a hydraulic fluid.
There are some recipes like that, but automatic transmission fluid is cheaper than power steer fluid. Power to the people.

I recently noticed that I have some barely noticeable stretch-marks on my outer thighs. I am 14, weigh about 108 pounds and am 5'1 1/2. I haven't grown a lot in height and I have gained only a 1 or 2 pounds over the course of the last year, but nothing significant. I haven't measured myself in awhile, so I don't think I've gotten taller, but I'm not sure. What do you think could have caused this?
Stretch marks occur when skin is stretched a lot over a short period of time, so either your thighs probably got bigger relatively quickly, or you had a growth spurt. Stretch marks are very common in areas with a lot of fat. Women frequently get them around the stomach during pregnancy. They are also common on the thighs, breasts, and arms. Cocoa butter is good for preventing them when used daily.
The stretch marks are common and normal. They happen when some area of your body gets bigger faster than the skin can stretch. Lots of girls and women have stretch marks.
I think all women have stretch marks on their thighs. Maybe talk to your mom or big sister about it. I don't know if this is true but I've heard that to minimize stretch marks you should moisturize your skin daily and drink plenty of water.
So? What is your point? I don't hear Conservatives as a group denying rights to transgendered people. I hear them opposing laws that allow men to go into the little girl's room or high school showers because they "feel" feminine that day. You think the pervs will not lie to get in and then sue you if you oppose them being there? People get fired for not letting someone with a dog into the restaurant when they know it is not a service dog but the owner of the untrained mutt insists it is.
Wrong Sub Orbital Ridge (Brow) It's why the Mona Lisa is so damn ugly Leonardo Da Vinci was gay (he was even arrested for it) The Mona Lisa is Leonardo, as a woman. It is ugly because men have a sub orbital ridge and women do not. By the way, I AM gay and I HAVE had sex with a man who became a woman. And TRUST ME, you can tell the difference. The hands, the arms, the hips, and the face and cheekbones make it REALLY obvious. And this person was a very slender, beautiful person to begin with. But you can tell instantly when you see them naked.
I am obviously more picky than you seem to be. You seem to keep making assumptions that you lack any facts to support. For instance you are making the assumption in this question that all transgenders are post op or intend to get surgery to create an illusion that they are real women.
No, YOU can't tell the difference. And trying to accuse strangers of the exact perversions that occupy you is just sad.
Yes. It was one of those inside-out penises. It just doesn't feel the same. And it's kinda weird f*cking a reverse penis. Ewwwww.
BS, they still look like drag queens. Bruce still looks like Bruce only with expensive clothes on. The voice as well.
That's why I don't sleep around. Get it?
Your starting a habit that may grow out of control one day. I know their great and I love them that is why when my prescription ran out I don't take them anymore and try not to think about it. You are especially at risk if addiction runs in your family, addiction to anything including alcohol.
can it? yea, will it? probably not. For those pills the acetaminophen is more harmful than the opiate. But pain pills can progress to Heroin since its stronger and cheaper
drugs are the leading cause of unnatural death.
you dumb this is gonna be an addiction
No it's not normal to feel like peeing that often. You are OVER hydrated from the sounds of it. Your body is trying to clear it out as soon as you put it in basically. The color isn't a problem though.
Yes, this is completely normal. Having clear pee shows that you are properly hydrated.
Clear pee is good - but wanting to do it so often is NOT! Go see your doctor - ASAP !
It means your hydrated. Kep drinking water
lol yeah it should be clear
lift for scheduled time, and when that scheduled time is just baby work to you then schedule it longer or more often. dont jump into anything that concerns your body or physical health
Schedule time. Do it easy and you'll do fine :)

This is a stupid question, for which I apologize. I'm in recovery for anorexia and trying to differentiate what people find aesthetically appealing as opposed to the ideal that I hold. Right now I consider myself to be very overweight and I think that people would find my body to be disgusting, and I would just like an honest opinion so I can just know. I'm 5'8" and a little, 125 lbs, and I have a 26 inch waist (US size 4) and probably too big boobs (34D). My arms are muscular as are my calves, but this is a part that I'm particularly unsure about. Thank you, and I apologize for the specificity and oddness of the question.
Beauty is defined by the user. No such thing as big arms because I find arms to be attractive. Your thighs might be too small if they are the size of your arms. You are taller than me, I'm only 5'4 and 100 Ibs, not on purpose but it is very hard for me to gain weight considering the fact that I have three kids already. Don't let society decide what you think about yourself because I can already tell you that you have a beautiful personality already :)
Wouldn't it be great to look the mirror without that critical voice telling you that you look bad? That voice isn't real. Look in the mirror happily and proudly. Smile. Declare yourself to be perfect and gorgeous. That's what I do. Make a song list pertaining to accepting yourself. Listen to that instead of attending to the voice which is bringing you down. How people perceive you is dependent upon your own projection of what is going in in your head. If you radiate self love, it shows. Conversely, loathing yourself shows, too. If you have a treatment plan, follow it. Continue speaking to your psychiatrist. Otherwise, speak to your school counselor.
when you had anorexia the demon aka Ana or Ed (a real demonic entity) brainwashed you to think normal weight is massive - you are still brainwashed - hypnotherapy could get rid of the disordered thoughts anorexia left you with https://fightingthedemonanorexia.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/the-reason-why-recovery-from-anorexia-is-so-elusive/
Try only smoking after you accomplish all of your daily goals. That way she sees that you are still being productive when smoking. Productivity seems to be the main concern for most people. I've been smoking for about 9 years and I've found that it's better if I smoke as a reward rather than whenever I feel like it. I mean it's perfectly healthy if you are smart about it. If you do it too much though, especially indica strains, you'll lose the effects it gives you and youll cease to be productive at anything.
Make her a fat blunt, that'll make her feel better. Um, seriously though, you should try just talking to her and explaining that you're not an addict, you're not on crack or meth and it's only a bit of weed, plenty of people actually get is prescribed to them these days to help various medical conditions and stuff so aside from the obvious bad points of smoking (cancer and ****), there's really not much to worry about.
You should offer her some. It will help her relax. Plus, sharing your goodies is always the right thing to do. Don't be greedy, share the love.
You must be high right now to think that you'd get a good answer to that question on yahoo.
Try to spell better so she doesn't think it's making you stupid.
Stop doing that until it is time to move out on your own. This stuff is simple not rocket science.
Let her know you have goals to aspire to. Don't let weed be your identity
You Offer Her Some.
Yes. The bacteria your intestinal tract can handle with no problem is not that way in the vagina, and if it makes its way to the urethra, you can get a bladder infection. Nothing wrong with fingering you there, but that finger cannot return to the genital area afterward.
Hi there, Yes. If bacteria from the anus is spread to the vagina, then it can cause cystitis, which is a urinary tract infection. It's conceivable that this could spread to the bladder. If you notice any symptoms such as pain when going to the toilet or needing to go more often then you should see a doctor. Hope that helps.
Yes, it can definitely cause a urinary tract infection or a bladder infection, especially if you were not clean prior to your boyfriend sticking his finger in your back hole. You should always wash your hands between holes so that you avoid cross contamination.
No. It can however cause infection in vagina. This can be of fungal or bacteria type. You must teach him that a finger cannot move from butts to vagina. He must mature to avoid any infection in future. Bladder is out of question. Dont worry.
Ever hear of safe sex? This is about as far from it as you can get.
YES! Don't let him do that again!
Yes, of course. And that was a STUPID thing for him to do.
yo answering my q would b v helpful thx xxooo
No. It's terrible to do abortion. From the time that an egg is fertilized by sperm it's a living thing! Our lives are not from the cradle to the grave y'all. As for sex change, it's also awful. No matter how many body parts you change, you're still what you were to begin with, it's genetic. Obama is a fool who has ruined a lot of stuff in the USA. Can't wait for him to be out of office. I don't think we're in good hands for the next 4-8 yrs. though......
F*ck Obama and every other politician in the last 100 years. "Every 4 to 8 years" people continue to put way too much trust and faith in wolves. Silly.
Nope. Obama, in the last few months of his presidency, is desperate to leave the largest possible legacy that will be difficult for a Republican President to overturn. But this one will be easy for a Republican President to overturn, IF the next president is a Republican.
I am in favor of a sex change for Obama, although in its case castration is probably redundant.
Yeah I agree. Anyone who doesnt has probably dropped out of high school and mooches off their rich parents for weed money.
and Obama says eat white babies and offer their parents as a sacrifice to Lucifer. Is this a fox news rip off
I dont agree with anything Obama does.

Diavit Plus is simply a multivitamin and other products that are meant to help with some of the 'problems' that MAY occur with someone that has diabetes. There should be no real problem with anyone taking it ... assuming, of course, that you're not intending to take more than the recommended doses. Read the following webpage to see what the constituents of Diavit Plus are, and what they're supposed to help.
Well as it requires a prescription, your doctor likely would not prescribe it for a non diabetic as there are plenty of other vitamins available. You should never take medicine that has not been prescribed to you.
Can you? Yes. But should you? Probably not.
Yep. See for yourself... http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vege... You'll have to scroll down a little to see the info. They started putting a bunch of site hoarding stuff at the top of the page.
kind of they are but i hate mushrooms as hell
yea
Yes they are. :)
Well you haven't mentioned how many calories you're eating, how long you're exercising for and how many calories you're burning? Remember you have to fuel your body (your body burns calories just by functioning) and you have to fuel your workouts as well so keep that in mind if you're being over restrictive with your intake.
Yes exercise can cause you to be sleepy, hungry, tired, hyper and many more but it pays off :)
Your body exercises and it needs fuel to do so. Food is that fuel.
I meant I AM craving junk food
The average penis size of a 14 year old is 4 inches. So your penis at 7 inches is a lot bigger than average. It is not too big though and actually it's a wonderful size.
You are not outrageously large, so don't make a big deal out of 7 inches. I was that at 14, grew to 8 at 20, I was 5'11 at 14, and grew to 6'2 at 20. I have enjoyed sex with young women since 18, so enjoy your reputation your are gaining, 'cause curiosity garners sexual interest.
I would accept the rumors. At 14 it won't do your reputation any harm, and you should have queue of 15 year old girls curious to try it. < M
I was skeptical before I bough t Prolargentsize, and I was surprised how good it was. I took two pill s , later it helpe d me to have a harder erection and the intercourse lasted a lot longer than normal condtion.
7 inches is huge, of course but not a deal breaker on sex, you'll just have to be careful on penetrating since the average vagina cannot handle your full length.
Well, it is what it is... clearly that's big. Whether or not you let it get to you, is your choice. Make a joke about it, or ignore the taunts, then they'll find someone else to bother.
It's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
I was planning to take a treatment as I had very poor sex drive and sometimes absolutely no desire to have sex because of my poor performance. When I came across this Prolargentsize product which also happened to be much cheaper than the actual treatment I planned to take, I decided to give it a try and the result if you ask me is commendable
There really isn't such a thing as too big. If what you say is true then you have a really nice big dick.
go cold-turkey with the porn. It's an addiction JUST LIKE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. Stop it. The addiction to porn is killing your social brain cells JUST LIKE drugs and alcohol did. You'll ALWAYS be single as long as you watch porn. always. always.
no need to kill yourself join a local club where you can meet lots of girls
Get out and try socializing and away from the porn. That should help.
Maybe you need to relax more and meet ppl. < M
no, instead you could enjoy your situation, because you spared the orrible torture and humiliation that women like to do to men, ruining their life... :)
Obviously.
You don't have to take anything off. Just pull it down, as you would if you were using the toilet or putting a pad in your underwear.
Just pull them down like when using the toilet.
yes all of them
what ever is easier for you, personally I never wear panties
no, because i am a man :)
The article says once inflamed it must be removed immediately and cannot be returned to its normal state.
If it rupture yes, but then you got a whole lot of other problems!
Tell it to leave
no it can't and it will get worse and rupture and you'll get really sick and die
No.
Stop whacking off so vigorously. Seriously. And give it about a week's rest.
Definitely go in to see a healthcare provider. I can't think of anything you can do alone to improve this. Stay well hydrated. This could potentially be an infection. If you have no insurance, you could still be examined by an ER doctor. Ready yourself for a potential rectal exam.
Try the ER then...they don't care if you don't have insurance.
see a doctor asap
I would definitely mention it to your oncologist. You did so good the first time around, you don't want it to come back again full force and hard to treat. Go speak to him...
Black stool can be from your diet. If you have bleeding, go to a doctor.
Definately worth a follow up visit to be sure.
Your mother needs to be beat up side of the head with a 2×4. If she was that irresponsible not to have you circumcised as a baby, she should have at least taught you proper hygiene. You should have been pulling your foreskin back every damn day of your life and washing under there with warm soapy water. I cannot imagine that horrendous odor coming from your filthy penis at this moment. And where is your dad? He's as much an idiot in this as your mom. If not more so. He's the one that should know more about that anyway.
In your case no, as crazy little British boys who belong in mental hospitals do not get that much action anyway. Hopefully it will get infected and fall off so you can't have any retarded kids.
eeww
it happened to me and yes it's embarrassing. don't worry, I'm pretty sure no one will bother you about it. if they do, tell them that it's a normal thing for girls and every girl goes through this and tell them to find something better to do than make fun of something you can't control. to prevent leaking from happening, wear a longer pad during your heavy flows or if you wear tampons, change regularly. keep a pair of extra undergarments and shorts in your locker/bag too :)
It's happened to me take. Extra pads / tampons underwear change often
Probably happened to every girl in your school, or will happen.
Happens to LOTS of people. You are anything but the first person to have this happen to you.
has happened to every girl/woman in history , don't worry about it
Take an extra care of it.
well i just turned 50 last year and my motivation is the fact that i made it this far and i also have an amazing 11 year old son
Make a list of things you want to accomplish during the rest of your life, and prioritize them- and start doing them. If you always wanted to do something specific-- then make every effort to do that. Doing what you dreamed about all your life gives a sense of satisfaction.
Work on that waistline.
just make sure you earn lots of money otherwise retirement will really suck .
im 13 and I know how you feel. I feel like I wasted my life... All I did during summers was go on stupid vacation to Europe....... LIKE WTF I WANT TO RANK UP IN CALL OF DUTY AND LEAGUE OF LEGENDS!!! STUPID MOM AND DAD ALWAYS TAKING ME TO VACATION PLACES!!!
no, why bother
I feel like there are things only people studying specifically SA know about it and she is a specialist in anxiety according to her. But she says things like anxiety is anxiety and its all treated the same, and also wants me to take medication and I cant tell if I need to find someone that understands SA specifically more or if shes right and its treated the same way as general anxiety.
I think social anxiety often responds well to therapy. Meds might help you feel less anxious, but they won't address the lingering doubt you have about your social fitness. The reality is that a lot of social anxiety is treated when we put ourselves in social situations, recognize that people aren't really judging us, and accepting the fact that part of the way we learn social skills is to make mistakes along the way.
Psychiatrists prescribe the appropriate medication for mental illness. There are specific medications for anxiety, which is treated the same in terms of drugs. A psychologist can help you talk about and alleviate your specific anxiety symptoms through talk therapy.
It could be, or it could be that it is coming soon. Brown blood is old blood, and first periods often look like that and are very light. I'd say wear a pad and if it continues on then it's your period, just that one spot then you're period is coming soon.
Congratulations your becoming a woman!! Its called spotting. When its brown its old blood and nothing to worry about. I would get your Maxipads soon.
probably yes, watch out if gets heavier. wear a pad
i would ask your mom as she got those at one time
take a shower and use librese afterward, and rest
I can get horny from watching porn or reading a sexy book or something, but if I try to masturbate it is either really hard for me to get pleasure or I don't get it at all. Why is this happening? Is there something I can do to change it? (Also, I've never orgasmed. Ever.Not while masturbating, during sex, never.)
Let the pet pooch lick your clitoris.

Sexual assault is a very traumatic thing to happen to someone so it's alright that you're still not over it in 2 years. Maybe talk to someone you trust, your parents, family members
the effects of sexual assault or abuse can actually worsen as you grow older, into adulthood. are you getting help for it from a counsellor who specialises in sexual assault? if not, you really should. they can help you "get over it", in other words overcome the effects of it. all the best <3
It is something very serious and extremely traumatic. You may not be over it but eventually it will take up less and less time in your thoughts. Be gentle with yourself.
See a counselor, therpaist.
You suffered emotional trauma.
Go kill someone
Nope
Would never date someone with butt implants. They look worse then fake breasts. Otherwise, prefer a healthy body.
I prefer medium-small. In a pinch I'd settle for mount Rushmore.
Well, I am more of a shoulders kinda girl, so no. But I'm sure others will.
YES, ITS HAS A MAJOR IMPACT. I LIKE BLACK WOMEN AND THEIR BUTTS MUST BE. 1. shaved and no hairy. OR ONLY A LITTLE HAIR ALLOWED 2. no butt odor or sweaty. the black must be cleaned 3. I like MEDIUM OR BUTT BUTT SIZES. solid, firm, and no flabby or weak 4. DONT CARE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CELLULITE ON THEIR BUTT as 5. I LIKE DARK BLACK WOMEN butts types. the darker skin tones 6. THE BLACK women must know how to booty dance and twerk well
Yeah I love a broad with a fatass
Uh...nope.
yes, I like big butt types only
im already married and we both have adorable butts
no impact whatsoever
Probably 13 or 14. Because that's about the only age that boys try to claim something bizarre. Any male that has a 7.5 inch penis doesn't need to tell anybody. Because he just wouldn't care to. He would realize how unimportant it would be.

Getting kicked in the balls is TERRIBLE! You hear girls say that getting hit in the boob is worse, but it seriously isn't. When you get kicked hard in the balls you can throw up, be paralysed in that area, and be infertile for the rest of your life. It be BAD! The pain can also spread to other parts of the body, stomach included. Your friend has my condolences.
Because the brain can only guess where the pain is coming from. It works on a near enuff is good enuff system
It's called "referred pain". Pain in internal organs is often referred to sites distant from them. Kidney problems will make your back hurt, too.
I just busted a fart that you would seriously not eve believe.
No it just gives you lung cancer. Sooner or later.
No. It actually stops their growth.
never heard of that
No.
it kills you
Yes,it will kill you.
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I can't get rid of mine overnight so it might not work for you. You can try though and see what happens when you wake up. I don't know how either since I never really tried to get rid of them overnight
If it's not a whitehead it is literally impossible to get rid of it overnight. If you're a girl consider concealing it with a little make up.
If it is a whitehead you can put hot water on it until it is very soft and then squeeze on both sides to pop it and get all the pus out. Then don't touch it for a couple hours and it should be all cleaned up.
It doesn't work for everyone, but have you tried using ice? Put an ice cube into a cloth. Rest it on the affected area and for a few seconds. take it off and wait a few minutes before repeating.
Put ice in a towel and hold it there for a while... It should help make is smaller or get rid of it
Tooth paste over night will dry it up
that's not going to happen - if you had used Clearasil 2 weeks ago, it would be long gone by now
You cannot.

All I can say is if you are really going to do it, use a rope, high building, or pills, but don't use a firearm. There are more botched Suicides with firearms than any other way, and you think you have problems now, try living as a vegetable the rest of your life.
dude dont what are u thinking if u want to talk email me at ischartaylor@yahoo.com I used to think it was a good idea ive tried 5 times until i talked to someone thru email and were best friends today. Its not worth it music is my passion and now i am an upcoming artist. Dont do it email me
It is actually illegal to answer your question. Call a suicide hotline instead.
It is a felony to assist someone with suicide.
cool2002, you're probably being sarcastic, but that's actually what it feels like to me. This whole world just feels wrong sometimes, like I'm meant to escape or find a way out. Additionally, I once had an experience where I read a sign for a story one day, took note of what it said, and the next day the sign looked almost exactly the same but with a different name. It freaked me out, even though I've been trying to convince myself that I just read it wrong the first time.
This sounds like a type of schizophrenia or at least paranoia. You really do need help for this, and will be thinking more clearly if you get some help. Isn't there someone you trust- a mother or aunt or grandma. This won't get better until you talk to a doctor or therapist and get some help- probably meds, and maybe therapy too.
Your half right. The current gov't IS trying to control you/us. So vote for Trump; he will clean up our extremely corrupt gov't.---- Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
it sounds to me like when you say that people around you do not seem real, it sounds to me like you are seeing doppelgangers of people that you know and other people as well instead of the original version's of those people that you saw previously. they actually do have top secret technology that can be used to beam a person into a parallel universe where different version's of the same people exist and those other version's of those people have all of the same memories from the last time that you saw the preceding version's of those people.

Exploding Head Syndrome: A Mind-Blowing Sleep Disorder By Marc Lallanilla, Live Science Contributor | May 12, 2014 01:31pm ET - See more at: http://www.livescience.com/45532-exploding-head-syndrome-sleep-disorder.html#sthash.lfp4D9DF.dpuf 20% of us have 'exploding head syndrome' where we hear loud, imaginary noises Condition occurs as a person is dropping off and hears abrupt loud noise Stops sleep and some people believe they are having a seizure or a stroke A third of people with condition also suffer isolated sleep paralysis This is where a person is waking up but cannot move their body http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3027308/Have-woken-hearing-bang-night-20-exploding-head-syndrome-hear-loud-imaginary-noises.html
I'd venture a guess that's it's repressed trauma - something frightening or disturbing from childhood. Something long repressed. And as you drift off to sleep, the unconscious mind intrudes into the area of consciousness and the two mix for a time. It would be fun to see if you could subject this to analysis - and whether that would change the "banging".
Exploding head syndrome
Seriously? You want a diagnosis from a stranger who has never seen you and has no medical training?
Believe it or not, its called "Exploding Head Syndrome" because sleep scientists had no other better choice for words.
No one can diagnose you over the internet, dude. Sorry.
Salam, Perhaps it is a jinn. Seek refugee in Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) from Satan, recite surahs 113 and 114 in the Quran, recite ayatul kursi. This may help, Inshallah.
In all my sharing of gym showers, never have I seen anything as described on Men's Health, by Contributor's experiences with jacking off, in such facilities....of course I'm associated with Martial Arts exhibitions, which involve mature young men, typically, who demonstrate their athletic skills, and not their hand job abilities.
Just go on like i didn't see anything. I have seen this before.
I would report their behavior. It's criminal activity, afterall.
Wonder why I can see myself outside my body.
I'd ask if I can join or help him
join him asap
No damage but make sure you eat 3 balanced so you don't eat a whole pizza oh and take your vitamins and try on clothes, play fashion show w/ music and try on your loose stuff and tight items, clothing and a scale is the best indicator. Pls. keep in mind that you are a growing girl. 3500 calories is 1 pound the pizza was at a minimum made you gain 1 lb.
barely any damage (on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 is really bad damage, I'd rate you at 1). I actually recommend having such a meal (high-carb cheat meal) every 10 days as extended periods of dieting result in the decrease of leptin levels, a hormone critical for fat loss.
will you gain weight from eating a large pizza? No. but you will if you keep doing it on a regular basis for a good few weeks. (if you want to eat a large pizza to yourself now and than, go for it but don't do it too frequent)
Is the pizza 20 feet long? No? Probably not then lol. One meal won't make you fat.
mate I just ate a whole box of krispey kremes, I usually eat around 3500 calories a day to bulk up my physique, ive easily eaten 10 000 today, but it doesn't matter because I don't do it everyday, and neither should you do it everyday, just eat the damn pizza
You'll look like an alien craft
That sound's like my diet when I was a kid, but I have a high metabolism and was always active. Everybody's different. We had a girl in high school that could eat more than what you listed with no ill effects. I'm a big eater, but I have friends that can eat twice what I can in a day.
If I were you, I would do out with any foods that are high calorie low nutritional value. Like the kettle corn, chocolate bear paw and the nuts. Almonds or pistachios would be a better alternative. Spaghetti if it's whole grain is good but meatballs are just high calorie. Just sub veggies for meat anywhere you can and stick to lean meats like fish, turkey and chicken. Pork and beef are harder to digest and also higher calorie.
It's a lot of food and it's not great food. You're consuming a ton of empty carbs and not enough actual FOOD that will keep you feeling full and provide proper nutrition.
The quantity is a little high, but the sugar content is far worse for you. Get rid of the brownies, the granola bar, the cliff bar, the kettle corn and the desserts and you'll be doing great.
It does seem to be a lot of food, but if you are healthy and not gaining weight, then it is fine.
There is no way to grow taller FASTER. You just NEED TO BE PATIENT, and hope that you generic makeup allows you to be taller. Your final height is determined by your GENES, your DNA, that you got from your mother and your father. You can be SHORTER if you have a bad diet during childhood, but a good diet does NOT make you taller.
Also im 15
You can't.
Diet ,good sleep,yoga is the key. Stretching exercises can work as well
try calcium , check with Doctor
give it time too happen on it's own
Our body is made up of chemicals that react to our brain and when these chemicals are lacking our brain gets tripped up and confused. Doctors, through tests can determine which chemical is lacking and thus give pills that helps the body produce these chemicals.
My psychiatrist says that in at least 65% of cases antidepressants don't work. On the most part the effects felt are a placebo.
Yes. My husband takes Xanax, Abilify and Lexapro. And they are extremely helpful. He is a completely different person than who I married. I could just hug his doctor for helping us out.
yes they work if there taken properly
So Im 18 and I hate the taste of milk, but I'm starting to notice the affects low calcium has to my body. If I drink chocolate milk (I still hate the taste but it makes it bearable) will I be getting enough calcium in my body. I know I can take calcium pills but I won't have a job till the summer. I'd be drinking a cup of chocolate milk every 3 days. I wouldn't be able to able to do it everyday because I really just don't like it.know any fruits that have calcium???
Almond milk, Soy milk and Rice milk are all fortified with 30% calcium and per glass (and Vitamin D for absorption), exactly the same as cow's milk. You can also get calcium gummies (fruit flavour). Not too expensive if you get them at Costco.
List of fruits that you can eat as a replacement to milk for your calcium intake: Oranges and Tangerines, Dried Apricots, Kiwi, Dates, Dried Figs, Rhubarb, Prickly Pears, Prunes. You can also try yogurt, orange juice and rice beverages.
I lost 10 lb since I started drinking Weight Loss Green Store Tea product !! of course you have to be conscious of it and not eat as often if your body tells you youre not hungry. If you keep eating the same amount, whats the point? but you will not feel as hungry and I stand by it
If today is your cheat day, then it is fine. However, Alfredo sauce has been considered "heart attack on a plate."
It can be easy to make with chicken, spices, pasta, heavy cream, butter, parmesan cheese and cream cheese. BUT it is loaded with calories, fat and sodium.
the chicken is fine but the cream sauce has lots of calories
chicken is good; just don't eat gobs of sauce.
My 4 year old daughter is the only one affected Mostly on her arms, but some on legs and torso. She has probably 20-30 bumps starts as a welt looks like a mosquito bite but quickly. Intensely itchy. Both I and a friend who has experience have checked her bed and cannot find any signs of bed bugs. She is sensitive to insect bites in general anyway so she may have reaction from say dust mites?? I don t know. I even thought she is getting bit at school but she has fresh bumps appear here all the time. New spot happen daily. Could it be skin parasite
If your child is in discomfort, I would advise seeing a doctor, if that's possible for you.
Perhaps an allergy to a product that you use with her. A baby shampoo, etc.
Take her to the M.D.
It sounds like you are going through a lot right now. Thank you for reaching out for help! Please know that there are people who can and will help you with what you are going through. You may want to consider talking with a counselor at a hotline. There are many hotlines that are 24/7 and will work with you and situations like yours. Some even have email and/or chat if you would prefer. Hopefully, you will continue to reach out! Sincerely, KO, Counselor
No of course not! The suicide hot line is there to help you anonymously. They are not going to throw you in a padded room. It is for YOUR benefit.
no you don't end up in a padded cell forever, you may end up in a hospital for a while, I have been there, but is intended to help you
Guys I'm not suicidal, I just want to know if my know it all dad is telling the truth
No, that's total bs. Your dad sounds like a db.
no u get one night and maybe meds. if ur bad maybe a few nights. and it isnt padded unles itsa specific type of suicidal.
No. They are usually anonymous. They are there to help, hook you up with resources and give an ear when in need.
if they feel that your a danger to yourself the longest they can hold you is 72 hours
They will only help and give you advice that works for you. Just do it!
they talk you down. you don't even have to tell them who you are.
No it's not weird at all, he's your brother it's perfectly fine, I mean some brother even go as far as sleeping naked with one another in the same room, if there comfortable enough for it, some make a big deal of things others don't ,
You should never sleep in your ordinary day clothes. The fewer clothes you wear to bed the better. Many men and teens sleep completely naked these days as it gives a deeper sleep and allows the entire skin to totally relax and rejuvenate. It is quite normal for brothers to sleep naked in the same room as one another (and indeed also normal for two friends to do so during a sleepover). Being naked does not equal having sex!
NO not at all. Everyone sleeps in whatever there comfortable with. You can sleep nude if you want and so could he for that matter and it wouldn't be weird.
No it's not weird it's more comfortable sleeping naked, it lets the body breath. Nakedness has nothing to do with sex.
Eww
It isn't as long as you don't sleep in the same bed.
No, as you are both boys. It would be more weirder if you slept in a room with your "Sister"
not at all , enjoy shirtless, bottomless, inner wear less bodies. regards.
Depends how warm /cold it is. < M
no it's not
No, You will be fine. Provided you don't keep breathing it in.
I'd say so
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product has been an added resource in maintaining weight loss. I love this, I am a tea drinker, and this tea was no different to me to have during my day. I drink at least to cups a day and feel full. It has helped suppress my appetite and is not too bitter tasting .
You weren't dehydrated. Whether you drink water or soda or whatever, liquid is liquid; it's not like you have to drink water specifically in order to stay 'hydrated'. It may be that your body was retaining excess fluid for whatever reason, and that drained off causing you to lose a few pounds. The same happens to me when I stop drinking alcohol, in the first couple of days that follow I lose a few pounds also.
It was water loss.
Yeah maybe
You should discuss this with your doctor at your next appointment. This would have been set up when you were told of your diagnosis. Generally there are a whole range of appointments set up for various tests and discussions with specialists.
I'm sorry for your diagnosis. First step is to talk to your doctor. Find out all you can about exactly what cancer you have and what stage it is. Your doctor should have/be putting together a treatment plan for you. After that, you might want to spend some time on reputable cancer websites to learn all you can. Good luck.
Well, you wait to see what treatment options there are. Surgery, chemo and radiation are the usual possible treatments. If you work, you may need to take some time off. You may need the support of family. But until you get a stage, treatment plan, you can't really do anything.
Well, if you've really been diagnosed, your doctor should have already discussed this with you. You will be referred to either a radiation oncologist or medical oncologist or both. You'll be scheduled for blood work, an MRI and probably a PET scan. Your cancer team will determine the best course of action depending on your particular type of cancer. You might be referred to a surgeon to attempt to remove the tumoright or tumors. Followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Your life will become a whirlwind of doctors, blood tests, scans and treatments. After treatment has ended, you'll be scheduled for regular followups for 5 years.
I'm sorry. Surely, your doctor took time to talk to you about where you are in your illness and possible treatment(s). Your doctor should also have recommended some Oncologists for you to speak with. Good luck and God bless. It is definitely possible to beat cancer.
It seems strange that you don't have any idea what type of treatment is being recommended. I had suggestions of treatment plans even before we definitively knew the tumor was cancerous.
um, testicular cancer? breast cancer? pancreatic cancer? all have different survival rates, depending on the stage of the cancer when diagnosed. are you young? old? many variables to consider and plug into the equation.
The doctor who diagnosed you will tell you what comes next
What you are supposed to do, is consult the doctor that diagnosed you. He will tell you what comes next.
Thats normal babe
Not unusual at all - in fact the norm for the left to hang slightly lower than the right. Not unusual for there to be a slight difference in size. But if the size is a big difference then tell your parents you have an issue and see a urologist. Once you get past that first exam and him handling your balls, you are fine. Been there and done that, awkward at first but no big deal.
It's not uncommon for one testicle to be larger than the other. And it's normal and all men that one hang lower than the other.
One is lower so they won't jam up.
It can mean a variety of things. Just because you are stage 4 doesn't mean you will die. I had a land lord that had stage 4 lymphoma 8 years ago. She is now cured. People survive being stage 4 all the time. Your doctor should have discussed this with you.
No, not at all. Some people live for years with stage 4 cancer. My cousin did. And she had stage 4 Breast and Lung Cancer. Lived for nearly 4 years.
The TNM classification of tumors vary depending on the type of tumor. In most instances metastasis, classified as M1 means a stage 4 tumor. It can also mean an extremely locally aggressive tumor. Advanced tumour stage means increased chances of mortality and morbidity. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that the patient has only 3 to 4 months left
With Stage 4, you'll die if you rely only on the traditional treatment only. Stage 4 does not have to be a death sentence. Do the homework on alternative cancer treatments, the only other option is to die. .
I've been living with Stage IV breast cancer for over four years. This doesn't mean I'm cured ... it will kill me ... but I'm living longer than "a few months." The fact that you are "anonymous" makes me doubt your question. Cancer is an umbrella term for over 200 diseases and no doctor simply says, "You have Stage IV cancer." No details, no sympathy.
Well if you had stage 4 lung cancer, it's likely to be in your brain and you wouldn't be asking on ya...
Not necessarily. Some stage 4 cancer is treatable for more than a few months. Talk to your doctor about this.
Depends what type of cancer but stage 4 means it has spread somewhere else and is not curable and nothig can be done but what did your oncologist tell you?. - My friend had breast cancer and by the time she went to doctors it had spread to her bones but that was about 6 years ago and with treatment she is stil leading a normal life, Good Luck
Not at all I personally know number of persons who cure from cancer and live happily even in some cases doctors wasn't sure they can recover
It depends on the cancer. I was at stage III/IV and I am now in remission, and expect to stay there. My cancer responds well to treatment. Other cancers, like lung and colon cancer, do not, especially in late stages.
No, it's the same. Sugar and milk doesn't change the amount of caffeine in the coffee.
No. Adding sugar and milk doesn't make any difference to the caffeine content or how it will affect you.
Nope. Coffee is coffee. The amount of cream and sugar means nothing.
No. I may taste less strong because of the milk but the coffee is still the same strength whether you drink it black or with cream.
what the difference between affect and effect?

Boston? That's the city I live in, and I would be shocked and confused upon seeing it used for a child. That doesn't sound like a name. It's a city. It's like naming a child Providence or San Diego
Those are terrible. Boston? Ugh.
Ryce? Oh good god.
So many rude people on this site. This guy oviously does not know the definition of "Orphan". You can get a bigger booty by doing squats, lunges, and other exercises to do this your legs, i think wall sits may be one. There are videos on youtube that can help :)
Im pretty sure you can get a good booty by just doing squats without weights, though it may take longer than if you were doing squats with weights
Squats. Lunges. Leg raises.
google ´how to get a rounder booty´ and a bunch of tips will come up but squats have worked great for me but I don't know if that´s bad for you back.
Photoshop you orphan it works like a charm
the pirate's eternal question.
your butt is what it is - you cannot change the shape or size of it
I had light acne scarring between my chin and neck area. I used a lotion called bevoline and it got rid of my acne scars as well as my acne. It comes in a gray and blue box not expensive at all. They are now also offering it on Amazon. I hope my answer helps. Good luck!
Relax - these help with both acne and acne scars - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I think they most likely had acne.
A few are ok... "Moon face" might be an issue, but that is rare for males and females.
Beauty is within.
This is perfectly normal. A lot of guys develop leg hair before they develop armpit hair. Armpit hair is usually the slowest to grow on most guys. Since you are 13, expect to see signs of your armpit hair between now and the age of 16.
Youre gonna have that, armpit hair is the slowest to grow compare to your pube or leg hair, i am 18 and still i have a little armpit hair. This process is going on specially in puberty and just be patient. Since you begin to see changes in your body, assume that your armpit hair will grow soon.
Pit hair can come in any time during puberty. Did not say anything about pubes- but puberty begins before you even develop leg and pubic hair.
you'll just have to wait till it grows. its perfectly normal everyone's hair grow at there own time. its not a bad thing plus its ok you don't have to shave. your really lucky.

5'5 is the average height in female
64.6 inches The average female American woman's height is 163 to 164 cm, which is approximately 64.2 to 64.6 inches, which is approximately 5 foot – 5 inches tall. (for white females*).
Approximately 5' 6"
In the the UK and US it's 5'4 though it's shorter or taller in different countries depending on their living conditions/lifestyle.
- short stature decrease risk of 'venous insufficiency' source : 'tall' in http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/... - shorter stature, is more resistant against cancer, diabetes, aging source : 'resistant to cancer and diabetes and are somewhat protected against aging.[6][12][13] This is consistent with findings in mice with a defective growth hormone receptor gene.[7]' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron_synd... - shorter stature need lower blood pressure to stay alive, lower blood pressure is healthier source : 'Because smaller animals (for example rats) function at a lower blood pressure, they need less oncotic pressure to balance this, and thus need less albumin to maintain proper fluid distribution.' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albu...

Both male emission and female juice are "acquired taste". It is almost certain first-timer (even until the 10th time) likely won't like the taste, either their own or their partner's. However, if both insists on giving themselves a chance to "expand" their sexual horizon, and "partake" of these "emblems" (theirs or their partner's), very likely when their love matures, they'll crave for each other emission and their own. PS: Hence comes terms like "snowballing" and "c*m swapping"
oh yea she'll dig it their all curious at to what that would be like all girls have that fantasy..some wont admit it but they all do not bragging but ive had alot i ask them all..thats the answer i get most the fantasy thing

All the other guys do, so why worry about it? Just do it.
Sounds like your weed is being laced with something.
Because you are starting to look like a druggie. That what happens after long term use.

Surely, you must realize that all those women you see in porn movies who are screaming and moaning are just ACTING!
Some do, my girl wants more sex then I do
That all depends on the person. ALso in porn what you see is all fake.
at 14 you should not be watching that illegal smut, so there is no answer for you
im waiting to find out on that one.

Girls stop growing way before guy do. I'm 4'9 and have been like that since 6th grade. I'm 18 now. My friend though is 5'6 and stopped growing at 13.
18-19 years old. Some girls just stop growing earlier tho. My best friend is 4'11 and she's been like that since middle school. lol She's 24 now.
Normally, they stop growing when they upgrade from a 3-hook bra to a 4-hook and move from Tampons to Adult Diapers.
15 for height.
like 65... up until then, they just keep getting fatter and fatter and fatter... and fatter.. and fatter.

I want to lose at least 75 lbs. I am a tall former college athlete (23 years old) who lifts weights. 6'6" 377 lbs. I have a high BMI and high blood pressure. Body fat percentage is probably high as well. How can I lose weight relatively quickly does anyone recommend VLCD (very low calorie Diet)? I love exercising, so working out is not the problem, it is the diet. Please help. I want to lose at least 75 lbs. I know it can be done, and with my body type, and considering how much I weigh, it shouldn't be a problem to lose more than the recommended 1-2 lbs a week. I know I can lose more.
I lost 60 lbs. in a year with strict dieting and lots of exercise, but I was 50 at the time and it's harder for older people. I eliminated beer, chips, cookies, cake, ice cream, pie and pastries.
I really needed to lose Weight I’m approaching my 32th birthday and I have noticed thats its getting harder and harder to lose Weight. I was desperate because I could no longer fit into my cute clothes and fat pants are just not for me! I just started “ Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea ” Tea its only been two weeks and already five pounds down and it tastes great!!! Thanks Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea .

Self harm is just one of the many symptoms of depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
Advice? Get counseling. Get a life. Make one nice big cut from ear to ear.
Go to counselling
Why would you hurt ur self
Ive noticed that all the four time ive been attacked Im almost asleep ,but awake enough to feel them, first time i seen them circle me and after that i just feel thish weight climb on top of me and i cant breathe,move, or talk its like im being strangled or chocked im literally motion less and cant do **** when they do this for like 10 seconds then they go away and comes back when it feels like it.
Sleep paralysis is not caused by demons. For years, I had sleep Paralysis 3-5 times a week. Turns out (as with some of the posters above), I had a sleep disorder. I take medication now and it happens about 3x a year.
These are not demons...this is sleep paralysis. See a doctor
Sounds like sleep paralysis. I get it too sometimes.
This is simply your brain waking up "in the wrong order". See your doctor to see if they can help. I got a cpap and that kind of event stopped for me.
Recite Ayatul kursi and the four kuls before sleeping (from Quran). Trust me it will work and if it doesnt its something psychological or physiological.
your weak spiritually. You need Jesus as lord and savior. Strengthen your spirit with the word of god and prayer. Read your bible(King James Bible holy scriptures), and pray to God in Jesus name. Come to the knowledge of Jesus. you need to be at the point(mental emotional decision making) where your desire is to repent for your sins, and accept Jesus as savior.
Yes. it does not matter what source the lactose comes from. If you can't digest it source does not matter.
Weird. However, human breast milk contains the sugar lactose, so if you are lacking lactase, you will have the same problems with all mammalian milk.
I believe you will experience the same symptoms, though they may not be as severe. Either way, I would not attempt to do so. Best of luck.
That has to be about the weirdest questions i've ever read on here...and yet i want to know the answer.
I have no idea but I'd guess, yes you will . Breast milk tastes gross BTW!
Your fart will stink
No. You are not a cow.
If you have times when you see them and are unable to say anything at all, then that's selective mutism. If you're able to say some things, but just feeling awkward when you do it, then that would just be shyness.
Selective mutism is just a name given to when someone cannot talk do to anxieties with certain people All this means is that your parents intimidate you or make you feel afraid. It's NOT A DISEASE, it's a symptom, and in this case, a symptom of either intimidation or you being a bad person.
It depends on your age and their age.
Im 17 and 5"4 , you will grow more if you eat a good diet. LOTS of protein and calcium, and all the other nutrients. I didnt eat well, dont make the mistake i did.
There's a good chance you'll still grow yes, 14 is still young
Should, most guys don't finish until 15-18.
We cannot possibly know if you're going to continue to go or not. We know nothing about you.
im afraid . its yes

No it's not! Just because you're a little freaked out that woman used to be a man doesn't mean you're transphobic at all its normal instinct and you prefer the real thing there's nothing wrong with that!
I've never heard that term 'trnasphobic' before, but I would never have sex with someone with a fake vagina claiming to be a woman. You don't get to chose your gender just because you decided to have parts cut off.
Nah. Your right to bodily autonomy includes the right to insist that all the people you engage in sex with have whatever preferred genitalia you like. However, your insistence on using scare quotes around the word woman in your sentence above? Is actually pretty transphobic.
No not really. Im female and I would be freaked out to have sex with a male who has a fake penis. Its just normal instinct I guess. We like things to be natural.
A lot of schools have re-do exams. You should ask about that. (If you're in high school or middle school)
I am so sorry! If you studied really hard (even if you get an f) that is what matters to your parents. If you didn't even try, then make a good resolution to do better. This might take 5 min., but it always helps. Take out a paper and pen and jot down ways to bring your grades up next year or semester.. Then go to bed. The more sleep you have, the better you'll do in the morning. Try harder next time. I hope it doesn't go to bad. Goodnight!
I am desperately trying to find my correct identity and try to be like the people in such group so I won't have to be an outcast anymore, even if it involves me having to modify my own identity to suit theirs. Here's my identity: I'm non-violent, self-conscious, introverted, non-rebellious and non-condescending. I also don't drink, smoke or do drugs. I don't gossip on garbage like actors, but I do have a preference of flowing trends. I also have a deep interest in cycling and technology. I prefer working in the offfice, not manual hard labour. I also prefer living in or near the city.
F R E A K !!!
Metrosexuality is not an identity but simply a grooming and dress style. If your health professionals cannot help you with finding your identity I very much doubt if anyone here can.
Seeking a 'correct' identity seems to be a little strange. I would advocate seeking your authentic self rather than compromising it to fit in.
Don't worry about fitting in to an identity. Find friends in all types of people and be happy with who you are.That isn't to say don't stop improving yourself, just love yourself and who you will become.
Become a monk or saint, if possible. Try hetero, which is a combining form meaning “different,” “other,” used in the formation of compound words: There is no harm in it. That will suit you best.
Sounds like a transliberal.
Wet dreams only happen when you are not ejaculating regularly by means of masturbation or sex. Disregard what vip said. Drinking water or any liquid has absolutely nothing to do with wet dreams.
Most guys who masturbate regularly don't have many if any wet dreams. So odd you'd have lots when masturbating frequently (average is at least once a day for teens).
Wet dreams are not caused by drinking water... LOL
You should reduce your intake of liquids before bedtime. Especially water. Sorry about your wet dreams.
i hate wet dreams i dreamt i was taking oprah from behind i awoke after i cu mm ed
Probably because you 14. You might not be masturbating ENOUGH. Yes, stress can affect dreams and is known cause of ordinary bedwetting. < M
It's how you are 'made' related. No control over it. healthy-relationship-dating.com/wet-dre...

because it's none of your business and your sister is her own person.
Real men don't sleep with hoes.
We all got together and had a meeting to decide how to make your life miserable. I fought hard in your favor but the others wouldn't listen. You once farted in an elevator full of Iranian businessmen and that is why it all came down on you.
If i was against you you would be bleeding from 3 holes.
Actually you are against to yourself.
It doesn't know you.
7 millimeters is equivalent to 0.2 inches. Hmmm, not very big at all. In fact it is a micro penis you have.
Dang, dude are you going to screw the African Elephants with that baseball bat?! You'll scare the women off, with that monster! But, don't get big-headed. I'm rocking with a 9.7 millimeter penis, right here. I'm sexing up the sexy female dolphins...
yes it is a monster dick at 7 mm
a 1/4 inch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.275591 inches is huge
As long as you didn't put your fingers in then no. Otherwise it's a super duper slim chance but I think you're absolutely fine.
No. Semen has to get deep inside her to get her pregnant.
Make her into what, exactly? Weird AND grammatically abhorent.
There is no cure for Autism unfortunately. You can join support groups, research, and try to live as normal life as possible. Changes in the way the medical field and the rest of the world perceive people with Autism are helping lead the way for treatment changes, but there is still no cure. Good luck to you!
No, but don't worry about that. People who push you away just because you have asperger's are not real friends. You will find someone that cares for you. I have a lot of friends that have autism and asperger's, and they're amazing people and they're so smart. Love yourself and don't let this bring you down
You may be able to. We haven't even identified just what causes autism. It's definitely a brain defect, but we don't know a defect of what.
No. I can't say from experience. However, do your best not to let it get you down. There have been plenty of famous people with Asperger's.
Watch movies with normal people. Fake being normal until eventually it becomes second nature. Learn how to act, basically be an actor in your life.
Yes, you can totally cure yourself.
No you just have to live with it
honestly, if they are truly addicted, there's not much you can do except talk them out of it... but in the end, only they can decide if they will take drugs or not
If it cause dad to be abusive or unable to work, contact Child Protective Services. Both he and sister are being a horrible influence on you. They both need to be in rehab.
You have to take away all the drugs and alcohol.
you probably cant its up to them

I'm 6'6 and weigh 238ibs.
It's not. The target weight for a 5'7" adult female is 140lbs. You are mistaken if you think 126 is medically overweight.
It is nowhere near overweight. At 5ft 7, it's actually on the lighter side and would be underweight for a male
Source?
Look up a BMI calculator online and use it. I don't think overweight.
It's not.
It isn't. Smack dab in the middle of normal weight range.
Because you are too heavy for your body.

You know the ideal sugar intake for a male is about 37 grams (about 9 teaspoons). Your 200g is over 5x the amount you're supposed to have. You could wind up gaining weight (fat) and have pancreatic issues that affect your blood sugar.
you get more than 200 grams of sugar a day, guaranteed.
Extremely risky yes, you're moving towards obesity and/or diabetes. 200 grams is over 7 ounces, or almost half a POUND of sugar. You're basically killing yourself.
Cancer cells love sugar, so don't go nuts with it. .
Yes, you just have to be really careful and smart about what you eat. You need to make sure you're getting enough protein.
Heck yes
Sure, if cannibals like me can then vegans can too.
Easily, Pasta + Veg is one of the best meals you have if you're running a marathon.
Sure why not
That is high, but what you need to do about it depends on his overall health and medical status, whether or not he has a condition that could be severely compromised by BP that high. However, you should do three readings and average them. Make sure he has been sitting quietly for five minutes before you do the readings. His feet should be flat on the floor and his back supported and he shouldn't move or talk while you are measuring. No coffee or food in the hour before the check. Wait three or four minutes between each reading. If all the readings are high, check with your doctor and make an appointment.
First of all, did you take it resting? To get an accurate reading, he should have been sitting still for ten minutes, not drinking coffee and not getting annoyed by the news. 166/97 is high, but not an emergency. If that's his reading at rest, he should see a doctor.
No. Have him make an appointment with his GP or Practice Nurse. BTW Many home BP monitors are unreliable plus results can be unreliable if the measuring technique is not correct - rest for >15 minutes beforehand, no talking, make sure the cuff is lined up according to artery, make sure monitor is level with heart, etc. Plus one BP measurement is meaningless -- it is the underlying pattern which is important.
Not yet. BP should always be taken twice, 5 mins after the first one. My UK Doctor told me this, the second one is the true reading. No caffeine for 30 minutes before.
Make an appointment to see your family doctor.
maybe he might have eaten to much salty foods? look after his diet and of course see a doctor about this :)
try taking it again in an hour
It's wonderful
Im the same. I don't have any friends because i don't want to get hurt. I once had a best friend for 7 years who i loved and she broke me. There is nothing wrong with it if you prefer it that way. I also prefer to be alone
No... you're an introvert.
Lately, I just feel so out of it. I can't focus in school, I'm always tired yet all I do is sleep, and I can't eat too much. I'm so tired of school, of everyone around me, of everything really. I really don't see the reason to continue moving forward. My grades are going down even though I used to be a straight A student and I try so hard to bring them up, but at the same time I don't seem to care. I want to feel SOMETHING again. I feel so numb to everything around me.
The term for your condition is either situational or clinical depression. It can be easily diagnosed and treated effectively. However, you must take the initiative and consult a doctor, or better yet a psychiatrist. Don't wait, because this condition will not resolve itself. This is generally a heredity brain chemistry disorder and can be easily diagnosed and effectively treated.
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online. sometimes ur suposed to be good not necesarily studious.
I had some acne, 2-3 major pimples on my right cheek. And 5-6 on my left cheek. I cosulted a determalogist. He gave me a medicine to eat (contimdyn) and a face wash (neutrogena oil free acne face wash), and a tube to apply on my pimples after which my acne is completely gone in 15 days. However it left behind some scarring, my doctor said that medicine with help with scarring however it lightened the ones I've on my right cheek but in left cheek they're same and dark. What should I do? Help.
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I really like this Arganrain oil because it comes with everything you need for a healthy skin. My acne scars cleared up completely. I recommend you use it for acne problems.
acne scarring
I had light acne scarring between my chin and neck area. I used a lotion called bevoline and it got rid of my acne scars as well as my acne. It comes in a gey and blue box not expensive at all.
invicible scars. Used on acne scars and this stuff works!
you can apply egg white mask on your face for half an hour to get rid of pimples.it is also helpful in glowing skin
Hey all, I am a female and have lately been experiencing dizziness, weakness and tiredness. I am conserned I may be anaemic but I don't know what to say to my parents so they will take me to the doctor, you have to be 16 here to book your own fully confidential appointment so my mum would have to know. But, she brushes off a lot of the health things I ask her about (example she brushed of my acne for years and when she finally addressed it the doctor seemed quite conserned about it). I don't know what to do andone have any tips for asking my parents?
Just tell your parents the symptoms you've been having and explain that you are concerned you might be anemic. If they don't take you seriously, show them some of your research about the symptoms of the condition and reasons why it should be treated.
Tell your mother about the symptoms, tell her you're worried you may have anaemia, and ask her to book you a doctor's appointment. Simple.
tell them its dangers!
How? Cold Turkey. I put lighters, ash trays, etc. in a desk drawer April 10, 2010, closed the drawer, and haven't opened it since. Why? Two heart attacks. Now that I've been tobacco free for 6 years, I understand what people were saying when they said smokers stink. Just waking past a smoker on the street now, the odor is almost enough to make me gag.
Wellbutrin. I wasn't a heavy smoker - 1/2 a pack a day more or less but I had smoked for 25 years. It worked for me and I never really missed it. My husband was a heavier smoker than me 2/3 a pack but he really loved smoking. He managed to quit but missed it a whole lot and now he gapes with his gape juice having nicotine in it. He, too, quit with Wellbutrin.
I started watching the scary anti smoking ads and it really motivates me honestly.
Disagree
That's what you WANT. I dye my armpit hair pink, the hair on my head purple, buy clothes from Free People and walk around in paisley VANS (which MY generation created BTW!!), get myself a boy toy, listen to Nine Inch Nails and you guys say "ewww gross". You think old SHOULD be boring and it bothers you when it isn't....
Disagree. Old means you don't have to care about what other people think. You can go out and be silly, absurd, do outrageous stuff and you don't care. It's a lot of freedom.
No. a lot of seniors have interesting stories to tell. when i was a kid, my mum friend who was like a grandma to me since i never met any of mine, she would take me to her seniors pancake breakfasts with her some times and i would sit there and listen to them chat about a lot of cool stuff that had happened in the past etc.. In today's world people would just ignore them and play on their phones instead.
Old is not boring. If anything it's an achievement.
Old people have seen it all and they're tired. If that makes them "boring," so be it.
Sometimes old is better. Like old movies and video games and cartoons you grew up with
Usually I find that: Old = Experienced. They have seen more than most of us.
100% agreed
I do this a lite bit as well. You're an enabler. If it's hurting you, I would address it. Your happiness comes first. Let people make mistakes and learn on their own. Fixing their problems doesn't always do them a favour. Keep in mind that they have the responsibility for their actions, not you. Good luck!
It can be a sign of needing approval and seeking to buy people's affections by constantly doing them favors and going out your way to please them. Everything in moderation can be good , but many things in excess are no good.
Yes its a manufacturing defect in some people.They forget their own problem and help others.They always get rewarded for that.
You don't need therapy for it but I recommend you try to tone it down a bit and talk to people you know won't laugh at you e.c.t so they could help
No. It's called being a "people pleaser"
Something has changed. Professionals have discovered flavor enhancers added to food now, not precisely listed in ingredients. Only way to defeat is to make fresh food and eat set limited amounts rather than prepared food. People have a become acclimated to larger portions, drink more soda, indulge in more emotional eating, and walk less. Advertising and marketing improvement increase demand. People are eating more calorically dense food even if I appears thgey eat less. For example example, one dube if full fat cheese is 110 calories, same as a half lb of kale.
people become fat from over eating and lack of movement if your becoming fat but only eating few calories you may be undermining yourself or have a thyroid problem
-Lack of exercise -Might be eating more then they realise -Depends on what food they are eating during the day if the food is high in calories - Other health problems they should go see a doctor about

Just because Web MD says you have cancer literally every time you type something in doesn't mean it's true. If you think you have cancer, you should go to the doctor immediately. But, to be honest, you're still growing- when you're hitting puberty your body starts acting crazy and you have weird eating habits, trust me. I would see a doctor as soon as possible, just in case.
More likely, you just have some digestive issues. Stomach cancer in someone your age is almost unheard of. Don't worry. Discuss this with your family doctor. He or she may refer you to a gastroenterologist to run some tests on your digestive system.
Only your doctor can answer this after various tests but it doesnt sound like stomach cancer, my dad died of stomach cancer and he never had heartburn - maybe you have excess stomach acid by eatig spicy food or similar.
Sigh.....total imagination Heartburn has nothing to do with stomach cancer.
Good Heaven's No! Heartburn is extremely common, I've had it since I was in my teens, been 35 years now, and still have it. Mention it to your doctor on your next visit, he will give you something for it.
See your local doctor, specifically someone who knows this field would be good. The more trained the person the better. But don't see a naturopath or similar, as this will give a biased view
It sounds like you might have gotten a bug and still have an irritated digestive system from it. But, if it worries you then go to the doctor so you can stop worrying.
Sounds like indigestion
No. You have a little heartburn. It is not cancer.
Your skin is a very good shield and unless i's leisured, you can't get an infection through your skin. But as experiments have proven, you unvolontarily touch your lips, your nose, your eyes, dozens of times in just half an hour. And then the little invaders got you. See, I'm wearing glasses, and by putting them back into their right position, it's almost impossible not to touch my lower eyelid. And there I had it, viral conjunctivis. Which is a good disease, btw, it made me appreciate audio books.
Actual case: Let's say you touched some surface with Staph aureus. It may get on a small cut near your finger tips and be happy there. Then you prepare a meal for a family reunion. You slice up a nice ham and keep in warm for a few hours before serving it. Then everyone in your family gets staph food poisoning.... Vomiting and pooping all night long.
Yes, you could still get an infectious disease through a crack or cut in your skin.
wtf
Try asking a guy for sex....9 times out of 10 they'll say yes
so, basically what you want to do is get a pillow, and fold it in half, so it sorta stands up like a triangle? then put your legs on the sides of it so you're sitting on the triangle, then move your vagina back and forth and deep into the pillow. hope this helped.
That's not really an effective way to do it. Try something else.
use moms dildo like everyone else
If you are living paycheck to paycheck, its probably not a good time to pay for braces I did $1200 down and pay $200 a month for my braces ($6000 total over the course of 2 years)
I had them. They aren't cheap that's for sure. I think mine were around 2500 could of been cheaper I can't remember though
Ask the orthodontist
TYESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You could be carrying a disease, or illness but you might just be a carrier, therefor not showing any signs other than the lymph nodes of the illness
Conditions where lymph nodes CHANGE are a reason to investigate. If you have always had this, there is little cause for concern. Book an appointment with your GP if unsure.
it's annoying
So, I went to the dentist today, and they told me that I have wisdom teeth coming in. However, I have VERY crowded teeth, and they can not wait for the tooth to pop up before they pull it. So they will have to make an incision in my gum to pull it out. I was wondering, will they put me under general anesthetic (so I m unconscious temporarily) or local anesthetic (so the area is numbed). I thought that maybe they would give me general anesthetic because they have to make an incision. But I don t know....
The same thing happened to me. They'll give you a choice between general anesthetic or local. I got general cause i feel like its a lot easier to be totally out of it then to see all the tools there using and be freaked out.
There are various ways to do this. Ask your dentist. Only he knows what he's going to do. You have every right to ask the question. After all, it's your body.
The dentist will do it the way you desire.
21-33 is normal for a female
18-28% is considered healthy for females. Look it up online.
I don't know honey but ur only 15... I'm sure ur beautiful and u don't need to worry about ur weight💜
Difficult to say. However the important thing is that it is in the right places.
Ok I hit the Elliptical and can burn over 800 calories in an hour. If you go three time a week and only burn 200 then you are not doing something right. Nuts are not really that good for you....especially covered in chocolate.
John, ''a-s-s'' is apparently blanked out if I type it. I'm burning 200/session but I will try to bump it up to 300-350. I am already quite muscular but my waist is really thin. Posture's kinda **** too which makes it stick out.. thanks for the advice!!

Stop picking your nose just may help
Just don't pick your nose. Do you know how many germs are in a booger?
don't pick your nose. blow it using a tissue, plus picking your nose is nasty af
Stop picking it.
the obvious solution is to stop picking it

It is absolutely okay to exercise, and it's recommended for all ages (weights, heights, etc). Just do not push yourself too hard, for that can lead to straining. It's best if you started with a weight that's easier to lift. I recommend having a diet with a bit more fat in it if you want to gain weight.
you'll be fine to go too a gym
Only if you drop a weight on your foot ... If you don't know what you're doing, suggest you ask someone or take a class, as weight lifting CAN be 'done wrong' & could hurt you....

Sigh....we are not as fragile as you seem to think, kid. Jeez.
Most people have thoughts. Thoughts are generally invisible to other people. Sometimes thoughts are funny. Maybe she is thinking "That bugger hanging out of Fattock's nose looks like a slug".. and it made her laugh. Just because you don't know what she's laughing at doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
Wondering why you are ignoring her and jacking with your phone instead. Laughing isn't always a good sign, some it's an early warning mechanism watch out
Probably an inside joke. Like, you think of a joke in your head.... OR, she's under the influence.
she prolly smoked crack
Depression is often a medical condition that responds to medical treatment. if you had a broken leg or an infection would you ask random idiots online "how to get rid of that?" No, you'd go to a doctor. Same with depression.
I've had it for over 40 years. You don't. You can take medications from the shrink; but the side-effects are nasty or they don't DO anything. And it's only a temporary fix.
Get to the bottom of your problems try to solve them even take profational help...it worth the money. Meanwhile occupy your self with things you can do like: do sport run or go to gym, painting, listen to music, read books, take a ride on bike etc...
I have I don't think it ever really goes away I quit doing hard drugs and changed a lot of my lifestyle choices and I'm a happier healthier person for it.
Please don't commit suicide There are times in life where u will feel alone,isolated,no one is there and that there is nothing worth living for but there is trust me There are 101 websites out there to help you Counsellors are all over the world for you to talk to And if you want to tell someone that this is what you are feeling and you just can't say it write a note PLEASE DONT DO IT hope everything goes ok and I hoped this helped There is light at the end of the tunnel
If you need help, reach out to a crisis hotline and speak with a crisis counselor. They can coach you through staying safe and how to get help from the people around you. If you are in immediate danger, call 911 or go to the ER. Take care and good luck, MH, counselor
The main problem is: it is difficult to search that someone. He is absconding. I am also searching for that someone. I have given a police complaint also.
You shouldn't kill yourself because the people around you suck. It seems like they're the problem. Or at least they've caused a lot of what you're going through. I'm sorry that your family seems to ignore you and think you're overreacting. They have no right to tell you how you feel. Neither do I. Your family shouldn't be a main reason for wanting to die, and I'm sorry that they are for you. I can't be hypocritical and tell you that you shouldn't try to kill yourself. All I can do is comment from miles away right. but hey, I care. I don't think you're overreacting. I'm nothing, but I believe in you
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
A lot of your "disorders" are cries for help and attention. I think it's clear that your mother doesn't care about you unfortunately. I think your best bet is to really just cut off from the family. Obviously you can't just move out,but you can start just sticking to yourself around your house,and try to go out as much as you can.
About twice. < M
It's big enough.
Approx. two inches...
5.6/4.8
Your penis size is completely and totally normal. That is perfectly fine and there is nothing to be concerned about. The length is normal and it will likely continue to grow until your early 20s! Don't think about that so much. Have fun, but be safe.
Yes you have a nice average size for an adult. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches and you could grow until your late teens to early twenties so your good.
Yeah. I mean you could probably have sex with it, if that's what you mean by O.K. < M
ok
Actually your penis is pretty large for your age. The average penis size for an adult is 4-6 inches. Your 14 and it's already 8 inches. You're body is still growing and will do so until your 21, so there is a good change you will gain a few more inches.
Yes, your penis is very good for your age or any age. It is a lot bigger than average.
Look mate, I can tell you're lying. I wasn't that big at your age but i am now. If you keep these lies you will grow smaller. ******* stupid You have a pinnochio dick
You mean 4 inches. You're measuring from the wrong end of the ruler kid.
Elephantine for 14. Are you measuring along the top. < M
Damned big son...call me when you turn 18
Very big, even for an adult!
Don't go making crap up, little boy.
Sorry, it's a myth. Only a few men grow much adter 18 at latest, it's really rare. Nothing you can eat or do can change your genes
You want to grow three inches. If you haven't grown in a few years, it means your growth plates have fused. In that case, done. You can ask your Dr. As far as what to do or eat, nothing.
It doesn't matter what you do. You stopped years ago. You heard wrong. Don't get scammed.
nothing you can do, dude. it's all in your genes.
If you were 18 you'd be the ideal girlfiend. (I'm 20. I'm not some middle-aged pervert.). Partly because of the getting high part. Just joking! I'm not. And the fact that you seem like a genuine person, and unlike most people in this world, you tell it how it is. Atleast you're sincere. You don't seem to hide behind some fake image.
you need to find a friend/good listener/professional who can help you rationalise what happened. while it is natural to harbour feelings of criminal intent, just think 'why should you serve time for killing a rapist when you are the victim?' There is a lot in your head that needs to come out and I would advise you find a way to get it out productively, so that when you do, you will feel better. I wish you well with this.
You are not crazy, but you have some psychological problems, you should go to psychiatrist, and talk with your parent. Have tell your parent and police that you were raped? Fufufu, that what normal people will say. You are not crazy, but you are a genius, gifted. Just like Moriarty from Sherlock Holmes, you need a rival or pale, challange. Thats what genius people are. -Tantei-sama
LOL. Either you are the most self aware person on the face of the planet..... or you are describing someone you know in an attempt to diagnose her with a personality disorder. I'm going with the latter.
Go to your GP about this
Just be patient. You'll know sometime within the next couple of years what your height is going to be.
No, likely about done growing in height given your age, and arm span has nothing to do with your final height. If you did grow taller likely your arms would continue to grow more too.
No. At 17 you stopped a couple of years ago.
How can anyone on here possibly know how tall you will be? We know absolutely nothing about you, or your genetics, medical history, living environment, health status, diet and exercise routine, sleep habits... Nothing.
Go slow and easy, focus on your own pleasures you are creating and don't watch porn when doing the deed. distracts from your sensations.
Use your hand
dont get caught
Use lotion
when do you consider that embryo to be human or a baby? even those that claim the right to abortions admit that at some point it is a baby and will no longer abort it. It is a life, so killing it is not the right of the mother since the right of the child is to live.
At the moment of conception there is a live human. All of the DNA is in place and the baby, however tiny and no matter his or her number of cells, is alive. A human's value is not measured in age or size, or even capacity. Life is precious no matter the age or stage. Pop culture seems to miss this, but life is precious and should be protected.
how can you say it is not human YET, it is human the moment the two cells join and all the dna of a human is present and it begins to form, do you say a baby is not an adult yet and therefore is not a protected life? If someone does not feed it and bathe it, it will die on it's own, but it is human http://liveactionnews.org/80771-2/ http://www.newkidscenter.com/Miscarriage... http://stillbirthday.com/gestational-age... look at the miscarried babies at 20 weeks, at 12 weeks - tell me those are not human! Those are the age of most abortions
remember dec 25th? that is not when Christ was born, that was the day the Word became flesh, when Christs mom became pregnant...the moment of conception is the moment life begins....not being a baby [ politically correct nonsense ] spun to talk people into murder being ok.....be smarter than the jerks who love telling lies and leading innocents into darkness....
It IS a Human Being.
Most of consider a fetus to be human.
I don't know the exact risks but it's best to check with a healthcare professional and have a test to not risk anything going wrong. You may be safer but it's better to check first

If he can go 10 minutes he's a freaking miracle worker. If a guy can last 5 minutes I consider it a very good night. That's why foreplay is so important to a girl. Guys can get it up, get it in, get it over with in five minutes or less. A girl needs a little more preparation than that, as you are probably aware of.
Normal sex act from penetration to ejaculation for males is about 4 minutes. Sounds like he is doing quite good, frankly. Can try desensitizing cream to see if that helps, or just have sex, then relax for 15-20 minutes, and go for round 2.
this normal dear , but maybe u both enjoying together which makes him so horney and then he c'um fast , for me i can last for 15 till 30mints and some times 1 depends on my girl , if she's wet or not and depends about position of course and for me missionary makes me last 30min and doggy sometimes makes me last more than 45mins so it depends about u and him and mode and sure position
5-20 minutes; experienced can last longer
Unless your bf is over 30 that is a long time. Maybe see if you can orgasm faster. < M
i always like to get it over with and go to sleep
It depends on the person generally when breasts stop growing but the average time is from 17-20 late teens to early young adult basically. As for you breast size I believe Ds are larger than normal but that's also at a normal weight. At 165 lbs your breasts might be slightly bigger because of that. I actually have a friend who is 17, 5'4 and around 160 lbs aswell. She tells me her boobs are bigger because she gained some weight.
Breasts continue to change size and shape throughout your life. Most breast development occurs in your pre-teens and teens due to puberty, and then into your early to mid twenties when fat distribution changes, even as a fully developed adult breast size can change with weight changes, hormonal changes, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. I'm not sure how you define 'normal size' and normal compared to what exactly, but there's really no such thing as abnormal size (unless you get to Lolo Ferrari size).
Breast can fluctuate in size throughout your lifetime. Factors like weight gain or weight loss, gravity, and age will change there size.
they grow till finishing the growth-phase towards the end of about the 16th life-year. 36D is already bigger than normal for a 5'4" lady, for now the D-cup is a good size but because of the 50lbs overweight in the ongoing growth-phase, they will grow overly and possibly be deformed.
I called the customer service number, I spoke to Andera. She was very informative and detailed about Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea , and several other of their products. She was very polite and pleasant to talk to. I received great customer service. Just give it some time to work, you will feel better and loose fat and weight in the process .
A low fat, low carb diet such as vegetables is a good start but unless you are trying to starve your body so it eats it's fat reserve (unhealthy) you need to make sure you are motivated to exercise because no food will burn fat while you do nothing.
It won't help you burn fat. But it does help you lose weight because vegetables have less calories.
You should eat fruit and also some kind of beans or meat to provide you all the nutrients you need. Really stay away from provessel foods and sugar.
In a way yes. Not in a very effective way though.
Cutting out carbohydrates will help more. No bread, pasta or pizza.
Yes,that may work.
Probably done, but 4/10 of an inch above adult average. Not small.
You are not on the small side. The average American male's schlong is only 1/4 inch longer than yours.
Nah fam you're ******
yup
If you really wanna lose that lower stomach fat. You'll probably want to complete stop drinking soda. You should try running. Run at least a mile each day and also do some core workouts like crunches, bicycle sit ups, planks, etc.. It would probably be a good idea to look up some core workouts on YouTube so they can show you exactly how to do them. Running should really help tho
Great excess weightloss supplement! I am now down 15 lbs over the last few months and nothing has changed other than adding these pills to mydiet. Very happy that there are 0 side effects other than shedding the pounds. I am stock piling WeightLoss GreenStore Tea so I never run out!
What you are talking about isn't fat, and it's not really something you can get rid of. If you can see your rips you might want to chill a little bit, because that's not usually healthy.
Cut the soda and do a lot of core strengthening like planks. Drink a lot of water with cucumber and lemon in it and cut out salt.
how about stop drinking the soda all together
I have same prob I found out by accident just one spoon of peanut butter and id forget to eat for like 4-6 hours id always skip a meal. who knows. might work for you. so NOT hungry with peanut butter. weird!!! never in my LIFE have I "forgotten" to eat.. I eat like every hour if I can...just non stop...but since ive had peanut butter.. I don't eat a meal.. and for long periods... so even though in itself peanut butter is not a diet food.. it IS when you find yourself eating way less calories overall
Take a serving size of a healthy snack, low sugar and calories, fruit and veggies are very healthy for loosing weight. Take your time to chew your food, count 15-20 seconds and then you can swallow. This will help you be satisfied with your amount of food. Good luck with your weight lose and remember to only lose weight that's nessacery! :-)
Eat smaller portions

No, you don't need to lose weight. So don't worry about it, just eat as much as you want. You're not obligated to be skinny.

It is to do with Puberty and penis growing, nothing to do with height. You are in a Growth spurt BTW. Usually foreskin will loosen up by itself by 17. You do not have phimosis in a medical sense, and you don't need a doctor. These guys are just selling circumcision. It is pretty normal for puberty. < M
It has to do woth your penis, you should be retracting it regularly and stretching it on the daily also. If you want to stay uncut that is. If it's no different to you just get cut. Out patient and you cango back to work the next day
is not related dear, and having a tight foreskin is normal for many men; my partner has it, and we enjoy a very good sex life, isn't a problem... it doesn't need to be retracted for sex. best regards xx
it has to do with the fact your not doing foreskin retraction two times a day like you should
Still developing- - matures between 15-17.
Like my older brother years ago, go to a doctor and let him circumcise you under anesthetic. You need it.
You may need to see a doctor if it is bothering you.

From what I read in your rant (not really a question here) you are nothing but a little 15 year old acting like a 5 year old. The Doctor is not your friend, they are your Doctor and the Doctor could see what you are. Time for you to grow up and act your age. (I see I make the baby asker mad from the quick thumb down now proving I am correct.))
Goshness, thats very unprofessional of the physician. i am glad you wrote to us here about it. Most insurers, perhaps all, will let you choose a different physician. I suggest visiting a different physician, just telephone the HMO (medical company) office and ask how to do that. They might have to ask your parents. To feel better and be weller though i mildly politely urge you to do all the things the current physician suggests.
People have started to worship doctor's and believe they are gods. Do to this fact doctor's now believe themselves to be gods and therefore abuse their power.
I live in the metro-Detroit area. If I get bit by a squirrel or a racoon, is there any disease or infection I could contract that a hospital could not deal with? Example: I get bit by a squirrel, go to a hospital and am told by the doctor I contracted Hellvirus and that I'll never be able to use my left arm again.
Raccoons can transmit rabies, which can be fatal if not treated quickly. A squirrel? Why would they even 'bight' you? Unless that's what it's called when you huff squirrel musk there on 5 Mile and Van Dyke.
Mmm. Yeh. Yep. Yep. The outlook isn't good for you at all. Here's what happened to the last person who got bit by a squirrel just the other day. They actually turned into an elephant for some weird, unexplained reason. It's a medical mystery:
No, nothing like that. Even rabies is extremely rare. It is not unusual for a person feeding squirrels to get nipped, if he coaxes the squirrel from his hand. Wild squirrels really don't know the difference between the food and the hand. A deep bite might need medical attention.
I once got bitten by a squirrel. I had a Tetanus injection. Unless it gets infected in which case you need antibiotics, you'll be fine.
I would see a clinic asap and tell them. Sure, tetanus and rabies are not that frequent, but the risk is not worth it.. They are painful and deadly diseases. And not pretty. Even if it's just a 1% chance, it isn't worth not getting a shot. Edit: and the booster shots will help you in the future anyways, we mostly all neglect them.
what's a bight?
Maybe rabies? But the doctor can probably cure that, so I don't think so
I don't think it is likely. But if you got bitten by either of those animals you might need to be treated for rabies.
I can not understand it. My balls smell like shrimp or lobster. I bathe most days but like today I scratched my balls and they smelled like lobster. I am not overweight but I do have a habit of urinating in cup while driving. My its my urinine splashing back up on me. Do you think when I shower perhaps I am not drying them enough.
I think your illness and or disease is real, as there is something off about driving while peeing in a cup. Perhaps therapy will help. The last thing you want is to have an accident with your zipper down and your penis hanging out with those smelly associates. Or, you can go to a dog groomer and get a blow dry.
Sounds like you need to quit peeing in a cup and see if that helps.

You will have to wait and see, as no one here knows what they will do. Every office and every patient is different, and what happened for one person could be very different than what will happen for you. They will most likely take an x-ray to determine if the baby teeth need to be removed, or if they can be left to fall out on their own. In the U.S., many young patients get braces while they still have baby teeth. The braces are not put on those teeth, but getting an early start with the adult teeth can often shorten the overall time that's necessary for braces to be worn.
I suggest consulting an orthodontist who will definitely not be putting braces on you for a second opinion. I am not an orthodontist but doubt if you should get braces if you still have baby teeth. MANY orthodontist and dentist offices are now owned by corporate interests that are far more interested in making money than they are in the well being of their patients. They commonly recommend procedures that have marginal, if any, benefit to the patient but allow them to profit from increased billing from those procedures.
consult with doctor
I traded that nonsense in for weed eight years ago. A month's supply of weed costs me less than smoking a pack a day of cigarettes for the month. And weed smells much better and actually gets me high.
Newport cigarette.
Newport and Marlboro cigarettes.

I've been having anxiety issues from my family, they've been really stressing me out and as a minor i can't do much to get away, i have no friends at all and i'm bipolar, i have anxiety issues and just in general a lot of heart problems, i'm a bit nervous that if she kicks me out and leaves me with my abusive and neglecting father that i might not survive this year..
Tell your dr. how you feel. There are good meds for anxiety. Report your abusive dad to Child Protective Services; they can get you into a good foster home. To find good friends, go to some big happy churches, attend groups there and have fun. Talk with the minister/pastor; where else can you get counseling for free?

I don't think so. Lobotomies have been the only treatment with positive outcomes, so no. I don't think so. You need a good plan to have a lobotomy paid for. Also, Obamacare plans don't want to cure liberalism nervosa.

It is a muscular contraction inside the abdomen that causes the semen to spurt out, and is activated when the body is aroused enough to climax and ejaculate.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme works great. Item received quickly. It takes awhile to work but it does work. Not for long but it's a start.

It's likely you've stopped. The vast majority of men stop getting taller by 16. Many before. You slow steadily before you stop so you fit the pattern perfectly. Nothing you can do. You're average. I never undersrand how you can do more than choose best answer for 10 points. How can you award 30? I'm not expecting g them as you won't like my answer even though it's the scientific facts.
you haven't stopped growing and when your done growing at the age of 21 you could be taller than all of them
It's quite possible that you are finished and it just as possible that you aren't. That said, you are in between your parents' heights. That's where most people end up. You aren't going to be much, if any, taller than your dad.
nope, again some years to grow
Yep, hope so. < M

Actually, artificial sweeteners are worse for you than regular soft drinks (and those are very bad for diabetics, too). The brain is wired to recognize the sweet taste of sugar and associate it with incoming calories it uses for fuel for the body. When you eat artificial sweeteners, the brain recognizes the sweet taste and readies itself to process the calories it thinks will follow. When no calories arrive, it activates the hunger response to get the "promised" calories from food. Thus, you end up eating more than you should, and this raises the blood sugar and is stored as fat. Ever wonder why obese people who drink diet soft drinks never seem to lose weight? This is why.
I am type 2 diabetic and doctor advised me not to drink it because of the atrificial sweeteners which react with diabetic medication - there is no harm having a glass maybe once a week
I'd assume not.
Drink up !
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It has no side affects. ------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
It isn't normal to think about it that often, get some sort of hobby, horse riding, art, music. Get your mind off these things
It is normal. For the majority of us anyway, and you'll eventually get use to it too as long as you fight against it and not let it in the way.
You are suicidal. Most people aren't. If you want to view that as abnormal, you are free to do so.
Welcome to life, it sucks! I feel it's the insane people who don't think about that inevitable black scary place we all go when we die. I mean, all you can do is accept it right? I wouldn't make it happen myself because it will happen already.
go get some marijuana with a friend sit down and relax to the butty of life.
I have been eating out a lot recenty, and have gained like 10-15 pounds. I didn't notice at first, but when I tried on my jeans, they couldn't get past my butt and thighs(not that they would have been able to buckle anyway). I have always been curvy, but I am worried now that I am just fat. weigh- 165 height-5 3 http://tinypic.com/r/4trsed/9
You're curvy, definitely not fat. You are actually quite beautiful. You have a fairly large butt, though. It depends on wether or not you like that in yourself.
There is no way for me that photo's were not there. Right now you should just enjoy being thankful God made you who you are. I might suggest you not post photo's online of yourself if you are not 18. That is child pornography, felony. Always be giving thanks for this day for it will never return yet your body has still many changes to go through.
165 lbs. on a 5'3" frame is significantly overweight -- not "curvy" or "chunky". Euphemisms for overweight do no one any good.
You look fine. Just like a lesbian girl. You would make a good GF for another lesbian. Don't try to hide it. Just tell your friends and they will understand. YOU GO GIRL.

If you have modern disposable lenses , there is no reason they can't be worn 16 hours a day or more. Most people do. Modern lenses are made for that . As long as your eyes are clear and not irritated after 12 hours, there is no reason to have to stop wearing them.
no one will care, few will probably even notice. FWIW, unless you are having eye problems already and this recommendation is from your doctor, get the extended wear contacts if you do not want to wear glasses. I know a lot of people who wear them ALL the time.
Get gas permeable lenses. They're fine.
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I had light acne scarring between my chin and neck area. I used a lotion called bevoline and it got rid of my acne scars as well as my acne. It comes in a gray and blue box not expensive at all. They are now also offering it on Amazon. I hope my answer helps. Good luck!

Honestly. You are not as gross as you think. You probably aren't gross at all. You are your own worst critic. Don't think that because you see yourself so negatively that others do as well.
To be quite honest, it sounds like there is rage, spite and hate oozing out of every sentence here. Have you ever considered that that might be what makes you "ugly" (if you are)? If you emanate something nice and warm, then it doesn't really matter with all those things on your list of complaints. :o)
Sounds like you need to go to a therapist, and yes am serious. You need to work on your self esteem, nothing else is going to make you feel good about yourself. Plenty of people go to therapists for that reason.
I'm sorry you feel bad about how you look. I know how hard it is when feel like you look bad. Just know that what you look like does not always effect how people feel about you.
Time to learn how to suck a good weiner... ya know, how fat, ugly chicks should.
I hate it. I hate it so much. I've had eczema since I was 10 and it has never been so bad right now. Painful itching everywhere. Before I had it in one patch on my arm, but now it's everywhere and I can't control it. Creams don't work, my steroid creams are finished and my parents are too busy with work so they don't have time to go to the doctors and get me some cream. My family members don't even care. I'm 14 now and I have never been so depressed in my entire life. I desperately want to die. I just want to end it all. Please help me.
Eczema is caused by your diet. Stop eating unhealthy crap. Then you won't have eczema, diabetes, erectile dysfunction (lady parts don't work either), suicidal thoughts, and a preggers belly when you arent with child.
Use Cetaphil Soap , my brothers got it occasionally and they always tried to scratch at it and now its not a problem. I have really bad skin as well and I'm your age , life sucks but theres so much to live for and see in this world. Don't harm yourself over something that your body is going to eventually get rid of sooner or later. If you ever need some confidence watch InfiniteWaters on Youtube. He's a cool guy and watching him takes your mind of all the negativity in your life .
Try Betnovate. Apply SPARINGLY to the affected skin once or twice a day. Before and after applying the ointment, DO NOT peel off flakes, no matter how loose they are. Leaving flakes intact will hasten healing. Give Betnovate 30 minutes or so to absorb into your skin, then apply E45 lotion. At regular intervals throughout the day, keep applying E45. If you don't like E45, there is Boots' Derma Care Light Daily Moisturising Lotion.
This is terrible. Plead with them. Have they ever had poisin oak ot ivy. That should get them to relate. Can u go to pharmacy and pick it up if they give u the money?
Do not bathe or shower using hot water. Use warm water at the most.
Two things to make you think a little differently: 1) So if your mother had had an A-cup, then you would have been perfectly satisfied with Bs? 2) You say you think about it all the time as if it was a law of nature. But do you know that you yourself have a CHOICE what you think about? PS: I am indeed trying to be helpful ... although my wife's breasts were about 5-10% of yours in size when she was 18, so I am perhaps also a bit like; "Are you by any chance a over-over-stressed about this?"
I have long hairs on certain parts of my body and if i take tweezers and get them out and then squeeze the skin pus comes out. I also have these hard tiny seed like things that come out of the backs of my thighs and cause really painful bumps, i don't think they are ingown hairs. I have red dots all over my legs, arms, back, and parts of my chest. They are tiny on my chest, small on back and arms, but my legs look awful. Anyone know why my skin is so messed up? Thanks in advance!!
Yep
yes
Your body can not eliminate all the chemicals you are exposed to so now they are storing in your cells. We are exposed to way more chemicals then we realize.
You need to eat very healthy food and get lots of exercise. Everyday eat a healthy diet of fruit, veggies, a few nuts, lean meat and fish, whole grain breads and cereals, low fat dairy products.
Make your meal portions smaller. Eat more vegetables. Exercise at lease twenty minutes a day.
work out, eat healthy, don't become anorexic and be happy with yourself
running
sports
jerk off more
Us the start and stop method- when feeling close to climax, stop stimulation for a bit then resume to delay the climax from happening. Many guys have trained their gear to respond quickly by hand and that does notwork well when having sex with a girl. So practice delaying ejaculation as much as you can.
Edging is probably the best thing you can do. If edging doesn't help, you should try to enjoy the way you are.
Use plenty of lubrication and stroke lightly as well as stopping from time to time when you feel yourself getting close.
i cant wait to cu mm
relax and edge
Practice... duh!
So recently I have gained 10 pounds due to eating out nearly every meal. My bf told me the other day that he wants me to lose the 10 pounds I gained. Im 5'4 and now weigh 130. Last night he came over saw that I bought chocolate muffins and was like thats not diet food throw them out. He then went thru my pantry and didn't like what he saw. He's starting to become obsessive about it and its making me feel bad about myself. Do you think Im over reacting and should lose the weight or are my feelings warranted?
You should not let him treat you like that! If he doesn't like your body, then he can go and you can find someone who will. Your BF is an idiot, who apparently only care about his GF's weight. Don't worry about that jerk and tell him that if he can't accept you...then he should leave. Your weight doesn't matter and you should only loose weight when you want to, not when you BF do. I think your BF should become your ex. Good luck!
Always skeptical when buying these things, there are so much choices out there. I went for this based on reviews. Love this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product ! It tastes good, I could drink it everyday. It does make you feel full. Its has help to curb my appetite, WOW! Lost some pounds and totally happy!
If you want to lose the weight for yourself, than do it. If not, then he's not the right boyfriend for you.
And why are you still dating this individual? You're not going to marry this guy. In one year you two will be broken up. You're not going to be together in the long term. You'll forget his name one day. This guy is not important - I promise.
There's nothing wrong with you. You're actually in the normal weight range.
Your feelings are completely warranted and I'd be a single girl if I were in your position. Anyone that is making you feel bad about yourself doesn't need to be in your life.
Your weight your body, nobody should have influence over that. If you're comfy with it, that's all that matters. Try get that across to him, if that doesn't change anything, you might want to rethink what sort of attraction he has for you and what type you want.
I think you could lose about 175 lbs really easily, you need to lose him and his crappy attitude.
No other symptoms it just feels like maybe i pulled a muscle or something its in the center of my chest and it does increase when i breath or move my chest area i did wrench on cars friday amd saturday i just wish there was a better way to tell at home if it was heart attack or something else. I was told heart attacks usually happen immediately and not last all day please help
My husband had this same pain last week after doing some streneous outdoor work. I think he just pulled a muscle. A heart attack would be move severe. Rest a while and if it persist or gets worse, then seek help.
Hah no you don't have a heart attack. If you did it would probably be the longest in human history. Their are a lot of muscle around their you probably just strained something!
Sigh.....if you're 65, it COULD Be a heart attack, but if you're 15, it's 100% guaranteed not to be one. Pure imagination.
If you were having a heart attack you wouldn't be on here asking a question. Enough said.
You can quit anytime you want, the two week notice thing is mostly to get a good reference and a chance of being rehired. If you think you need them for a future reference or may want to work there again, you might just want to stick with the two week notice, people give those notices so they don't burn bridges.
Once you give your two week notice, you're giving them a warning that you're leaving in two weeks. Once two weeks have passed you should be free to leave. If they keep on giving you hours after you were supposed to quit, that's their error. If it were me I would confirm whether or not they recieved the notice, though.
Quit . That is ridiculous. They did this to my kid when she was in school and working another job around Christmas time. She said she had to have the time for studying and they bumped her hours so she gave notice and then talked to the manager and went home when they didn't change the scedule . It was their loss and not hers. Take care of yourself. Your emploryers won't.
Leave when those 2 weeks are up (that you gave your notice for). That's how it's usually done, but then again, since you already have another job, just go. Tell them first, of course.
nothing to stop you advising them you wont be turning up again some employers try to pretend they can withhold wages owed but thats nonsense except in particular contractual circumstances
Here every thing depends on your present "mental health" condition. I can answer only if you give me some background for this story.
First things first! Find a willing large woman and go from there.
It's enough.
Large size of woman does not matter. Whole is similar in all
Try this method- works for guys who take anti-depressants that make it hard to release, so may work for you. When you are ready to ejaculate, use your groin muscles to repeatedly lift and tighten up your scrotum. Kinda awkward to do but can be done, and easy once you get the right contraction. Keep doing it and it will generally kick off the male climax and cause you to ejaculate.
Well, I had this problem for a bit. What you do is when you feel like you are at your climax, go harder. Don't check to see if you ejaculated, but just keep going until you can't go any faster/harder. Go as long as you can, and that should work. Don't mean to be corny, but give it 110%!
If you're relatively early in puberty, you may not have reached that point, yet. Most guys will experience a wet dream or two as a precursor, then any time from there on in, for real. Generally speaking, the first few times aren't much to write home about, as it takes a while for volume to build. Be patient. Practice different techniques.
you cant ejaculate if you are 10 years old
If your an adult male who has touble ejaculating you should do porn cause you got free stamina.
Ask your parents to tell them. Or ask to speak to the counselor before school and the counselor will help you do it.
Ask them to step outside the classroom when you tell them
Just tell them that you had an asthma attack :/ I apologise if I misunderstoof the question at all btw
Ask your mother to write a note explaining to them what happened.
Just be honest with them
Why do you have to tell your teachers...it happened after school.
Yes. Understand that the makers of processed foods, their first concern is profit and not your health. MSG causes cancer but it's used because it makes the food taste better. The preservatives used in deli meats. bacon etc (Sodium Nitrite and others) are carcinogens. Very little information is given in regard to cancer prevention. Why? Because the present cancer medical system is funded by a steady stream of people needing treatment. Sad but true.
It will make you healthier overall but is not a specific treatment for cancer.
Yes.
No
Maybe, could, might.
yes! i just got mine tightened yesterday. It hurts to eat a cookie. But if you're getting your braces tightened for the first time it won't hurt as bad yet. The first few times i didn't feel a difference when they tightened but i have had them on now for 5 months now and this is the first time they actually hurt.
Yes it does hurt a bit.
Yes but taking asprin will help
yes
I DON'T KNOW.
thats what everyone says
it won't if your relaxed
It's not urine you consume, but specific elements of it. You go ahead and drink all you want. I'll stick with ice tea, thank you very much.
No, it's completely healthy. It's called Urophagia and it's actually quite good for you.
Yeah its sweet
Not a normal thing to do.
Cures diabetes is the rumor.
Vaginas expand to enormous sizes . They can push a baby out and think of the size of that head. Some women may have defects and need medical attention. Do not have sex before you want to have sex. It should not hurt unless he doesn't take his time. Use lots of lubrication but really if you are afraid or bored, do not have sex with this kid.
hunzo no issue it streches like an elastic band
It will expand. Once his prick starts poking around, your ******** will just suck it up.
12 year old boys don't have vagina's.....do you?
The average penis size for a 14 year old is 4 inches. So you have a very nice penis at 6 inches.
Above average adult size. By an inch. Well hung, be proud.
This Prolargentsize product is wonderful, I implore whoever that is willing to give it a trial to go ahead. Quite and perfectly sure that a trial will convince you. Thumb up cheers .......!!!
it's above average for your age
You have a nice big dick. Large/average for an adult.
So like my vagjna has been getting a lot wet than usual for the past couple of months. It wasn't like this before and it's really uncomfortable because there are times when I don't use underwear so it gets on my pants. My boyfriend said I'm fine but it's still weird to me. It gets on my pants and underwear. So is this normal or do I need to go to the doctor?
Determine if it's discharge or arousal fluid. If it's discharge, talk to your doctor. If it's arousal fluid (an absurd amount) talk to your doctor.
your vagina, is a self cleaning oven, 24/7 and it don't ask permission to clean itself either.....figure it out.
Pretty normal. Be glad you can get wet easy. It makes for easier sex.
it's your vagjna self cleaning itself
Can't help you with that, best advise is to go to doctor, good luck.
good for you. its normal. its fine to have it go everywhere. keep wearing no panties. wear skirts without panties and you wont get it on your pants. you can eat the discharge too. it tastes amazing
I'm around 310 lbs (yes I know I'm fat don't need any insults ) and I have been eating a lot better and have slowly started to work out but after I lost 10lbs I have slowly started to gain it back. I haven't changed anything since I lost the weight so I don't know what's causing this. Positive answers please
You may be eating well, but how much are you eating? By eating well, you should eat three balanced, preferably homemade meals a day. Also, don't eat too much...... For example, if you eat a sandwich and you are still hungry, don't eat another sandwich with chips or something. Resist and be sure to drink plenty of water, but not too much or you'll flood out your body. Keep up the exercise as well. I've found that running is very good. Good luck! You can do it!
Maybe you aren't eating enough? Really eating too much? Maybe it is water weight from having lots of sodium filled things/salt. Have you been taking before/after pictures? Taking measurements or going by what the scale says? Logging everything on mfp or other sites? Do you use a food scale? Drink more water. Also if you just started an exercise program (weight training etc) then your body can go up in pounds a bit and then even out again.
Well muscle is smaller/more compact than fat. This means that a person with 30 lbs of muscle will look thinner than a person with 30 lbs of fat, assuming both weigh the EXACT same, There are pictures on google about this. So you since you're working out, you could actually be building muscle. A way to help measure progress with this knowledge in mind is to use a tape measure around your waist. If it's shrinking but you're still gaining weight, that is good
Watch your caloric intake too. You need to eat less cals than you burn. Also it is normal to gain weight first starting to work out because that weight is just muscle. So if you really are following the caloric rule then that weight is probably muscle or water weight drinking lots of water from working out which is good, wouldn't worry about it. Drink green tea :). There are also detox teas that help with weight loss tinytea is really good it helped my bloating and skin, good for other things besides losing weight. Just cleanses your body
I have a really weird addiction ive been doing since i was 8. I like to sniff sleeping puppies. I dont know why but when i see them sleeping, i like to sniff because they are SO U CUTE! Ill cuddle them and just stary sniffing their necks or back. They dont seem to care some actually like it. Should i stop and get help?
Nah
nah keep sniffing the sleeping puppies. but you might smell like dog so go shower
um... that's not really weird or an addiction, unless like, you're running home from school during class to get a sniff of the stuff. plus, a lot of people like the smell of animals, personally, I like the smell of the zoo, idk why but it makes me feel wild and calm and like, idk it's hard to explain.
They tend to reproduce more because they and the girls they have sex with unfortunately use less birth control methods-- well documented that the birth rate is higher among inner city blacks due to that fact. White males and females are more likely to use some form of birth control.
Stereotypes
nope, it's your impression...
why do you say this? .
Don't be! Stretch marks are perfectly normal. They are caused by growth, resulting in skin stretching. This can be by natural growth, building muscle or weight gain. For me, Bio-Oil is the best thing for stretch marks. You can pick this up relatively cheap at any drug store. Remember, they will go with time! You're beautiful no matter what.
That is totally normal. It means that you could have gained or lost weight to fast. There are some creams for stretch marks that you can get over the counter, but you have to be patient with them because they dont work right away.
Most teen girls have stretch marks from growing.
Don't worry u beautiful:)
You do need to speak to your doctor about the issues with your penis... the pain, excessive curvature, skin adhesions, etc. But you don't necessarily have to tell him that you masturbate, you can if you want to or think that him knowing may somehow help, but rest assured he already knows that you masturbate simply because you're a 15 year old.
He knows you masturbate- you are a 15 yr old male.
Its great actually, you dont like to have big d!ck?, youre 12 and youre having puberty and this time your body is changing. But thatl will fade ones you passed puberty.
Puberty.
Puberty. It is getting bigger so you can stretch open a girl's vagina. You are in for some fun.
Same reason your hands and feet are growing = Puberty. Your head is also growing. < M
Maybe it's puberty. Seems possible. Consider it.
Dont complain just be glad its growing

You would have probably noticed a stroke - They tend to get your attention. There's also Bell's Palsy which can do that, but there's nothing you can do about that, either... But, nature doesn't do 'perfect' - Nobody on earth is exactly the same, side-to-side. Everybody has slight differences. One of my ears is a touch higher then the other, but I don't notice it until I get new glasses & they need to be tweaked. No big deal...
I've had several strokes and my face and my mouth are not droopy.
It can vary. There are other reasons for one side of your mouth to droop. Bell's Palsy is most likely. Call your doctor.
see a doctor
So I'm 15 years old and my clit area is so uncomfortable that it hurts its comes every one day and after peeing it burns, i always wear cotton underwears and ive never had Intercourse or ever been touched by anybody other than me and i have no idea why its hurts. And i drink a lot of water too so i hope that scratches some diseases
too much pressure or rubbing can make it sore, if it always hurts to pee and you can fell your bladder is uncomfortable you may have a UTI, if just the clit hurts try leaving it alone for a while and wear loose clothes so the skin can heal
I would check it out with the doctor.
Like most infections anywhere, your body may be able to fight it by itself. However, it may only clear up with proper prescribed medication - or will be very slow to clear without medication. Since your genitals are so vital to you it is always best to see a doctor if you have anything wrong with them.
Depends on were on the penis it is and how you treat it. If it is on the shaft somewhere, apply antibiotic ointment. If it is a urinary infection, in your urethra, or further inside, that is hard to get rid of and usually requires antibiotics.
Sometimes. Depends WHAT infection, dunnit. < M
often, but not always, and in the meantime it could make damnages. see a doctor if it lasts too much
not likely
Sleepy.
I feel good! I also feel content, loving and occasionally sleepy... or at the very least "groggy". But I do recover to my usual self rather quickly and my interest for another round increases.

I think you should go. It may feel embarrassing with a broken tooth, but just remember that it will be fixed soon and if anyone asks about it, answer them with a truthful response and tell them youre getting it fixed soon. You will regret it later on in life if you dont go to your 6th grade ceremony, believe me. Best of luck, and have fun! xx
I would go to your 6th grade ceremony. you only graduate 6th grade one time only.
I'm sorry for the bad timing, I can imagine it would be embarrassing. Here's the thing however.......................It's a celebratory time and others will not only be in a good mood and happy for you they will also kind of feel bad. Not like you did something stupid it's just that the side of your tooth happened to break. Also remember these things are more noticeable to those that it happened to then others.
If you're okay with going go! I'd say go ignore people they're immature!
Go but try not to smile, good luck
go just have a ready joke about the tooth. . .like you should see the other guy. go enjoy yourself and get it fixed when you can.
Go. Probably no one will notice, and if they do,.... so what?
Aaaaaannnnd we have here another stupid kid who was drunk all through biology class and doesn't understand the first thing about how living organisms work. Congratulations. No, of course you can't "generate" a disease like that. But that's not a license to have unprotected sex just because you THINK that neither person is infected. You never know whether you're infected. Use a condom.
Someone needs to be infected first in order for the dissease to be passed along. STD stands for Sexualy transmited Dissease, If neither had anything before, none will have anything now
It can't be 'generated' by anything. STDS are passed from someone who has an STD to someone who doesn't.

She sounds like a pedophile. A 25 year old shouldn't be in any relationship with a 16 year old, let alone anything sexual! So just stop what you're doing right now. If she starts peer pressuring you into doing it with her, this may become rape at which case you should call the police. Update: That prooves my point. She is a pedophile, trying to turn on a guy far too young! As I said before, call the police as this sounds like rape.
No one here can tell you if she has a venereal disease or not, but if you are saying she has had sex with a lot of guys the probability is much greater. Don't do something you will regret for the rest of your life. Here is a helpful article: https://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/fa...
Why do people keep posting stories of their imaginary sex life in the politics section?
She will end up in jail. You will end up emotionally broken. Find someone your own age.
If it is painful you are doing it wrong.

Hello everybody. I'm a 15 year old girl and I am a freshman in high school. I have ADHD, Autism, Aspergers, ODD, Tourette's, Major Depression, Anxiety, etc. anyway I'm having some issues in school I just really don't wanna go at all! I am on meds for depression. My mom won't homeschool me. How can I survive 3 more years? It's very difficult.
Don't let those things take control of your life! I know it really hard but hang in there! maybe try speaking with your teachers to see if they can make you feel more comfortable. Maybe independent studies? its a better form of home school you just meet with a teacher once a week I believe.

I'm a 42ddd weighing 194. I am only 5 foot 1. I hate having large breasts. I'm still a virgin. I have never even had a first kiss. Back when I weighed 140 I had a 34ddd. I look so ugly. How much weight should I lose to be able to wear a bikini top or normal clothes? Will I look uneven at 115? I have struggled with my weight for so long.
It sounds as though you have been given a gorgeous figure that others would wish they had!!! Proper diet and exercise is necessary for excess weight, as you know, and the chest size will go down in proportion to this. But please know . . . so many women WISH they had your size bust, it's really something to appreciate. Your future husband will cherish and appreciate them, and if you nurse babies Mommy will be so cuddly! :-) In the mean time, you can wear a minimizer bra if you like. The brand Glamorise (spelled with an s) has some amazing minimizers. Particularly their sports minimizer bras. You can find them on eBay!
I think you would look great in a bikini top now. Im 44ee and wear a bikini
Not really, most guys are somewhat proportionate, in that a guy who is big physically will tend to have bigger gear than a smaller built guy. Sure some guys that are smaller will be hung like a mule but not as common.
No, but they tend to happen at the same time due to increased testosterone.
No one thing has nothing to do with the other.
no it can't

At my job I don't like talking to the guys there like they'll try to talk to me but I won't put to much into the conversation I only like talking to the women there especially the ones I find attractive l also like flirting with the women but I ignore the women I dont find attractive I wish I was the only guy that worked there
Horrible person? No. Selfish? Yes. You need to learn to get along with EVERYONE and not just the people you want to hit on or date. Which by the way it's NEVER a good idea to date a co-worker or flirt with them this day in age because they can hit you with a sexual harassment suit and you'll end up without a job. Be nice to everyone on the job, say hello, and make office small talk. Stay away from gossiping, and stay out of conversations that are not your business.
I wouldn't say you are a horrible person; however, I would say that flirting with coworkers is not appropriate in most business settings and may be seen as sexual harassment if the flirting is too much
1) No one knows. (A doctor, specialized in urology, will only be able to make a vague guess). 2) No. What could hurt your partner is the girth. But you don't give specifics about this. 3) No, in a couple of years you'll be glad to be above average. 4) I'm certain you are indeed above average. The exact average is a scientifically difficult thing to measure because you can't force guys to show you their erect penis and you can't trust guys to be honest about it. Most research will tell you that the average penis (erect) is 13-16 cm. GL!
1. Possibly. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. Some boy speak early, you may have already. 2. Not likely 3. No 4. The average for 14 is around four inches. Because most of the penis growth usually takes place between age 14 and 16. But again it's likely you've already peaked.
You are perfectly normal. Your worries are silly. That is written in a very polite way... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Yes it's just body hair. You can shave your legs and underarms but I wouldn't suggest anywhere else.
It's hereditary, & yep, perfectly natural & normal.
thats normal,taning your body and waxing helps

Im asian. I find that I eat small amount of food that have meat that are not too oily(Fish) with simple grains(Anytime of rice) and vegetables(Any type). Drinking water or tea. Stay away from processed foods and sugary stuff. But in reality i think we just have really high metabolism.
Intention to stay thin throughout life.
Because most of them don't adopt the crappy western diet the rest of us have. They eat better by default.
Because of what they eat
They don't eat much meat.
Hi, I have an uncircumcised penis. I wanted to know, that when I have an errection, is my foreskin supposed to go behind the head of my penis automatically when I have an errection? Because currently nothing happens when I have an erection; my whole penis is still covered with my foreskin. Also when I will have sex in the future will I have to pull my foreskin back behind the head of my penis and then put a condom on? What do I do if it hurts to pull it back past the head? I don't have an issue masturbating and it's fairly easy to clean.
Either or is considered normal. Some guys have really long for skins that never get retracted when they are erect. Others just the opposite. As long as you were pulling your foreskin back manually and washing under there very well at least once a day, then you'll be good.
I am uncircumcised, and my foreskin has always stretched with erection, and my glans is fully exposed. I consider that normal, and if you can pull the foreskin back by hand when masturbating, exposing the glans, fully, you are fine. It will do the same during intercourse, or when she gives you oral.
You seem to have a slight case of phimosis. Their are many solutions (operative and non-operative) or you could just leave it alone. Make an appointment with a urologist.
Im 15 and a vergin and every now and then some clear sometimes white stuff come out my vagina at such random times. its been a few years now and it hasn't stopped b4 i had my period for the first time and almost every day it happens. i haven't talked to anyone about it cuz thats embarrassing. but whats wrong with me, am i sick? is it normal? what do i do to make it stop if its a problem. what is it and why does it happen???
Okay I don't know what the last person who answered was on, but this is normal! And you definitely shouldn't eat it, they're a troll. Discharge comes out of your vagina and its basically just your vagina naturally cleaning itself. Buy some pantyliners so it doesn't ruin your panties or anything and you'll be fine. It's nothing to worry about and it happens to everyone with a vagina.
It's normal discharge fluids working their way out. They can vary in color at times and also contain old blood that was trapped in your system
its normal. NEVER wear pantyliners. you should start eating the discharge. it tastes AMAZING. try it. to make it stop you eat it
A bag is considered essential by anyone who does boxing or martial arts. If you want to keep your form, just shadow box until you heal. Plenty of good videos around to show the best moves. If the pain persists, you should probably get checked out, as it is not that hard to break bones in your hand, especially if you do not wear gloves.
NEVER punch a punching bag with bare hands
Call 911 and say you murdered a punching bag.
Probably not punch the bag anymore until you heal and can afford to buy gloves.
Punch a rock. Then you will wish you could punch a punching bag instead...
Punch yourself in the bag
Gloves man... If you can't move your fingers or they look broken, go to the ER right away. Swelling is normal even if they aren't broken. When in doubt, seek a doctor out
RICE R- rest I- Ice C- compression E- elevate However if it doesn't heal by like 2 weeks maybe get it checked out by a doctor
Learn how to punch.
Go to the hospital and get an x-Ray done, in case you hurt your bone or muscles.
Hello, I have a friend who 'likes me' but he gets mad over the slightest things. If I don't respond to text quickly or hang with friends or no phone. He will go flip and call me a ****, whore, *****, ect. He won't tell me. He said it's an anger related disordered and not bipolar. I like him as well, but I need help understanding what he has. Any idea?
It's called Raging A$$hole.
He's right, it's NOT Bipolar. Could be an issue with anger management, could be Intermittent Explosive Disorder. Could be that he's just an *******.....
He's an abuser who makes himself feel better by manipulating you. You should stop being his friend. You can't change or help a person like this. Their change can only come from within.
He comes from an abusive family where he learned these ugly traits. He was abused as a little kid - and I'd imagine he's in deep denial about it. Now he's handing the abuse on to you. So get the hell away from the guy and don't deal with people like this. They're sick people.
As a person who's had issues with eating (was never taken to be diagnosed but I've had symptoms of an eating disorder), I know how you feel :D I'm really glad food tastes good again and I hope you keep it up ♡
Make sure you are eating well. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...

yes that's a nice healthy breakfast! Glad you're recovering :D

Ok?
No I am too. I'm a 26 year old virgin and I'm desperate for sex. I stare at women where I work constantly while gritting my teeth and making a demonic looking face. I am constantly getting hard ons and my shaft bends awkwardly in my underwear and I have to adjust it.
Yes, you're the only human in the world who's always horny.
You must be a young man , women are NEVER like this ,if they claim to be then they are lying to gain power over a man. Good news , it fades with age. The world needs an effective male libido killer that has no adverse side effects to even the playing field & bring the far higher male libido into line with the typically disinterested female.
I think it isn't normal to be constantly horns 24/7
If you always think about sex then you will always be horny . And I'm sure at young age when your sex organ grows you get more horny . If you dont like it , try engage into a sport that will take your mind of it.
Were the same bro, i guess its normal btw im 18yo so its our body telling us what to do, its an urge and i admit i cant help myself but go deal with it in safest way, i masturbate and it relieves me and its the safest way possible... I guess itll subside in some point. You dont have to worry about being horny just dont be aggressive to someone that it hurts your or him/her, some of the talks should be shared to your friends about this, or you make yourself more productive, do some sports, or just have some fun with it. Youre a human and you are supposed to feel this, its what we become us...
No, you're not the only one.
Only one typing on your keyboard. All the other guys your age and older are doing the same. Every guy is horny all the time once he starts puberty.
I doubt that you're the only horndog out there.
I'm constantly horny every time I am around my husband.
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I had light acne scarring between my chin and neck area. I used a lotion called bevoline and it got rid of my acne scars as well as my acne. It comes in a gey and blue box not expensive at all.
Just leave it alone and don't pick at it. That's the only way.
First you should cùm on it but it takes so many times, so just burn it.
Depends on the individual and how long his individual penis is. They do vary in size, certainly a 23 yr old is a grown man and his penis has probably been the same size since at least 15. Average adult erect size is 5.16 inches, bigger guys physically tend to be bigger down below, smaller guys smaller. Usually somewhat proportionate.
The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches for an adult.
The same size it was when you turn 16. The penis does not continue growing after genitalia reaches its maturity, by age 15 or 16.
about as long as when you were 22
How tight is a 23 year old woman's vagina?

This woman asked me for sex, she's 25 y.o, and I'm a 16 y.o boy, she's saying I'm ready because 16 y.o is okay, anyway, she did have sex with alot of guys, but I never had sex before, it's not rape, it's about HEALTH, will sex affect my health?? will my penis hurts, or when i pee?? she told me to go to her house, right now?? Is it okay? For my health?? I need fast answer before i go to her house?
No sex will not make your penis hurt, not even the first time. However I question what kind of a 25 yr old woman tells a 16 yr old to come over to her house for sex. 1- she is a total slut and could very easily have an STD. Wear a condom if you do this!!!! 2- this is a set up to get you to the house for bad, bad reasons! there are evil people out there who kidnap, hurt or even kill young people. It happens!!! For real!!
Stop posting that same phony question kid. It's obvious No One Believes you
the guy I had sex with was 14 and it didn't hurt his but he had to take a sh*t but didn't make it to the toilet lol!
Maybe try to stop thinking of food as good or bad. It's fuel for your body. I find that if I eat more at breakfast, I'm less likely to be hungry later at night. Instead of skimping on calories early, I eat eggs and avocado toast and maybe some berries or oatmeal if I'm really hungry. Then later at night I can have a cup of herbal tea after dinner and not be hungry.
Yeah sometimes if you're craving sugary food, you're just low in sugar, and should eat some fruit. Same with fats and protein, just opt for a healthier choice.
Try eating apples and peanut butter at night (if you're not allergic) it might calm your cravings and it's not too bad for you. Or allow yourself to eat some of the bad food, but slowly wean off of it.

In our pediatric oncology center, we often use Dory's motto (from Finding Nemo)- "just keep swimming." The kids can relate to it. And our big kids get motivation from the little kids. There's nothing like seeing a two year old go through treatment to show you that you can do it. Andrew McMahon (current radio hit is Cecilia and the Satellites) underwent treatment for leukemia when he was fronting the band Jack's Mannequin. During that time, he wrote a song called Swim. He also produced a documentary about his illness and treatment. There's a line from the song that stands out, especially after 30 treatments- "you haven't come this far just to fall off the earth." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA8PaIw5...
I'm on 4 years, 3 months, 3 weeks and 3 days of non-stop treatment for metastatic breast cancer. That's 1,576 days. That's NINE (9) different treatment protocols (including five different chemotherapy drugs) as well as 69 days of radiation treatments. Do I think it's worth it? Absolutely!!!!! I will keep throwing everything I've got at this disease until there is nothing left to throw. And then I will die of this disease. You don't think your treatments are worth it? Don't come whining here. You find what it means to be alive and go from there.
Watch a series at YouTube called, 'The Truth about Cancer'. Even Stage 4 does not have to be a death sentence. Suzanne Somers who is a cancer survivor wrote a book called, 'Knockout', by all means read it.
I'm so sorry you are suffering, i wish you well on recovering....[ I'm not a fan of chemotherapy at all ] well most of the info is purged by now, but the rockeleffers used the sell kerosene to fight cancer, but they dropped it in favor of the more lucrative chemotherapy...the love of money and all that.....really torques me off....anyways if your curiosity is up, do your own search to find it [ kerosene, cancer ] you'll find a bunch of articles on it......I don't expect you to do anything, but I do hope you get educated....hope you are taking vitamins and minerals too....
"This is my fight song" by Rachel Platten helps me. Also "The Dance" by Garth Brooks. My husband suggest Katy Perry's "Roar" Several Christian songs for me as well. "Bless the Lord Oh my Soul" is one, with a personal connection. I sang it to my MIL when she was sick. You have my empathy. I've only done two chemos and so far the effects have been manageable.

Im a 15 year old girl who weighs 80kgs. I've been wanting to lose weight for 5 years now and well it's reached a point which I have to do something, not only because of the way I look but because of my health. I am never motivated however. My love for food always gets in the way. I know its all in my head but I cant help it. Please someone help.
You'll have to go on a diet and do some exercise! It's best not to count calories as it can lead to some horrible mindsets and behaviours which can ruin your life so avoid that if possible! Try by decreasing or swapping foods your already eating, say if your having a couple of pieces of buttered toast for breakfast, why not have one piece and some fruit instead? Say if your going to have pizza for dinner, why not make your own on some wholemeal tortillas? Still have snacks you like from time to time but not everyday maybe. As for exercise running is always good, 20-30 mins a day or every other day would be great!
I started taking Weight Loss Green Store Tea 8 days ago and I have already lost 4 lbs! I have altered my eating habits but not drastically. If you are serious about losing weight this is an amazing product to kick start you. I have had no side effects once so ever I absolutely love these I already ordered my second bottle!
Let us do it this way: 1. take an apple after cleaning the teeth. 2. Do sqauts 3 x 20. But first you have to go for one set. You may learn from youtube or go to gym. The fitness has to be done in gym or you have to walk one hour per day beginning from 30 min and increase to 60 min in one month time. 3. Must do abs. 4. should not take more than 1300 cals full day. This will bring down your weight. 5 days a week pl
Obviously diet and exercise are the only real answer. Try to find some healthy snacks you like. I know it's not the same as cookies and chocolate, but if you can distract yourself with melon or kiwi or something that might help. Maybe find a part time job after school so you're too busy to think about food too much?
The only way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise.

You could easily get meth from the internet. But there's no way it will help your ADHD. And your doctor will get arrested for prescribing you meth. Nothing about your question makes sense, if we're being honest here.
I am sure that meth would make it far worse . You have a better shot at getting marijuana .
get out of bed and get some food it's not gonna come to you
Get UP and go get some food, do you want to pass out?
stay hungry if you order a pizza are you going to be able to answer the door ? This way you won't need to go to the toilet

What is a therapist, exactly? I live in the UK and we don't use this term. What is the UK equivalent? I already have people working with me for other mental health issues, but I don't feel comfortable talking to them about this. I don't feel comfortable talking to anyone, which is why I posted it anonymously. To be honest I don't see how a therapist would help since this doesn't really tie into any mental health problems. I'm not eating cookies because I'm depressed or anything like that.
I have a food addiction as well. I just talked to my mom about it and she came up with healthy coping strategies for when I get a craving. Whenever I get a carving, I take a walk. I do something else. I distract myself until the hunger goes away. Your situation seems a little bit more severe, so i sugegest seeing a therapist if this doesnt work. Good luck!
Maybe ask whoever is buying them to stop if you do not have the item available to consume how can you eat them. The reality is willpower maybe if you started looking at cookies like they are making your butt bigger or your having to buy bigger clothes this may help you from eating them.
than your not addicted to cookies
Do not use any form of oil or grease. Buy a proper water soluble lube such as KYJelly. This is readily available on the open shelves of any good pharmacy and is not age restricted.
Astroglide works well or KY. Washes off easily and doesn't stain. A little goes a long way and not too expensive.
None is needed you can rub your penis against your bed or a pillow. More messy this way so have an old rag or towel handy
Generally for solo sex, none is needed if you know how to do it properly. Just don't create friction. Best lubes are the ones designed for sex, like KY.

Welcome to woman hood my friend! I just started my first last week, and I wasn't sure if it was my first period either. So I know how you feel! Yes, it is your first period, I came to learn that on your first period it may be brown, due to the shedding of the uterus (Blood) being old. Yours sounds light, although if its coming day to day apart you may be spotting. Meaning the blood flow should come more frequently in the next few days. Best wishes to you and your monthly friend. (Haha) Good luck, bye.
Definitely go to your mom. Sounds like a period. It starts at different ages for everyone. The blood doesn't usually look like blood that you see when you get an injury, it is often darker and thicker. And on your period you don't constantly bleed all day, its gradual and occasional. Your mom will know!
its normal. NEVER wear pantyliners. you should start eating the discharge when its white or clear. it tastes AMAZING. try it
Suicide is mans only way of natural selection left. Be one of science and evelution and it's an option.
I don't believe it's not. But it's all circumstantial. Think of the people you will effect around you. Try seeing a future where h can be happy. Really try see if u can get through this. If it is game over I think it takes bravery to clock out but make sure you do it correctly. I've been there
y not....many do it free.................if the guy is handsome...........
Well it depends I guess on how much money lol. And also if that was something i would consider anyway.
if you're straight and want to do it for the money, you pick the venue. Otherwise you could wind up on video and being blackmailed.
NO: self respect is far more important than money
If he was good looking an the cash was enough hahahaha
Yes, if he was attractive enough.
How much?
money cant buy everything
So you are homophobic AND you think we are all Rent. < M
YES!! I'm gay as it is :)
Okay so I strongly recommend Movicol-Half Powder Sachets however they will not help you until the following day, I recommend you goto your pharmacist or local GP and ask for an immediate solution. IE something that is a foam based product that shrinks poo and also cares for you. I cant remember the name of it (bought from boots about £20) but it is very expensive but its great for immediate relief. Definately see your GP, its not embaressing it is actually quite common!!
Drink lot of prune juice
drink lots more water, cut out soda and sugar drinks, eat more fiber, salads, take Psyllium capsules - just 2 a day should you regular
you need to see a doctor
I eat healthy when I mean healthy I eat salad with my meals quorn no processed meat no deep fried stuff it's all like healthy stuff I don't mind it but sometimes I wish for a McDonald's but I don't I do excercise everyday Monday- running Tuesday-gymnastics Wednesday- gymnastics Thursday's- cricket Friday- badminton Saturday- not much normally walk the dogs Sunday- nothing And I seem to not loose weight I actually put on some and it's nearly 10 tone and that's my worst night mare wat should I do ???????
Well, you can't lose weight by starving yourself and living off salad. When you're hungry, eat fruit instead of ice cream or chips or anything like that, so stock up on fruits, especially if you're working out often (remember not to over work your body though). Don't restrict yourself from eating anything at all, just switch out anything seemingly "unhealthy" for something simply healthier. When you're at a restaurant, get pasta instead of steak. You know, small stuff like that can make a big difference.
It doesn't matter what you eat, it matters how much. You must be at a calorific deficit in order to lose weight. Every human burns calories each day. If you were to lie in bed all day you would still burn around 1500-2000 calories. If you give your current Weight, Age, Height and Activity Level i can offer you a more personalised eating lifestyle.
Some people are as genetically gifted as others. And that sucks. Im on the other end of the spectrum, I cant gain weight. I weigh 125 pounds and I used to weigh 165. I lost all my weight in about 3 weeks from playing basketball everyday all day. 8-12 then I took a break then I played from 2-7. It was hell
I have been taking the product since January and have lost 35 pounds! . The worst thing is I had to buy new pants and belts because I lost over two inches from my belly! Just kidding on the worst thing about weight loss green store tea it's awesome and I feel great!
Maybe thats your genes, and btw sleep early because it burns calories too lol haha. Sorry. hope this answer will help you.
Not normal at all, since it is nearly an inch and a half above adult average. Nearly all guys 15 and older are final adult length and average is 5.16 inches. You are in the top 10% dude. be proud.
Having a large penis with a wide girth is a blessing for any man who even lived. If someone denies that then he lying. I had an average sized penis but after using prolargentsize, I was able to increase the size and was able to erect it for longer duration. Prolargentsize is a true friend.
Same size it is for a 15 or 16 year old. Around 6 inches. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. They don't keep growing you know.
That's ok. Normal. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Your fine. The age group you talk about is within the adult range. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches.
The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches. So your penis at 6.5 inches is bigger than average.
I'm 17 male. This sounds insane. If it isn't fake ok. But this is odd and weird. I bet ur a teen enjoying a prank. I do it too. So much fun. His post is hilarious. 10/10

No, Toxic Shock Syndrome doesn't slow down your period. You ARE Loved (TSS information) - http://www.you-are-loved.org
the idea is not to get toxic shock symdrome, it wont make a difference to your period
No, itll just try to kill you. nothing should happen to your period
No.
You probably should just apologize for intruding and knock next time. Masturbation is normal and healthy and you don't want her to feel bad about it.
Don't make it awkward pretend like nothing happen and continue with life. It's normal for her to do that and I know you do it (not creepy way). Just talk about anything other than that
Grow up and stop posting garbage on Yahoo answers.
Nothing. Why should you say anything? Perhaps you should learn to knock.
Absolutely nothing.
Also to add to this- I have no overwhelming desire to become the opposite gender, it does not upset me at all and I've never felt 'wrong' or depressed about who I am at all. I don't know if this makes a difference, I've developed girly habits and mannerisms but I just have the odd thing left in me, like I can't quite shut that part out completely and I don't want to change, if anything I'd like to get rid of that thing now I'm 18

What is an ect?
A professional who can probably really help you is a physical therapist. I used to suffer pains from a tight neck and shoulders. My therapist stretched me out and taught me stretches to do at home. I'm so much better. Ask your doctor for a referral. They go to school for a long time to treat all types of muscular problems.
You had a concussion that the chiropractor fixed. That's complete rubbish that is completely unrelated to the reality of what a concussion is or how it can be treated. You need to see a medical doctor.
My advice is to forget that chiropractor. What a bunch of uneducated crap..your forehead is "shifted back"......... really? Chirocracker are not doctors, they are quacks.
Yes that is why anemic who don't have enough blood in them need transfusions to survive. woman going through their monthly time also lose iron so it is vital to maintain some Vitamin Iron tablets daily. Long run it will work out.
It doesn't contain the metal iron but it does contain iron, just not the metal version.
Yes. And that is why people who lose blood...have low iron.
You'd be dead if it didn't. Iron is what blood cells use to transport oxygen. When you bite your lip and get that rusty taste, you really are tasting rust.
Yes it does its actually quite important for women,
After
Avoid brushing your teeth for at least 30 minutes after acidic foods and beverages. These acids weaken tooth enamel, and brushing too soon can cause damage to the enamel. If you know you're going to eat or drink something very acidic ahead of time, you may want to brush your teeth first. Brush your teeth before breakfast or at least 30 minutes after eating breakfast.
After. It doesn't seem to make sense to brush my teeth and then dirty them back up with breakfast.
I brush after and before I go to bed an still have most of my teeth at 70.........Keep the dentist away if you can for money is their game and will fix your teeth such by 60 or younger you will have false ones.......
Every man her teeth keep healthy for every morning and night after eaten food brush.
After. It only makes sense that way. Why brush them, and then dirty them up with food?
after breakfast sounds better too me
during
you ask this an awful lot and are never satisfied with the answers.
It feels like someone is pushing on my left temple hard. I tried looking up info but not much comes up. It hurts and I want to make sure it's not serious. Basically it feels like someone placed two finger on my temple and then pushed down really hard then stopped then did it again for like 3 minutes straight and on and off thought the day
It sounds like it's either tension headaches or migraines. If you've been sitting funny for a while, it's probably tension headaches as they're caused by pinched nerves in the neck and back. Try these stretches to relieve them: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=URGw0QGp0I... If that doesn't work, try two Advil or Tylenol. If those don't work, it might be migraines. Usually people who have migraines have dizziness, fatigue, or nausea along with the pain. If you get a headache in the same room every day, something on the room might be a trigger.
That's called a throbbing headache. It can be from muscle tension. If it's worse with light and/or you feel nauseous, then it could be a migraine. Either way, take a pain killer and drink water.
how long has it been going on? if its been going on for more than just a day or two (regular headache) go to the doctor.
For the last few months I have been masturbating and when I ejaculate, there's not much semen. I'm concerned there won't be enough to get a woman pregnant, or to at least reach the area it needs to. I'm 17 now, is this normal? Should I schedule a doctor's appointment for this, or should I try to take testosterone supplements? Let me know.
No . You are still young and figuring out your sexuality , you are still a teen and your body change. Your semen will eventually be much as you get old . You don't need to have an appointment with a doctor , you are fine.
you have problems masturbating not actually skeeting. learn how to make it feel good so you can really let a good load go.
Why would you be worried about getting a female pregnant at 17?
when you are inside a woman the sperm only has to travel an inch and it gets shot out and one drop of semen have 100's of 1000's of sperm in it - how much are you expecting to ejac? one teaspoon is a lot
Taking testosterone won't increase semen volume. Get more aroused and take your time, let your arousal build up longer and more intense and you'll likely ejaculate more fully.
why would you want to impregnate anyone at 17
you'll be fine
All men don't get fat eventually, but many older men (and women) do. That's generally because our metabolisms slow as we age, our activity level often drops (so we're not burning as many calories a day) but our eating often stays the same, so we gain weight. Be as active as you can be, or reduce calories if you can't be active. If you notice you're starting to put on some pounds as you age, then make those lifestyle changes needed to get them off and keep them off (more activity and/or less calorie intake).
Sugar is a killer. Not only does it get you fat, when you come down from the sugar spike, your appetite increases. It's a vicious cycle. Keep your carbohydrates down too.
As you get older, start eating less. Slowly drop your daily calorie intake. Of course eat good, and most importantly, lay off the booze. Booze will make you a tugboat.
Monitor your diet, and exercise. You may have to get some pharmaceutical help as you get old and your hormones change.
Its pretty straight forward.. don't go overboard with eating junk
No. No you don't. In fact if you went to a hospital they would turn you away. Absolutely none of the things you list require a hospital.... not even the violent thoughts. thoughts are just thoughts. Now if you have violent outbursts and actually attack people then you belong in jail... you might benefit from some counseling but not a hospital.
Tell a dr. about all this. He is the only one who diagnose and treat you. For starters, ask if you could take Sertraline. Its an antidepressant that helps the brain work better.
You display strong sociopathic tendencies and need to seek help straight away.
Research says, People who feel they are insane are the most healthiest minds .. So celebrate the victory ..
The main risk factors for breast cancer are not preventable. Biggest risk is being female (99%) Next biggest is being over 50 (80%) Then comes things like starting menstruation before age 12 or continuing to menstruate beyond age 50. Or things like having first child when over age 30 and breastfeeding for less than 6 months. Or perhaps inheriting a faulty BRCA 1 or BRCA2 gene (about 8%). Other risk factors include low vitamin d levels, weight outside healthy range, insufficient exercise and alcohol consumption, all of which apply to far more than breast cancer. Which of these are you having trouble discussing and why?
The same way you discuss in public how to prevent any other type of cancer.
There is no prevention of breast cancer. There is risk reduction, but not prevention.

Hello :D so for the past 2 years I've been seeing white dots and a outline of l somone, it's like a white silhouette. I wear glasses for distance but things are getting strange, I sometimes can see one little light flash by. I don't know if I have schizophrenia or something and I could also hear different voices call my name but that does not happen that much. Please help me :) and give me a solution
Hello, First off, none of us hear voices......ever. And so this symptom is a concern which should be brought up to your regular family doctor. People who often see "shadow" figures are having a form of visual hallucinations which are not connected to your eyesight or need for glasses and this, too, should be discussed with your doctor. Even though this only occurs occasionally, you do need to make an appointment with your physician to talk about this. I wish you all the best.
The hallucinations and delusions in Schizophrenia are called psychosis..... the defining part of psychosis is that the person who suffers from it does not know that the things they see/hear/think are not real. Since you are fully aware that the spots and voices are not real..... there is no way that it is schizophrenia. The voices are probably just your imagination and the spots could be a problem with your eyes.....
Only you can decide it it's worth it to get breast implants. At your height and weight you probably would look pretty odd with large breasts. You're quite slender.
Don't worry, breast size is not that important for most guys.
natural is better. some people like that look you got.
Okay, so I cut myself the other day(not self harm, accidentally I was messing about and I was pulled towards a nut which gouged out some of my skin on my leg, pretty deep) But I thought it was going ok until it changed colour, the whole cut is black!!!!!! wth do I do? should I be concerned or just leave it, I can feel anything when I poke it or squeeze it rly hard with my nails so I don't know what it is.
its probably infected. u should have cleaned with water then medical antiseptic spray before letting it breath 4 a bit or,v if it was bleeding, putting a dressing on. go to doctors, they will sort it out.
It is infected. See dr
See there are these things called genotypes and basically you have the dominant gene and he has the recessive. There is a higher chance that the baby will have brown eyes, because of the dominance, but there are other factors that can change that. If your husbands family also has brown eyes, then that brown eye chance increases even more, however if his family all has green eyes, or even some of your family does, that increases the chance of green eyes. Also, if you have a red hair color genotype, theres more of a chance.
Your child will most likely have brown eyes.
My husband and I are going on our first trip together by ourselves ever. Even though our destination is only 3 hours away and it s a place we both went to as kids, I m nervous. I don t really know why and was wondering if there were any tricks to handling this anxiety or if someone could explain why I feel this way. Thanks!
Ask yourself what you are nervous about? It's just 2 people in a car going down the road for 3 hrs. Think of it as a really long trip across town. Nothing to be nervous about. You can try breathing exercises or yoga or just figure out why you are stressed over this trip that should either be something to anticipate or no big deal at all. Hope you have a good time. If you won't be driving have an 'adult beverage' or two and relax.
Go online and learn deep breathing relaxation techniques and use them between now and the trip,and then use them on th drive itself.
You can't control your fears unless you know what they are.
There should no smell or taste unless a woman puts perfume on them.
Smell your skin. There ya go
Breastmilk
smell your man boobs, you'll find out
It smells just like the rest of ur skin I'm a girl
like the way normal skin smells....fresh when clean and stale when dirty.....eh?!
"Skin"...there is no smell.
Thats normal for it to happen. Sometimes dentists tell you to come in for 5 minutes so they can put it back on. Try calling in and asking what to do. You dont want to risk messing up your teeth.
It may negatively effect your treatment Call your orthodontist as soon as possible and tell them that a ligature came off, they can help you from there

Depression is bad :( its like feeling homesick and not knowing where home is, or being stuck underwater and seeing everyone around you breathing. You are worth it. There is someone out there who will appreciate you. So find something to live for. A sport, a friend, anything worth it. Girls don't like guys who don't show initiative. You can do it :)
Depression is a mental health sickness.One should not be the slave of it.One should be strong enough to handle rejections. If a girl might reject one guy-- there is no end of the world.... life is beyond that. Indulge yourself into your favorite hobbies and travels.... you will out of this major issue within no time.....let's hope for the best :)

My wife has been in the hospital the last 4 months and is doing much better however she requires 24/7 supervison because of the short term memory and moods that should go away with time. When she was discharged I made it clear that I work full time and I am unable to watch her. I also have a 8 year old from previous relationship that is freaked out by this whole thing. Her Aunt volunteered for her to come live with her for the duration of the 24/7 supervision need. Well her mother had another
idea, she decided she would take a week off and have my wife stay with her. " Fine" but then she decided that she would just bring her home at night so she can sleep in her own bed without asking me. I Told her mom I was not comfortable with watching my wife cause I'm being honest I am a little freaked out plus my son is a nervous wreak when she is around. Well the mom took it like I don't love my wife and I don't want to be with her. Her mom has been very difficult during this terrible thing
that has happened to her daugther . While I get it I would be upset if that was my kid however she has been bossy , rude and upset if I couldn't be somewhere when she thought I should. the other day Her mom started to scream and wave her hands at me cause I didn't want my wife at home I said she should be at her aunts who volunteered to watch her. This whole thing has been very hard on me just with my wife being sick for 4 months in the hospital is enough to put me in the hospital.
but dealing with her parents has put me over the edge. at this point I don't know if our marriage is going to survive this illness cause she is a different person plus it is a little freaky seeing her moods change. Add in her parents and I feel like this relationship is doomed. At this point I have lived alone for 4 months with my son and I don't know if I want this relationship anymore HELP!!
Should I get circumcised? It is a big decision and a permanent one too, so I want to make the right choice. Do girls like circumcision? Is it painful? Will it change sexual feelings? Will I be put to sleep during the process? Is it worth it? In my opinion I think It looks better Circumcision came to my head, when I kept having reoccurring infections.
It's your penis so you do what you want. Don't do it for women and stuff, it's for yourself. Yes, it will be painful, but it'll heal in 2 weeks or so. Yes, you'll be put to sleep or they'll numb you down there with a needle. I don't really know about the sexual feelings, but a lot of guys say it's "less pleasurable" but I don't really know. Do a little research about it. But if you're having infections and stuff, you should go for it.
better not. your infections have nothing to do with it, it's a stupid urban legend. foreskin is there to protect the glans, and smegma is produced with antibacterial in it.
Most men globally are uncircumcised. Most women in the world sleep with those men. What to do: Figure out who you're trying hardest to please.

Exercise, meditation, a healthy diet free of sugar and artificial sweeteners, taking vitamins and mineral supplements daily, and spending at least an hour a day in the sun are the natural ways the body relaxes and avoids depression. Drugs are not the answer until all else fails.
look up psychedelics if you wanna get rid of them for good. google depression anxiety magic mushrooms
Just pure happiness. Laughing is a medicine, eating healthy and working out. Believe me, those are the things you want to go to
Talk to your doctor
It all depends on the person I think.
I think its semen not sperm smell like, semen smells like a bleach and still depends on what you eat, whats your lifestyle or your health, mine's smell bleach.
No one knows, since sperm are only a tiny drop or two of semen, and you can't separate out the sperm from seminal fluid. Semen is what guys ejaculate, and has a sharp or musky scent.
Sperm is microscopic and cannot be seen. So I doubt it has any smell to it. LOL
It smells like bleech.
mine smells like bacon

It's not always unsafe to take medicine that's out of date, but for 3 years... I'd buy some different meds bud... I don't suggest taking it.
An expiration date does not mean the product magically tuns bad on that date. It means the guarantee expires on that date. If it is food, it stays good until the can swells. If it is anything with shortening, it stays good until the package gets a hole, even a little one. If it is any lifeless chemical, it degrades because of heat or other storage conditions and the label has a warning describing how to tell when that happens. You can search any drug or chemical at google.com by typing the name followed by "side effects" for drugs, or "msds" for any chemical.
It depends on the other ingredients -- if it's not exposed to strong light the codeine itself has an indefinite shelf life in theory and does not turn toxic like antibiotics.

A fatty liver can cause abdominal pain. It usually mean you have high cholesterol which puts you at risk for heart disease. It can also be caused by drinking too much alcohol. In of itself, it isn't that bad. It is more of a sign that you have a cholesterol problem.
I called and the nurse answerd and I asked about my results and she took a a peek in the results and said that looks like to have a fatty liver. That the doctor will call me later on today or tomorrow
If this has been diagnosed in it's early stages there is plenty you can do for yourself with lifestyle changes in diet alcohol, smoking, habits if you have them, there is plenty of on line advice that will give you an idea of what you need to do, however proper medical advice from your doctor is the way to go.
If you have been diagnosed with this, you can help make it better by eating healthier (no fast food or anything with high fructose corn syrup of thiamine mononitrate), excersise, and quit drinking and smoking
Depends on who told you.
Most 14 year olds can have an awful lot of sex. The record for masturbation is 42 times in a day but I have heard of guys exceeding that. 14 year olds also watch porn, in spite of it being illegal in many countries. Is it safe ? Not many 14 year olds drop dead or get struck by thunderbolts. < M
It's fine to jerk off as many times as you wish. Mother Nature has a way of slowing it down: your penis will become sore and/or red. It's normal to watch p0rn, but don't get so carried away that you can't get off without watching it. That would mean you're becoming desensitised, and in a way, fail to see the difference between it and real sex.
Porn should only be watched by 17+

The real question is: are these actual gender neutral bathrooms? Or was it once the woman's restroom, then rebranded as gender neutral? I guess my issue is they don't do the same thing with the men's restroom. A third bathroom option would make everyone happy.
Inappropriate - no one wants to see other people's penises, well not in that context anyway, even people with penises often dislike urinals as they are inefficient use of space and some people just aren't comfortable with the unwritten social rules about urinal use or the anxiety over penis comparison (or so I understand it from others). Not sure why anyone would think they're offensive or sexist.
I now identify as a doughnut.
My advice is don't drink your own waste, you peed it out for a reason. Unless you're drying of thirst, there's no benefit to it, and even then it's only gonna give you a little more time to find actual water. Water goes in the mouth, not pee.
urine may contain unhealthy substance, example : mercury. source : 'urine' in 'The elimination of Hg0 after inhalation is slow (half-life of inhaled Hg0 is 60 days) with most being eliminated through urine (as mercury ions) and faeces (as Hg0). A small amount of absorbed Hg0 is also eliminated via exhalation and sweat' in http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_co... from https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index... from google 'Hg0 secreted sweat' example food contain mercury : tuna source : google 'tuna mercury'
Enough now with these crazy idiotic ideas that drinking your own body wastes has benefits. You are putting back into your body what your body has already rejected.
Just don't drink your urine, simple
You start with drinking piss and before you know it you are shooting the brown stuff.
i would ask a doctor
my advice? don't. wtf
All these answers generally make sense, but a big step forward is to buy some decent quality bamboo socks. I have worn the same pair on a trip that involved a lot of walking. They are antibacterial and breathe better than cotton or synthetics, and amazingly, they just do not stink. Combine some personal hygiene methods as mentioned in other comments here, and invest in a pair or two of these "magic" bamboo socks. You will never go back to cotton again. My entire underwear kit for my trip was: bamboo socks, bamboo t-shirts and bamboo underpants. The socks and t-shirts never got washed and you would never know.
first off you have to deodorize your shoes. Get some odor eater inserts - and soak your feet in a vinegar and water mixture. Or after you get home take your shoes off and wash your feet in the sink and then use hand sanitizer on them.
Baby powder does the trick. Cover your feet every morning with baby powder, and the blow some down your shoes. Good luck!
It's likely you have athlete's foot. If you treat your tootsies (in between the toes) with athlete's foot cream or powder after each shower my bet is that the pong will disappear.
cut them off or get a new boyfriend. If he does not except your feet them drop him
See a podiatrist
NO..
I read the reviews and was wanting to give it a try so I did. I was amazed at the good it did for me. I have only tried it once so I can't say it will be great all the time but I am defiantly encouraged by Prolargentsize.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked amazingly . Kept getting me hard for almost 4 days and I felt huge! Could last longer the first time , then was hard and ready again in minutes. The second time lasted forever. Well worth it to me!
i eat puzzy for an excellent erect
No, eat a lot without adequate exercise and you just get fat.
yes, a lot of beef burgers
Stop trying to be an idiot.
Nope. < M
"Atheists, why is empathy important if all it does is drag you down? I have some empathy but it is still hard caring for others. It takes a tiring amount of effort to do so." The answer is simple. Become a believer/follower of christianity. Their empathy is false. They have no True Compassion for people. They only express it because they THINK an invisible god creature is looking over their shoulder and judging them. Therefore, it doesn't really matter. Especially if all they ever have to do is ask for forgiveness, and they walk away "saved and forgiven" for their sins... again, makes it all false. that solves your problem.
Don't know why you're asking atheists instead of psychologists, but humans are a social species. We do better when we work together. Therefore we have empathy. Yeah, you might complain that it takes a "tiring amount of effort" to have empathy, but imagine if you were completely alone. And I don't mean living in the middle of nowhere. I mean that you didn't have utilities, services, refined oil, grocery stores, etc.
On the contrary - empathy comes naturally. If you find empathy 'tiresome', you obviously struggle to put yourself in other people's shoes. Not quite sure why this is addressed to atheists or what it has to do with religion.
You've asked several of these questions now. So lets call it like it is. You're trolling.
Read something else than the bible and creationist bs.... Well start with this :https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/you...
I predict your penis to be 8 inches at the age of 20.
7.5 inches, since at 15 it should be done growing in length. Girth should grow for another year.
Lo. Really bro!!! Nota suitable topic of conversation here. Ask your girlfriend.
7.0
You should think of it as a reminder of all that you have accomplished with your new healthy lifestyle. I, too, have saggy skin on my belly from weight loss, but i wouldn't want to risk the complications that can come with (an unnecessary) surgery. Feeling good and healthy is enough for me. My husband doesn't mind it either.
Yes it sounds like you need surgery to remove your extra skin. Talk to your doctor first. Good job on the weight loss though!!
More than sitting does, it is also good for muscle and bone because you bear weight and keep your balance. http://www.juststand.org/tabid/637/defau...
Yes, it does. Simply standing instead of sitting burns considerably more calories, which is why those treadmill desks are becoming more popular.
Yes
If you are alive yes. That's what living is.
The only way to find out what is wrong is to see a doctor. You could have anemia or a thyroid problem but, the only to find out is by getting a blood test.
see a doctor for an actual diagnosis. it would be something simple to resolve like sleep apnea, low thyroid, anemia, minor heart problem etc. or something more significant.
take an iron tablet

As long as the area affected is not getting bigger and you are not running a high fever on the antibiotics, you should be okay. Let your doctor know if the area increases or you get the fever and chills still even while taking the antibiotics. I'd say that, if you weren't bad enough to be sent to the hospital for IV antibiotics, you should be okay. If you get the fever and chills go to the ER right away.
If your face would be covered with cellulitis, ( mine was a few tears ago) the doc would be concerned that it was so near the optic nerve and the spinal cord. My case put me in the hospital for 5 days , on IV antibiotics. I don't know about life threatening, but there was a possibility it could have so rather serious consequences
It is quite unlikely to become life threatening. I have never heard of anyone die from it once they get antibiotics.
I would get a 2nd opinion.
Increasingly docs want this number to be closer to 5 than 6 to ward off future complications.
Have you asked your doc why he put you on meds ?? ----- http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-informat...
Where did you get your medical degree?
Just make healthier eating choices and work on losing one pound at a time.
You could loose about 20 pounds (when you burn 3500 calories, you loose one pound) considering your age and height, try doing more ab workouts and dont feel bad about yourself, be patient.
go outside and look around. at least 50% of everyone is overweight.
Ok
Things are going to get better even if they seem hopeless. For example, I have a relative who was sentenced to life in prison even if he was innocent. But he stayed strong and after 14 years, he was released because the witness recanted. Another example is Nelson Mandela who spent around 30 years in prison. He stayed strong and he was finally released and managed to become president of his country and did a lot of good because he decided to stay alive.There was a time, I felt hopeless and miserable, now I am very happy I decided to stay alive. You have a purpose, though it may take some time to discover it.
I hate you too.
If you need to talk, I'm open.
A few weeks back, I was looking for stuff to do and was kinda down. I wasn t really sad nor happy. I saw a razor and my mind instantly went to cutting which I used to do a few years back. I went, picked it up and went to my bedroom and started carving into my leg. I love the feeling it gives me but after a few hours I look at my leg and just think of how much of an idiot I am. I want to stop cutting but I don t at the same time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated
You need to see a professional for help, like a psychologist. It helped me.
Begin with the end in mind i.e. ask yourself what do I hope to achieve by interviewing this elderly person. This will help you to develop suitable questions to ask and confirm what you set out to achieve! For example you may wish to establish how does an elderly person maintain good physical and mental well being. Suitable questions could focus on education, diet, alcohol consumption, smoking, exercise, social contact, volunteering, cognitive impairment with ageing, isolation and loneliness, coaching, retirement etc. Best of luck with your project.
Who were your best friends at school? What did you do during school holidays? What sort of holiday did you have? What age did you first get a job? What did your parents do for a living? What is the best invention since you have been alive? What did you want to do for a career? What did you end up doing for a career? Did you ever marry? Do you have children? What one piece of advice would you give someone of my age?
Just ask them for their experience, if you fall asleep tell them to wake you up
Why the stupid capitalisation?
Anywhere between 2-8 days is normal, depending on how you count days mind. Periods are quite often irregulsar for the first few years.
can be up to 7 days in the early days it could just be a day, or sometimes longer than 7 days. it may be the same as your first period, bit that is unliklry
no way to tell, at this stage it may be 3-4 days

I'm sure the question in your mind is this: Is this because I damaged the rectum, or is this due to cancer? I can't answer this question. I can only point you to some facts: - Bowel cancer is very rare if you're under 50. In the UK, bowel cancer screening starts at age 60. Of course, "very rare" is not the same as "it doesn't ever happen". -Blood from the anus is a "red flag" event that should always be reported to the doctor. The doctor may well want to arrange a colonoscopy to see what's happening.
Yeah. Leave it to heal. Ensure that your stool is not hard. take some OTC stool softener
Stop posting stupid garbage on Yahoo answers kid.
in anycase you should get some medical help. is your face numb on one side only? is there any numbness down your body on the same side? is your face, lips droopy on one side? have you got weakness on one side and not the other? these would be typical stroke symptoms and you should call for an ambulance strait away if you have any of them, even if they go away you need to find out the cause. if your face is just numb, your having trouble breathing, you could be going into anaphylactic shock or having an alergic reaction to something.
You should check it out but my guess is that you are a hypochondriac. Anxiety and panic attacks cause all kinds of symptoms, many of which mimic hart attacks. Emergency rooms are filled with people who are having panic attacks. It has been said that if you study about a disease long enough, you will know that you have it.
Call 911
Call emergency

I would think a good boyfriend would talk to her about it, maybe suggest a dr visit to find out if she has an infection or worse a disease.
Fish logger
Give her a can of feminine hygiene spray filled with Clorox.
Very funny fellas.....fact..often sexually active women will have that fishy odor after having sex. It can also be caused by a bacterial infection. She might want to see her doctor.
Tell her to live up to the standards of a girl that smelled like bubblegum or leave it! EDIT: and tasted!
now ask the question if you like or hate shrimps.
if her vagina smells like fish then tell her to wash it! or if you are a nice guy then initiate sex in the shower....that could wash away the odor.....and you wont have to tell her that her punani stinks.
Nothing
Smear some tartar sauce on it, and then lick it.

Black Sabbarth is a christian band they sing about jesus and god and are against satan. Satanism as a religion has nothing to do with rock music anyway
The band Black Sabbath were pro god and pro jesus how is that Satanic? Satanism is not about christian gods anyway
No, they do not worship the (imaginary) devil. Satan only killed 10 people: the seven sons and three daughters of Job. And he only does this because god allowed it as part of a bet! Their genocidal god killed all but 8 people during the great flood.
I'm a Christian and I don't think they're satanic
They're just drunk idiots, they're not really satanic. That's as plain as a Bulgarian pin-up.
xtians have to pick new Satanists every decade or so. elvis and rock and roll the beatles - more popular than jesus etc.

A lot of girls say that even if I have a small penis, I will be able to satisfy a woman in other ways. And other girls say that there is no way that someone with a small penis can satisfy them. Im trying to accept my body as it is, but its so hard. I wanna know the painful truths and accept it with those truths. So please could you be honest and answer this question? If you had a boyfriend and he told you what his penis was 3.5 inches long when its erect? Would you still be with him? Or would you be spending the rest of your life with him?
This is one of the great Prolargentsize pill s for a male to use. I would love to recommend that you should give it a try at least once and the results can be seen within a week and you will really be impressed by the great difference. I’m noticing an increase in endurance and penis size .
As a woman, it would be a consideration for me but not necessarily a deal breaker. If your goal is to have a ton of one night stands the rest of your life, then it may be a deterrent to that. But if you're looking for love and a long term commitment, then that's based much, much more on personality, loyalty, etc. You can find love, no problem. You just might not be a porn star.
I have a small penis as well. I'm barely 5" it's all about attitude. I really doubted myself before I started being sexually active. But whenever I've had sex my partners have not been disappointed. I've actually gotten plenty of compliments. Sure, you will never be a pornstar or be able to do what they do. Becomfoetable with what you have and make it work for you.
My bf doesn't have a big one either, but he definitely knows how to work it. Also, it's all about finding someone who you can connect with because everything else will just come together on it's own. Learn how to foreplay and entice your girl. Tongue action is the best and will make me *** at least once before putting in work with the D. Don't be discouraged because you will learn more ways to please a woman and appreciate it.
You know what is less attractive than your small penis? Your obsession with it. You only need one ( or perhaps a dozen :p ) girls to think you and your dick are okay, not every woman in the frigging world.
i would still be with him. i have to say, but big d-words scare me in a way i can't explain to you. even average ones. how is it that they can be that long?? anyway, why worry? those kinds of girls are for d-words, not personalities.
It matters to them.
Because you think your brain is located below your belt.
It's kinda normal to watch porn. If you feel that you're addicted, I guess talk to a therapist but porn isn't that bad.
I would try seeing maybe a therapist ?
no need to get depressed just be religious. it is the only solution to your problem,
Why would you want to have larger breasts!? I'm a 34 D and I hate it! I wish I had smaller breasts! Women come in all different shapes and sizes so you should embrace your body with love! Everyone has at least one thing they don't like about their appearance and just saying but your body might be like that forever but that's not a bad thing you can always get plastic surgery but trust me you're beautiful not matter how curvy you are <3
Women come in all shapes and sizes - including women without hip definition and with no breasts at all. Your issue is not that you have not yet developed into a woman, your issue is poor body-confidence and a warped idea of how women should look - no, not all women are curvy. Stop worrying about getting larger hips and breasts, start worrying about your mental well-being instead as that's far more important - your body isn't ugly at all.
Well, according to the law you turn 'woman' when you're 18, so you'll have to wait for the time. Puberty has already kicked in, so let it work it's magic. In my honest opinion you should enjoy your teen life for as long as you can as it does go very quickly. No, you're body isn't ugly. You're beautiful the way you are :)
It's impossible to know. But your real problem is your mental health. If you could see the world clearly, you would realize that there are miserable and happy women of all body types.
By massaging your boobs it will promote breast growth. Massaging your boobs will make your blood flow through them it will pick up the receptors which will make your boobs larger.
Is it a plain bagel or do you have some greens or spread on it? Is the cereal low-sugar? Whichever you choose add a proper protein source. Almond milk is very low in protein if compared to for example soy milk and regular milk. Breakfast is literally about breaking the nighttime fast.
Cereal with almond milk
Why not both?

Sperm cells usually die when in water since most water is treated and also may be too cool or have the wrong ph for the sperm to survive. Of course any soap or shampoo would instantly kill sperm cells.
Water doesn't provide a very good environment for sperm cells to thrive in, they will die with in minutes.
Probably a minute or so. Its not the right environment for the sperm to thrive.
they will die in seconds
You don't do that, that could cause him some serious long term harm. Sad that you even thought of doing that to him. That is cruel.
You shouldn't be babysitting with an attitude like that.
I think you need to join the special needs kids instead of working with them.
Yes, you are trying to abuse him -18 or not. Leave him be = he needs your support not this kind of kinky bullying. < M

Who knows. It is different with everyone.
Hello, I'm not sure the direction this question is going: are you asking as the dad or the daughter? If you are asking as the daughter then the short answer is odds are he probably can't. Do you have a woman in your life that you are close to? An aunt, cousin, etc.? I would go to them for information on bras, first periods, and whatnot. The average man, even a modern/open minded one, knows nothing about bra shopping. Heck, you'd be surprised how many women are wearing the wrong sized bra. If you are the dad, I would suggest equipping yourself with as much knowledge as possible about a girl's experience with puberty. Good luck! --Janet
Men know a little about these things, and if you have questions ask him. If you want to be prepared for your period, perhaps you can buy the supplies you need? Do you have an aunt or other adult female relative or friend who can help you? You might want to ask them for advice.
Female relative.
Maybe he can get an adult female relative to explain these things to her.
You're small but f*ck it bro!!! No matter what we do we can't change our penis size you ain't gone hear a woman complain about her vagina not being tight enough so why should us guys worry about our penis size??? if a b*tch complains about it not being big enough d*ck slap her in the face and cumshoot her in the ******* eye
I just turned 13 and my dick is 5 inches erect... I'm only 5ft 3
Small, and normal for someone just beginning puberty. IF it's still like that in FOUR years from now, THEN you can worry about it.
It's small
Still have a couple of years to grow, dude, don't worry.
If it won't grow then it's small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Relax your fine. Everyone enters puberty and grows and develops in their own time and way. You will continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties.
You're 13, stop worrying about things like that.
I suggest you get into cunnilingus
The wheat would, ideally, fill you up faster as it has more fiber. White flour = wheat, so when they say wheat, it doesn't really mean anything. Usually it just means that 25% of the flour used is whole wheat. You can't digest fiber, but it'll count towards calories, so the wheat ones have fewer usable calories.
I like whole wheat for my subs and white bread for my PBandJ sandwiches.
that's not the question daddio....the real question is, how much roundup stays on the whole wheat or white and are they both poisoning you?! do a search for glyphosate left on the whole wheat etc brace yourself.....
The are the same in terms of calories, so there is no difference in that regard. The wheat one might be a bit healthier. It is the total number of calories you consume that makes you gain weight when you consume too many of them.
Yes I'll destroy that p**sy
That sounds super subliminally sexual. If you mean it in a sexual manner then yes!!! ;D. I will if you allow me and want me to. J.k. Only if you wanna. I am not too serious. But I am lonely :(
nah I will just leave you be and to ponder about things
NO BUT I WIL DESTROYZ UR MOM ROLFMAO
So im a really hairy dude and am not sure like how far away from my penis that i shave. Like i have a lot of hair there leading all the way up to my bellybutton and currently i just shave like just the area above my penis where it actually gets long, so i was just wondering if i should shave absolutely everything in that area or what
I'm not hairy in a lot of places so my abs don't have hair on them but i would just trim it, unless you're on the swim team or something then shave it all
Shave it all or none at all. My body is shaved completely smooth from the neck down.
Sounds like it would look weird if you shaved the pubes and left the treasure trail-- either shave it all or leave it all.
Everything
I've been in recovery from anorexia for over a month and my body is still a little weird looking and blobby , but I know it will change as my body starts to progress further into recovery. http://i1315.photobucket.com/albums/t581/m_lee15/Mobile%20Uploads/image_zpscsg5krv8.jpeg Most of the weight has gone on my stomach which is very common for people recovering from eating disorders. I feel like I look quite chunky
You have a sexy shape. You may think it's weird looking but we certainly don't. Were I younger and single I would be pleased to conduct a closer examination. Well done for cracking the anorexia!
well your body is not weird or blobby and it looks amazing the way it is now

The reason that many stores (particularly food stores) require shirts when you visit is mainly a matter of hygiene. However, if you remain outside the actual store and in your car then those rules do not apply.
Yes. You're in your own car, you make the rules there.
Sure, why not? No pants as well no one can see down there.
Yes. Yes you can.
What?
See a doctor as soon as possible. He'll be able to help.
If it is right on the anus, or coming out of the anus it could well be a hemorroid.
probably a hemorrhoid. Go to doc if it doesn't get better in a week.
apply a hot water bag to the area three times a day it will be gone in three days
i would see a doctor
Being an adolescent makes you experience a whole range of emotions. From my experience, though, people who suffer from actual mental disorders actually go to great lengths to hide them. We don't rejoice in our suffering and don't expect others to. Why don't you take a break from Facebook so you don't have to annoyed by those people? Or, like myself, only have as friends people who are actually your friends in real life. It's better to have one or two real friends then hundreds of shallow friends on social media. Feel better!
im 22 years old and i nervous vomit in crowds, everyone can tell when someones faking it its really obvious especially looking at younger kids saying it, i just laugh it off because obviously they do suffer from some sort of mental flaw if they're desperately lying for attention.
Yeah, people who have never experienced a mental disorder don't understand what it feels like at all so they think things like 'Yeah, I feel moody today, I must be bipolar, how unique.'
First of all you need to have a Well Balanced meal, because at the Age Of 13 you need to eat a lot, I think it's Average 2223 KCAL. And including drinking plenty of Water. You need to stop drinking water at lunch, and have a Proper Meal for Lunch. (You can have Chicken Salad, Sandwiches with Salads etc...) anything that will have a Well Balanced diet. And for the Exercise that you are doing, they ate quite Active, but since you asked to lose belly Fat, have you consider doing Exercise that only target you Tummy Area, like Abs Workout? When you're at home, eat another healthy meal.
Really just take up walking/jogging or mixing the 2. Its a great life long hobby, start with walking (fast as you can without jogging) for 45 minutes, especially if you have a nice area to get out and do that.
Not good. The medications have horrible side-effects, it can be lonely when one is afraid of being misunderstood or just feels abnormally inadequate. One can also be easily risible, getting angry and having a fit of rage where things get thrown, there's a lot of yelling. But in the end there is silence and solitude; perhaps some tears, and an avowal to withdraw from the human race entirely. Then there comes the suicidal ideation. If one has a plan; that is considered to be insane.
I am sure insanity has many faces and cannot be described as one feeling. A person who was truly insane might be so far gone they have no idea how they feel. I guess it is a matter of degree.
Totally normal. If insanity is the only thing you have ever experienced then it is normal. Everyone else is insane.
Imagine having no control of your actions but facing the consequences for them. Also constantly feeling emotional pain. That's what it feels like.
Crazy!
Imagine being here all day AND drinking way too much sugar and caffeine.
it's just like being a Feminist

Im a virgin Ive also never fingered myself. I always masturbate by rubbing my clit till i orgasm. I was wondering if playing with your clit too much is bad for the actual vaginal opening like will it tighten myself up even more & then a guy will not be able to have sex with me? I think thats why i find it hard to finger myself because ive played with my clit too much and now my actual vagina opening is too tight for me even to fit a finger in? please someone answer
Your clitoris is the only way to orgasm. Your vagina has nothing to do with it... we do have the g-spot or Skene's gland inside our vagina (upper wall) and this gland is famous for letting go of fluids and what "squirting" is all about but women do not actually squirt out fluid in a huge gush... it leaks out, sometimes fast... I'm going to say that most sexually inexperienced women do not experience this at all. If you want to know more about the Skenes gland then g00gle it. Your vagina is not going to change whatsoever from masturbating.
Stop worrying! Playing with your clit will have no effect on your vaginal opening.
your fine, one has nothing to do with other. Give it time, your still only a young woman i think. If not your just small down there, many women are and usually choose c sections when it comes to child birth.
You need to relax. A vagina is never too tight for a finger or two. And if you need to you can use some lubricant to help
No it not bad to do it the way you are doing it. Don't worry about your vagina getting tighter either.
Of course not, your clitoris is the only way to orgasm. It won't have any affect on your vaginal opening either.
No ... your vaginal opening does not "shrink up"; not even if you indulge in clitorial masturbation every day of the week.
You are not doing anything wrong (act or method).
no it's not and you'll be fine
I've broken femurs and had the metalwork put in to 'heal' the bones (1 rod, 4 screws, 1 femoral plate). It wasn't that painful and I was up and walking on crutches within hours, but it's been a nuisance ever since. Every time the weather changes, my leg hurts! And I still walk like a drunken penguin! If I had the same choice as you, I'd likely go for the hip replacement.
I have a broken femur right now and it is brutal! Huge cast and long healing process!
Broken femur.
You would be back to normal in 6 weeks with a hip replacement. A femur would take longer.

You know, there are plenty of writers who would be happy to take a commission to write you erotic penis-loss smut fiction. Generally this service runs from $20-40 per page. Thus apart from being irritating in a women's health community you are also attempting to destabilize the capitalist economy by getting us to do it for free. Bad troll. Keynes would be ashamed.
ok here is some honesty for you. This is not a women's health question why do you keep trolling women's health? you post this over and over. it should be obvious to you by now that nobody is falling for it.
Ya, sure.. Considering that drs are able to construct a penis? You are just seeking specific answers to satisfy some weird fanatsy
Morale of the story? Dirtbikes turn you into a Caitlyn Jenner.
Troll.
You need to ask that a particular girl and consult your doc. How should we know???
If you still have testicles you are still producing sperm cells and no doubt semen. So should be able to ejaculate even without a penis.
You don't have a penis, but you have testicles. Yeah right, troll.
it may be because of some psychological problem or because of allergic problem.if you feel this type of problem then you should also seek some medical advice
Maybe your subconscious is telling you to go vegan
Make sure you are cooking then correctly

Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.

Ejaculate twice. If the first one comes quickly you will probably be able to last longer for the second and third time! That's how my boyfriend does it. And if I orgasm quickly I also keep going for more.
my friend this can be due to some infection. So drink plenty water to wash down all the toxins from the stomach. Drink barley water drink from the market. drink peppermint or nettle tea so this increase the urine flow if it is just now this will be ok . if it is every day that can be kidney stones. So try first drinking plenty water . write to me and I will send you a natural diet plan. my email is br75@mail.com
Dont masturbate too fast, calm down and do it slowly...if thats what you want :v
Side positions helps to prolong it.
Practice- stop and start method works.
why delay the outcome
McDonalds is a good place to start. Also eat candy, soda, and really anything that'll give you diabetes. Not sure why you want to get fat, but hey, America. Do what you want as long as it doesn't bother me.
Sweets,chocolates,chips
Dust
Food. Too much of it.
From what I understand, around 1500 and 2000 but make sure you eat a varied diet and exercise 4-5 times a week for 20-30 minutes. There are some great hiit workouts on youtube, I do ones from the body coach. They're tough but they really help you lose weight and tone at the same time. Just make sure you don't cut to a stupid amount of calories like 500 because that isn't a healthy amount. Plus when you lose the weight that you want to, as soon as you start eating normally you will put it back on. Think of it as a lifestyle change instead of a diet and good luck! I hoped this helped :)
1200 per day.
i would see a dietitian and work with them
Less.
You know peeing while erect is difficult. Only you can pee easier when flaccid.
If you mean it goes back flaccid- only way you can pee is if the erection subsides.
To make it easier to pee. And yes, it is the way the nerves are connected. < M
If it went up, it would get your face wet.
"I'm 13 years old. I'm a boy. I weigh 135 pounds and I'm 5'10, I play soccer, basketball, and football. Am I overweight?" No you are not overweight at one hundred thirty five pounds, for a thirteen year old boy that also happens to play soccer, basketball, and football. At five foot ten, if anything you might be five to ten pounds underweight. But also for that age, it's not uncommon to be slightly underweight. It's not unhealthy, but a few more pounds would be healthier for you, especially since you can, and may grow more. So don't skimp on meals or calorie restrict.
No. You seem to have a normal weight. Even if you think you look heavy, that's probably from muscle if you're athletic. You sound like you're pretty healthy.
No, you're not overweight for someone your age and height :)
if you play all those sports, and at that weight, thats a healthy weight. Are you playing it for fun or for school. overweight if you were 250-300lb, and not working out.
Nope
If you can see your own ribcage you aren't overweight.
No. You are at a very healthy weight.
your weight sounds fine too me
Absolutely not.
Tennis!!!!! Honestly, I've gotten those beautiful legs from them just from playing tennis, also squats and riding your bike helps a ton
I suggest running for the most part or swimming because swimming works the whole body. If you didn't want to work the whole body you could just kick with a kick board it is very effective. Hope I could help.
fast running would help
push-ups
squats and deadlifts.
Great,most step into the lady's room and hope you survive!
You might be transgender or bigenger and that's ok be your self love your self ..... :-)
Okay. Then you might be transgender. Congrats, I guess.
Tell the truth. You just want to use the "Ladies Room", don't you.

If you are concerned by this you should have your parents make a doctor's appointment for a checkup. Show them what you have written and they can do a full physical and neurological workup. If anything troubling is discovered your test results the doctor will discuss the finding with your parents and discuss treatment options. Make sure you are eating well also. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...
You're also 15, which is a common age to be more hungry and need to eat more.
Perhaps a growth spurt?
I have the same problem :/
I wish! The left of both countries don't want that to happen as both men would introduce policies that would hinder the free-running corruption currently enjoyed by them.
Tony Abbott is not meeting Donald trump next year
I think it will go swimmingly once they can decide which asylum to hold it in; they could even invite Mao, Alexander, Caesar and a few others to make it a real leaders summit inviting Napoleon might be a bit complex.
Fine.
They will probably get along very well since they both seem to have a God complex.
DT is like an angry genetically modified potato with the DTs.
You should be drinking as much water as you can. If you have no appetite, don't eat. You can go days without food. Eat if you want to. If you end up throwing it up, no real harm is done. But keep drinking, even if you throw it up. In fact, drink more especially if you throw it up. Some will stay down. You need the fluids to restore the water lost in vomiting, to flush out toxins related to the illness to make you feel better,
You don't need to worry about food (you can literally survive weeks without it) but you absolutely must stay hydrated. So, drink water, juice, tea--anything you can keep down. Sip it but do so frequently.
Of course you have too. You can't eat anything like pizza or anything that takes too long to digest because your body needs most of the energy to fight the virus. So eat bland or soft foods. Best wishes! :)
You can try to eat something plain like a piece of toast or pretzel. If you can't keep water down, make ice cubes, hammer them into little chips and eat them like that. You should be able to keep it down and keep yourself hydrated.
Try to drink some water, just small sips, and if you feel like eating, then try something plain and simple such as soda crackers, dry toast, plain white rice.
Not necessarily. Although a bubble on your gums and pain are two symptoms of abscessed teeth. Sometimes abscesses are asymptomatic and my patients don't know they're there until I show them the xray.
Yes, you might. Or you might have swelling and pain but no obvious pus. And sometimes you might have just pain.
yes you would and it would need to be drained by a dentist
Any food can/will give you food poisoning.
you can get food poison from any type of food
you can get food poisoning from just about anything
Of course.
any food not properly refrigerated or properly heated can give you food poisioning
Yes if it is spoiled or has been left out.
I deal weight if you're female is 95 pounds. If your male it is 100 pounds.
No you are definitely not too fat at all. That is a BMI of 17.4 which is considered to be underweight.
nooooo, youre fine. completely normal
Stop being stupid.
No..you are not.
Yes you can, but if you do it naturally it will only be temporary. If you want a permanently different eye color you must undergo surgery. Hope this helped :)
You bet it is, just add food coloring. Now that I'm done trolling, no it is not. It's in your genetics.
No it isn't possible at all, there's a scientific machine that could do it but i wouldn't take the risk.
NATURALLY?? No.
No it isnt.
Oh come on!!!
My teeth are NOT yellow, but I can't say there that white either. I take good care of them. I noticed one month they looked yellower then the next month. I then realized that it reflected on my braces color. For example: White braces will make your teeth look yellow. So, what color will make my teeth look the whitest?
white braces is fine colour because it match with your teeth and if you fill that your teeth are becoming yellow then Brushing your teeth with Baking soda with the citrus of lemon juice .this solution at least once a week can give you some real effective results in whitening of teeth
I don't think it will make a difference . Choosing white braces make you look not so " ugly " because it is the closest color to the teeth color so it will not be so obvious which will make one look nicer . As you know , braces on teeth doesn't make you look nice when you smile or laugh , so it's best to make it not so obvious by choosing white .

Make sure to take the splint off and dry the finger so the skin doesn't get macerated.
Make sure that you protect the finger. Keep it close to your chest on the slide. And you should be fine. Use the free hand if you get into trouble.
possibly.
Thank you.
I'd like to say yes, but it's better than killing yourself or other methods people use. Self harming can come in many forms and is very useful to many people, however wanting to harm yourself or other people is a bad thing, has you can end up killing yourself or somebody else, even if it's by accident. They're many other methods if you want to release pent up emotions, Listening to music, Drawing, Singing, Running, Boxing (Or any sport) and simple things like just screaming, yano letting it all out. You can look up many things that work just the same as self harm, all you need to do is search it up on the internet
Yes
Self harming can be a way to alleviate pain but it's not a healthy way to do so. Practice mindfulness and good cooping skills.
Yes.
Depends on how hard you get hit. I once whacked my head on the hatch of a hatchback car. I don't remember the next day. The day after I was confused because I thought it was the wrong day. Strangely, on the day I don't remember I had gone to work as usual and managed my usual duties just fine. Apparently the concussion did not hurt my reasoning just my memory formation for that day.
It depends on how hard the back of your skull has been hit. If it didn't get hit badly, then you will more than likely be fine, maybe just a minor concussion. But if you hit it hard, you might want to see a doctor. A severe concussion can mess with your eyesight and a lot of other things.
It depends on how hard and y is someone punching u in the head? I pass out and but my head daily but at this pint I'm use to it but I'm constantly my dizzy room is always spinning had brain mri tommorrow
Someone goes to jail or prison depending on the severity of the injury, I guess.
it would give you a concussion, basically a damage of the brain. This will most commonly affect your balance and coordination (long term) and nausea and vomiting(short term)
You will grab the back of your head and cry, that's gotta hurt !
Your head jerks forward
You get a bad headache
concussion, eyes pop out of skull, bite your tongue off, bleed to death, paralysis
Outside?
Outside works for most people. You can walk or run to a park, do squats, pushups, etc. there, and return. I live where there's real winter and I see people work out outdoors all year long.
yes, the gym is the best place to workout because you don,t have any other option.
Actually, there is no chance except Gym. Hit the gym, it is the best place to workout.
pushups situps squats pullups dips calf raises
how about your basement
Everyone has those fantasies. I think we understand they are just that and others have a right to live and be respected. It is a matter of self control and knowing we are all struggling for the same things. We have no right to hurt other for perceived wrongs.
Few of us are truly mentally healthy. Envy is one of the seven deadly sins because it can lead to dreadful violence if unchecked. But at least you recognize you have a problem. This is the first step to resolving it. I suggest talking honestly to a local priest or pastor, or a doctor.
You should stop watching TV shows, movies, reading books or playing video games that feature violence. I think you'll find that your thoughts will improve.
Turn yourself into the authorities immediately. Tell them to keep you locked up for at least 15 years.
Sentence again !!!!! Illegitimate desire is the root cause for your anxiety. Try to reduce the size of your worries and anxieties, so that it reduces the level of your present mental confusion.
Your drunk go home
Hi i am a 14 year old male. So basically, i dont think i can orgasm. I feel pleasure, and i first felt this when i was around 7-8 when my penis rubbed against something. I started to rub my penis against my arm and watched porn around 11 and i felt relief or pleasure, but no liquid came out. I tried to masturbate normal and ended up peeing. This is embarrasing so pls be gentle. Am i old enough?
You're confusing orgasm with ejaculation. Kids are capable of experiencing orgasms right from a young age. Obviously, without semen, they are known as dry orgasms. Wet ones is when you have liquid exit your penis, and because both occur simultaneously, for most guys they are synonymous. Instead of worrying about it (and I think it will be soon, anyhow) focus on learning different techniques - explore things, play around, discover your erogenous zones, etc. So you don't fall into the habit of just doing the same-old way all the time.
Well relax. If you get the feeling and nothing comes out this is fine. Your body just isn't ready to do that yet. You will however in near future start ejaculating. In the meantime you get all the feelings with none of the mess to clean up.
wait a year and try again
Farmers market
Fish, rice chips, they have different flavors. Salad get fat free dressing. Fat free or low fat yogurt. Pretzels. Bananas, carrots no dip. Sherbet instead of ice cream.
Less. Nor what, but how much. Try monitoring your fiber. The rest will follow. 30g/day.
I understand the feeling of being so annoyed with everyone that you want to kill them. If you're absolutely serious about these thoughts see a therapist, or a school counselor. If you talk about this to someone they can help you and you can get these feelings and thoughts out if your head.
Daydreaming doesn't make you crazy it probably means you're a critical thinker. If you want to kill your mother every time they criticize you then you need to get the **** over yourself sounds like you just can't handle criticism(please don't kill me). You need to calm down, in general, be more mellow about life and stop caring so much especially when what people do doesn't affect you. You're not crazy you're just easily angered try playing games like "league of legends" for a while until you can handle people telling you to "Kill yourself" constantly and other generally mean things.
You're 13. No one cares what you think and it has absolutely zero impact on the world. You don;t know what a hallucination is and how on earth would you drown someone in their sleep? Wouldn't they wake up while you were dragging them to the bathtub?
Troll
See a therapist
If you're going to kill someone, start with the person in the mirror.
Youre a sociopath in the making.get help asap and give me thumbs up
I have been feeling depressed for quite some time and it s gotten to the point where it is very bad and I can t function and do simple daily tasks. I have many panic attacks and I am always trying to think of different ways to kill myself. I ve tried many times before and I need to get help. I m just scared because I don t know what will happen to me. What s it like in the hospital? How long will I be there? How do I deal with my parents making me feel bad for trying to get help?
I have been in the psychiatric ward of a hospital several times. It was always a good and helpful and healing experience. There is group therapy and community meetings and individual talks with your psychiatrist. It helps to be there with people who know what you are going through. You will stay there until you are no longer a danger to yourself. If you go, be 100% honest with the staff. They need to know all the information in order to help you.
People who have the flu often feel some or all of these symptoms: Fever* or feeling feverish/chills. Cough. Sore throat. Runny or stuffy nose. Muscle or body aches. Headaches. Fatigue (tiredness) Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.
when i have a cold i eat a small piece of garlic & i take a Zinc vitamin . Garlic is a natural antibiotic & zinc is very good to boost your immune system. VERY important when you feel better , clean your home very well to degerm it especialy your bedding and pillow , washing your bedding is A MUST to degerm it. go outside a lil while fresh air helps me . , i hope this helps, god bless
"A Cold". Drink hot liquids and suck on some throat drops. Eat a spoonful of Honey, 3 times a day. Have some Hot chicken soup, and take some ibuprofen.
Sounds like sinus infection and strep throat.
Sounds like a flu and swollen throat glands to me. Go to your doctor and get antibiotics.
Possible teeth infection,sinus infection and sore throat.See a Dentist.
Sounds like a cold or sinus infection.
If it's in the middle of the night go to the er especially if ur Tempature is over 102.1
No one here can diagnose you over the internet. Get yourself to a doctor.
you have a cold and you need loads of liquid and sleep
likely done since you are 15- nearly all guys done by then. Huge size, top 5%
I have a little secret which is that I am a player. I love to satisfy each and every beautiful lady I meet but for that I have to keep my man on its toes. These Prolargentsize pills have enlarged the girth and the size of my penis.
what is the point of asking it wont make it grow any larger or shrink it will it.. and since there is nothing other than cosmetic surgery that affect the size of a penis anyway theres seems little point in asking whether its big or small
You want to hear appraisals? Not from me... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
My opinion is you have a very big penis.
First of all, women almost never orgasm from penetration alone, so try to stimulate your clitorus if you haven't already. If you enjoy penetration, try to use lube, being comfortable is key. On the note of staying comfortable, make sure no one is going to interrupt you, and give yourself loads of time, don't rush it. If you're still having trouble, try tensing and relaxing your Kegels (the muscles you use when stopping your pee) while stimulating your clitorus, working these muscles will enhance the sensations. Good luck and have fun!
try using a hair brush, markers, electric toothbrush, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, try find your moms dildo/vib when she is not home and have a great orgasm from that
Gently rub your clitoris in small circles until you orgasm. Do not insert anything into your vagina
damn racist
My kung fu teacher is a so called "Ching chong" and would like to give you a free demonstration.
Are you asking a question or just venting
racist and stupid, the most 2 common elements of caucasians.
What you did is considered felony animal abuse in some areas, for the same reasons Eve related. Your dog doesn't have the presence of mind to consent to a sexual act. Besides that, watching sicko porn is doing something bad to you spiritually - not religiously, but it's shaking how you think of yourself. Why not watch other weird videos that aren't porn? http://play-if-you-dare.com/ is a good site for it.
This is like the SpongeBob episode where he clocks in a minute late. If your boyfriend doesn't consider it cheating, then let that settle it. You don't need to be punished. I'll admit it's really weird but you don't need to be killed or something. Just don't do it again. People have done worse things like oh well... screw your best friend.
You won't believe this, so look it up. The human anus can stretch out, 9 to 11 inches with training. Why anyone would want to find that out, I DON'T KNOW, but some porn stars make a BUNCH of money for it AND THEY ARE MEN. Just because I know this, does not make me gay or interested. I know how to spend A BUNCH of money, but I'm not a millionaire.
Anuses can stretch a lot. A penis can penetrate well if your aroused. I didn't think I could do it either but someone I did it with just put it in and it didn't hurt that much. Depending on the positions and how fast you go sometimes hard affects it of course
Everyone has a choice.And if you're not into that sort of stuff just yet, then don't do it.You're allowed to say no! And if you're partner truly loves you then they will understand and won't pressure you into doing so.If you are into it, then be safe, get your partner to wear a condom and use lube and ask to be gentle if this is your first time.
You need to build up to this gradually, use a small bu*tplug and lubrication to start with, increase the size over a period of time until you feel comfortable. Never ever just go straight to it, take your time and only say yes when you're ready.
Anal is okay as long as the guy knows what he is doing. It can be pleasureful for you both. Make sure you use lube or saliva. Make sure he puts it in slowly, a little at a time and make sure he pays attention to how your feeling. DO NOT rush it and try to put it in too fast. Good luck! Hope you enjoy it!
Everyone's butt is too small to start with. It takes patience, training and time to really be able to do it.
If you want to try it , go for it! As long as he is gentle and you use lots of lube, you will probably really enjoy it! It's similar to normal sex ~ you can orgasm lots during anal.Remember though once he her put his penis in your ***, he must not go back in your vagina until he has washed his penis or you'll get thrush because of the bacteria from your *** will cause problems in your vagina. Most importantly ~ relax and take your time, enjoy!
So what? Use whatever works for you. Why do you feel the need to ask for permission from total strangers?
Thats pretty sad. Most guys can masturbate normally without ever using any type of lube. It just isn't necessary.
Yes fairly normal. We all have our thing and that's yours.
Sex...seriously burns 100's of calories, water, walking, eating salads, and foods that make you go pooo. And no I'm not kidding. I stay the same weight because I eat the same things almost everyday. I rarely change my diet. :)
Quit drinking soda pop.
It'll probably be out of your system within a week, maybe two. However, depending on your metabolism, it has been found in a person's system for up to a month after the last use, for frequent/daily users.
Assuming you are talking about smoking, if they do find any the amounts would be so low you can blame passive smoking. Say you were in a shop queue or something. That would also explain it being in your hair.
This is news to me, I've been a coffee drinker all my life and never noticed anything like this.
Coffee benefits? See: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/coffee & http://theoatmeal.com/tag/coffee funny and informative
Caffeine is a stimulant.
Caffeine, I do the same.
I'm not going to sit here and end a life. The truth is, there's no "painless" way. It's going to be painful no matter what. Have faith in yourself. Things get better. I've been there, and trust me, it's not easy. BUT IT WILL GET BETTER.
you are not alone these days.....how old are you? teens get, TEEN ANGST, you are trying to make sense of an insane world and of course that would drive you nuts if you have no perspective.....seriously go see a couselor....you'll likely be the millionth teen to have the same complaint....you are normal, believe it or not
Ask a dr. to prescribe Zoloft. It works every time.
ah poor child, take 10 miligrams of melatonin, you will die peacefully and painlessly in your sleep, like a soothing lullaby
Most people don't label them junkies. But healthy and fit isn't really the measure. It's a question of life functioning and addiction. And yes, it is addicting, psychologically. If you are willing to risk jail time, your job, etc., then you have a problem. If using keeps you from working, focusing at school, doing stuff with your life, you have a problem. By the way, any smoke inhaled into your lungs is bad because you are replacing oxygen with other substances that can adversely affect you. I don't have a problem with occasional users. But a lot of users are deluding themselves when they use all the time, risk job, risk jail, risk family, risk health. (Same as for drinking.)
They're not labeled junkies - I've never heard it. Pretty soon this will be perfectly legal and you'll have a joint instead of some sickening beer in the evening. Let the morons drink their beer and get sick and fat.
It's name calling by the supporters of a system that only allows recreational use of alcohol and tobacco. There is too much money in those things to allow new competition.
You are still a junkie! You just have a different definition of what you think a junkie is.
Why do you feel that junkies can't be healthy and fit? Alcoholics can also be healthy and fit? Both are slowly roting their brains.
Same here. Take a trip to Manitou Springs, Co you'll see why.
After you get bored with pot, then what? Something STRONGER? CAN YOU LIVE without pot? Guys can destroy testosterone and grow breasts with "heavy" usage. The trick is to define "heavy". A weekend smoke is one thing, but 3-4 a day I would think is overdoing it. I don't smoke, tho'...
That's an old government promoted bit pf propaganda back when pot was being damned as pure evil. One laughs.
I have never heard that term used for anybody that uses weed.
Too much is going on in my life and it is causing me to question my existence. Please don't say volunteer, I do that already. My roommates hate me I get harassed by groups of teens daily and I am an adult. My brother is very codependent and it's ruining my life. I have erectile dysfunction and I am a 32 year old virgin I feel extremely isolated I am quite poor Women aren't interested in me I have a poor memory I oversleep and I like to stay in bed half the day. The world isn't what I want it to be (normal, safe)
Ok, good to know. Do you have a Mens Health question kid?
Wrong category you should be in mental health
DON'T Self Harm...you are doing yourself NO good.
A piece of wire A piece of broken glass A cigarette lighter A razor blade A needle A pliers A chemical like acid or corrosive A gun
If you really wanted to harm yourself, it seems highly unlikely you would need to ask anyone else such a question.
No one is going to give you that answer, because it's the wrong thing to do.
If you truly wanted to hurt yourself, you would already know how.
Shoot yourself in the crotch
YES. You should be enjoying your life, finishing school working towards a college degree, getting married and THEN having kids.
No, but perhaps a little stupid. It's okay to want a kid, but to have one...
it's called stupidity so yes.
No. You are simply misguided, niave, and very stupid.
Not really
No just stupid.
I don't know if you would be considered to be a douche. I know that it is something that some couples try, and it can be arousing for some. I will confess that my husband did it once when we were boyfriend and girlfriend years ago. Here's a link to the topic for further reading. https://www.buzzfeed.com/caseygueren/let...
I suspect many people already consider you a douche...
Uhm yes. Unless you ask the girl and she says she wants you to. Otherwise don't ******* do that.
That's... that's kinda disgusting and very unhygienic. So yeah, probably.
yes
Yes you would .
yes, I would think so.
yes, you will give her a ******* infection ???
no it wouldn't
that is gross
Yolo
People realize that he is mentally ill, they are just deeply in denial. He needs professional help
Because I've been ejaculating too quickly lately with my girlfriend I withheld on masturbating for 6 weeks now. And I just got a random erection. I had one earlier today but I just had to be. I just got another one. And I don't have to be. And I'm in class. And class don't end until 15 mins. And although it didn't get created by sexual thoughts the tgrill of being like this in a public place is turning me on even more. I'm wearing a jacket but it still won't hide it completely if I'm walking. I need help
Waiting long periods between ejaculating will cause you to fire off quickly. Better to masturbate at least daily so you won't fire off so quickly. Just did the opposite of what you should do to help with premature ejaculation.
These Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pills work well. my husband usually comes home from work and complains that he is too tired for anything . but in the last week these have been helping lot. He wants to have fun every night and is now bugging me to have sex.
Hi so look up the squeeze method on the internet and improve your girl friends enjoyment of sex. it will also do wonders for your relationship.
Every time I have sweet tea, Starbucks, chocolate milk, or any type of drink basically besides water - I have gas and diarrhea. It s also other things like certain foods such as desserts, candy, and sweet things. Could it be the sugar? because everything has sugar and not everything hurts my stomach. If anyone has any ideas please help. Thanks!!
Your stomach might have a problem with full cream milk. Speak with your GP and ask for a lactose test.
The problem you have is not related to "food and drink", it's a medical problem and you need to see a doctor.
See an intestine physiologist
try to take some antibiotics. i had the same problems and the doctor said there is some bacteria and it fixed.
you may be lactose intolerant. the issue may be with dairy products, not sugar. However, consult a doctor.
see an hio method chiropractor.
Hello guys I have a really scary problem. I was shaving the underside of my penis and I cut myself really close to the vein that runs up your penis, now it looks like it is empty, there is a bright line from my scrotum to the cut and the vein from the cut to the head of the penis looks like it is empty. Also, the down side of the penis is pretty red and it looks like there is no blood or something. The bleeding stopped but it is all really scary, please tell me what is happening. Thanks.
It's probably nothing to worry about. It's like any other cut in the skin...only skin deep. IF it is deeper, then you should see a doctor.
Why were you shaving your penis? don't do that.
Youll be fine. I'm sure you've had other Cuts before bro.
I've done this a few times. Can hurt pretty bad, but it will heal fairly fast. You're fine.
Do not worry , apply some shaving lotion and talcum powder. It will heal in no time. Enjoy hairless cock. Regards.
shaving is silly
Well.... Don't do that.
don;t shave obviously
So, me And my girl had sex right. Few seconds in and we used a condom. So, she had a somewhat period she said that was light like aa week or 2 later and I was like YESSS so she isn t prego. But now her period isn t coming as it should. It s late. So I m wondering, if loosing your virginity can throw your period off like that.
No, having sex cannot change the menstrual cycle. A person doesn't lose anything when they first have sex and it doesn't change their body at all - virginity is a social concept, not a physical state of being and the body can't tell the difference between arousal via sex or arousal via masturbation or just plain arousal. The menstrual cycle is controlled by hormonal changes in reproductive organs, sex has no effect on this what-so-ever unless pregnancy occurs.
No, but many things can throw your period off, like stress, diet, medication. Many people just always have an irregular period for no reason, and it's more common if you're young.
*losing. Many things can affect a woman's cycle.
First of I am truly sorry for your parents deaths bro:( But don't end your life. Your brothers and sisters need you more then anything right now! Think of it. They already lost their parents and now they can't lose you! You will get through it man. It takes some time though.
Please dont end your life. Your brother and sisters need you. They just went through losing both parents I highly doubt they can handle losing a sibling. Talk to someone, anyone. A teacher, a friend, your uncle, etc.
Hey I a weird bump on my upper leg, right the elevation of my pubic area. It's not really near my penis. I'd say it's in the middle of my upper leg. You cant really see it but I can feel it. Whenever I squish It hurts a little bit but not a whole much. Please help I'm kinda freaking out right now. If I had a tumor would it be curable?
That's either a cyst or an enlarge lymph node. Neither one is a crisis.
Sounds like either a lipoma (harmless lump offat) or a swollen lymph node (sign that a healthy immune system is fighting an infection) See a doctor and get an actual diagnosis. If it is an infection you might need treatnent.
It is not a tumor. Go see a doctor.

Hello, I think an inguinal hernia is a lot more likely, as an explanation.
No one get a tumour on their leg, it's sounds like a fatty cyst.
I'm a 15 year old male and well it was 1am at night and I was in my room doing my thing and my bed is kinda squeaky but in the moment I didn't quite notice. So all of a sudden my mom opened my door and looked directly at me and asked if I could keep it down while I was masturbating. Do this seem weird to anyone or is it normal?
Well masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. She acknowledged that you were masturbating and she clearly doesn't have a problem with that however you were making too much noise and she was either trying to sleep etc. NORMAL.
All parents know it, specially your dad coz hes been through that thing and of course he'll tell it to your mom. Your mom will understand it and not a big deal.
It is normal . Every parents know that their sons do masturbate. You behave as if nothing happened and enjoy. Regards.
All parents know their teen boys are masturbating, not surprising. Your dad especially knows you are doing it, and will generally tell your mother since guys can't keep secrets.
It's normal but a little embarrassing
Most parents know that guys do that. They just don't want to know when you are actually doing it.
I'm sure you don't want to hear the sounds of your mom having sex. She doesn't want to hear you either.
No, it's weird he keeps on posting about it.
its weird that she said something, but every mom knows their 15 year old son is whacking it.. like every day...
Anywhere between 100 and 120 pounds would be average.
About 100 pounds for your age and height.
115 lbs
google it yourself
You have a nice big size. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches and you could continue to grow until your in your late teens to early twenties.
what does it matter whether its good or bad. for 12 or 70 year old, its pointless to ask such troll like questions , since there is nothing other can cosmetic surgery than can alter the size of a penis
Yes, that is very good.

I am a reiki master, crystal healing therapist, angel therapy practitioner, and life coach in Vancouver, BC Canada. I specialize in spiritual healing & personal development. And I was wondering what kind of training or certificate do I need to be able to certify others in reiki or crystal healing if I want to make my own lectures and certify people level by level. Any advice for supplies I need to certify other people (in Canada specifically) would be great!
If you are Reiki level 3 you can train others. I don't believe there is a certifying body for crystals.
You have obtained discredited credentials that are mastered on subjects that lack empirical evidence, objective data and cogent reasoning. Maybe you should get a job as a mystic on a traveling fairground.
It's all quackery.
Just make one up, like you make the rest of the crap you "practice" up.
Your genitals are not a place to put aftershave which contains a high proportion of alcohol. This is why it burns. Wash off any remaining aftershave with soap and water. Put up with any remaining burning feeling, which will subside shortly. The aftershave will NOT have affected your ability to have kids. It is better not to shave the pubes but, if they are too long or thick, to simply trim them.
No it won't effect anything. The burn you felt is normal as the alcohol in the aftershave causes that.
Nothing happens. You take after shave lotion in a dish and make it diluted in water and apply, the burning will be less. Later you will like the burning sensation after shaving the pubes. ENJOY my friend a hairless cock.
No, won't harm your sperm you don't produce until 10 or 15 years from now.
Lol bruh you're in big trouble xD I think it's a sign of a broken pee pee
you do shave it and think to have children?
Why would you do this??!!! This has serious trauma to your ability to reproduce! Go to a doctor immediately!
Teachers can be idiots sometimes. She sounds like she genuinely cares, though. I think that you should talk to her. Who knows? She might be able to help. And you aren't an attention whore. She's the one that asked about it.
You aren't being an attention whore. You need to speak to someone about what is on your mind, that is all. If you feel comfortable, then do so. It is completely normal and helpful.
You shouldn't lose more than 1% of your body weight a week so for you that'd be 1.9 pounds a week. Anything more than that and you risk losing lean muscle and it's not walk in the park to get back. Keep in mind that weight loss isn't linear and all you need to lose weight is a calorie deficit.
June 4th is only three weeks away. 2-3lbs a week doesn't quite add up to 15lbs.
fats
than go for it
I'm 5'1 and 220 pounds.... I've struggled with eating for nearly three years now. I've tried to lose weight the healthy way and it never works, ever. So I began starving myself and eventually lost 40 pounds only to gain it back and more. Idek I'm so tired of being fat and I'm so tired of starving myself. Idek what to do
Starving yourself is not healthy. Not only that, it slows your metabolism and makes you lose weight slower. Your body goes into starvation mode and conserves calories. Eating several small, healthy meals a day keep your metabolism at a good, fast rate. Eat protein and ditch the sugar and processed foods. Also, exercise will help speed things up to. It doesn't have to be drastic but start with a 15 minute walk a day going the speed your body will allow. Good luck on your journey.
you need a proper nutrition your diet can not have no foods in your body when you starve yourself your body hold on to what it has in the body and feeds on that and i'll only end it more weight gain and fat cells in the body a proper nutrion plan and exercise will change all that and irs not even hard take a little time out of your day to be a better healthier you there's no losing with that. I am a fitness model, Trainer and nutritionist. if your really serious about it check out my website detroithealthandfitness.com
well when you do crash dieting you're something like 90% guaranteed you will gain it back. Losing weight is simple, it's not easy but it's simple. You need to be burning more calories than you're eating on a daily basis. I recommend keeping a log of what you eat so you know how much you're eating and not going over. To speed up the process you should begin exercising. You won't lose weight as fast as starving yourself but it's healthy and your chances of keeping it off are much higher. You gotta make a serious lifestyle change if you're serious about this. hope it works out, good luck.
It will take time to lose weight visibly. Starving yourself is BAD. You need to keep a steady diet of about 2250 calories a day and exercise, preferably cardio. Good luck! And don't give up
People often correlate chest pain with blockages in arteries in the heart, and in older patients that is a common cause. In younger patients a few things that can cause chest pain include anxiety/stress, chest wall pain caused by inflammation, or an abnormal heart rhythm. You need to see about being referred to a specialist to see if they can try to figure out what is going on with you. Most of the time, it isn t anything serious in someone young & otherwise healthy, but definitely worth seeing a cardiologist about!
Far and away the most common causes of chest pain in teenagers/young adults are: muscular, anxiety, idiopathic (precordial catch). None of which is serious. Chances of you having a serious heart issue are pretty much non existent unless you have had a heart transplant, are a Class A drug user, you have FHC, or you have a serious connective tissue disease such as Marfans or Sickle Cell. (In most places, a normal chest x-ray, normal blood results and normal ECG = a healthy heart).
Make an appointment with your doctor and tell him that it's been 5 years, and you'd like to go for a complete cardiac workup. Let him send you to a cardiologist so you can get the though of something serious out of your head.
Chest pain in teens is common. Rarely is it heart related, usually gas or anxiety. Anxiety often causes chest pain, people think they're having a heart attack. You should try anti anxiety meds, see if you get any chest pain.
5 years means it is almost certainly NOT cardiac. It almost certainly IS anxiety related, but I can't believe the doctors have let you go on untreated. Anxiety can wreck you life and make you feel sick, weak, shaky, dizzy and full of pains each day. I have had palpitations that have lasted for days on end, happening almost every hour--all from anxiety. They gave me beta blockers which help.
Take CHINESE HERBS!!! I'm 18, and I used to have the same pain. Ever since I've taken them, it has gone away. They balance the Yin and Yang, balance the heart, kidneys, and livers. They have been using them naturally for years
do nothing and say it's a bruise
Waterproof bandaid
If you reallly care about it, just bring a white shirt. they can't Force you to take it off.
Waterproof make up
No. Rinse and swish with mouthwash.
no. even if you use the kind without alcohol, it's not meant to be consumed in large amounts. the little bit of mouth wash that remains in your mouth when you rinse and spit is alright to swallow, but you shouldn't straight up drink it like you would with a normal drink.
no not very much of it. what you swallow during use of mouth wash is not much, but drinking it will play hell with your body.
depends on how much you swallow. more than whats left in your mouth after you rinse with it can be harmful...
Lifting weights at 13 isn't the best idea because you're still developing. But that doesn't mean you're TOO young. Maybe starting next year you can start that. But anyone can be exercising in a way that suits their body and energy levels. Walking, jogging, swimming, yoga, all that is important and keeps you healthy and active. You will not remain short, I don't know where they got that from. Your height is coded in your genetic structure.
Heavy weight lifting does stunt your growth if you're still growing. 16 is generally the youngest accepted age to start. If you want to lift, just do what girls do. High rep, low weight. Body weight exercises are also okay.
Weights will stunt your growth, yes. Cardio activities, like walking, jogging, or swimming, are good for you and will not stunt your growth. You should wait a few years before lifting Have you ever seen those female gymnasts? They are all very short. That's because gymnastics is SUCH a hard activity. It stunts their growth.
yes - short stature decrease risk of 'venous insufficiency' source : 'tall' in http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/... - shorter stature, is more resistant against cancer, diabetes, aging source : 'resistant to cancer and diabetes and are somewhat protected against aging.[6][12][13] This is consistent with findings in mice with a defective growth hormone receptor gene.[7]' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laron_synd... - shorter stature need lower blood pressure to stay alive, lower blood pressure is healthier source : 'Because smaller animals (for example rats) function at a lower blood pressure, they need less oncotic pressure to balance this, and thus need less albumin to maintain proper fluid distribution.' in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serum_albu...

there is NO excuse. go to bed earlier. get an alarm clock. Accept the rules of Reality.

It can put you at a higher risk and that is why you get checked regularly after the first cancer is cured - my dad had lung cancer and recovered but died 3 years later of stomach cancer but he was 76 years old. My sister had breast cancer and recovered and 6 years later she is still free of cancer but gets yearly checkups, Good Luck
Usually not the cancer itself, but radiation and chemotherapy treatments make a person more susceptible to developing another type of cancer.
No, but you still have the same risk of different cancers.
Nope
Not really. My father didn't.
I've heard that smoking causes heart disease. I understand lung cancer is caused by mutations the genetic code of structures such as the alveoli, but I'm not too clear on how smoking may contribute to heart disease. Of course, as a stimulant that taxes the heart and lungs, nicotine may not exactly be the most healthful thing affecting the cardiovascular system, but no one blames caffeine for their cardiovascular maladies. What's the deal with smokes and heart disease?
Ever notice the bluish haze that builds up on a smoker's car windshield? That's tar and nicotine, and the same stuff builds up in the lungs. The body is a resilient marvel, able to take care of itself. But eventually, the chemicals are going to cause damage that it can't repair. The chemicals from smoking get into the bloodstream, turning it acidic - the ideal environment for diseases to develop. Heart disease and lung cancer are just two of the problems associated with smoking that are usually fatal.
It hardens the arteries, making the passage of the blood alot harder to travel...this is one of the reasons why heart patients take aspirin, since aspirin thins the blood, and allows it to pass through those hardened arteries... My father died of CHD (Coronary Heart Disease) and he was an otherwise healthy man...He had an angina attack and 2 heart attacks...2 of his arteries were severely hardened and clogged...His cholesterol was normal as was his blood pressure and everything else...so what caused it? According to doctors it was his smoking! If you are or know a smoker, learn from others' tragedies.
The medical establishment doesn't know an exact answer. What they do know is there is a very strong link between smoking and the buildup of plaque in arteries. The more you smoke in a day, the more quickly the buildup happens. And if you reduce the level of smoking the buildup rate changes at the same degree you change your smoking habits. It is that proven link between smoking and plaque in the arteries that concerns doctors. And when plaque plugs an artery you have a heart attack or stroke.
I agree with the other response. Seems to have started right when you became a teenager. You won't have the comforts of depending on your mom & living care free anymore.

NONE! All those simple carbs convert to sugar (glucose) one their digested. IF you had to pick a "best of the worst" it would be whole grain bread. That's Whole GRAIN, not whole WHEAT. But it will still be wheat bread.
probably just mild eczema, or maybe you get shampoo or soap in it and do not rinse it out well, which is drying or irritating it. next time you go to a doctor, mention it. a tiny amount, and I mean a tiny amount, of hydrocortisone cream, available at a pharmacy without prescription, can help but use sparingly. a fungus would be an ongoing thing, not this sporadic. itchy ears are not a cause of hearing loss.
It's nothing. My ear itches too. Don't look up your symptoms. The internet will tell you that you have everything from yellow fever to lung cancer.
It usually just means that you need to clean your ears out more. Same thing happened to me. Clean them out know and regularly and it shouldn't happen
if it bothers you see a doctor
Yes, but whether he was an honorable man or not, God tells us to honor our father and our mother so our lives will be long upon this earth. You honor your parents for giving you life, if you cannot find any other reason. You must also forgive your parents or anyone else. Unforgiveness leads to bitterness and then destruction of the body sets in. We forgive for ourselves. We honor for ourselves. God set these rules and when we don't follow them our bodies will suffer. They cause a chemical imbalance because the wages of sin is death.
He was honorable at lying and playing around with other people's feelings, he's also honorable at hurting other people and making sure that nobody tells on him. The most honorable mention is when anyone tries to be honest, he cries and says he doesn't want to start any trouble even though he was the reason why things started up. One of his last honorable mentions was making my mothers life horrible for 30+ years, making her stay inside and wouldn't allow her to talk to ANYONE. That's really it.
Not particularly. He was around till I was 10 then he kept cheating and my mom kicked him out. I remember him crying and rolling on the floor...he was a habitual liar and sometimes ripped people off in business. He also was really cheap, he had extra money from his job and his hobbies but he never shared it with me and my mom. I haven't seen him since I was about 20. I don't hate him or anything but he's not getting Father of the Year. At least he didn't abuse me.
Yes
My father was better than honorable; he was a good man.
No my dad remonstrated his authority in a physical way against me from a young age coupled with always speaking like a child (I don't know why) has ****** me up completely. He also admitted the only reason he had a child was due to the fact that he was incapacitated from working and needed to get some extra income definitely offered some clarity in what he said there, which also explains the reason why he speaks down at me; which also coincides as to why I avoid all contact with him.
Yes he WAS an honorable man all the way up till he hit 58 then he became rather pathetic.
Yes. This condition often leads to making the sufferer induce vomiting. So even if they eat, they 'bring it back'.
Yes! Anorexia is a mental disorder where the patient sees themselves as fat and become addicted to how many calories they consume in a day !
Yes, people who don't eat are called corpses.
no there not
Nothing to worry about, partner recently had a high count but when new doctor checked back on his medical history it seems it has been high for past 20 years or so and just soemthing that can happen, he doesnt get a lot of sleep due to nightshift work and is diabetic.
You are an anxious Mum as many of us were and are. Lack of sleep and worry about the baby. I went down with everything in the first 6 months. High white cells are due to infection, you now have sinus problems, hives are due to allergies, the tingling is most probably coming from nerve restriction in your neck and shoulders from picking up and carrying the baby. Calm down, relax, have a glass of wine and enjoy your baby, life will improve. UK
13,000 is not abnormally high. The normal range is 4500 to 10,000. Your body is dealing with an infection. Yes, you have anxiety, which shows in your repeated doctor visits. As your doctor to refer to you counseling so that you can cope better with life rather than to run to the doctor all the time, assuming you have cancer.
Yes any form of inflamation or infection can cause a high wbc.
Could be reason but i think your overly anxious. Google wbc see what norm is.
Do you know its hayfever? Only by getting a test done from docs can tell you this - millions of people wrongly self diagnose themselves with this and its something different. So see a doc to ensure its this and ask for a prescription - usually tablets, an nose inhaler, medicine or jag.
depends what kind of hay fever?
pretty much any off the shelf allergy medicine
eat a lot of junk food a lof sweets. like donuts, honey buns. u can eat a lot of chips too and drink hawaiian punch with that.a lot of fast food like mcdonalds.
Eat anything you find in your fridge. Then go watch tv for hours while doing nothing.
Smoke weed and eat a lot

No, tall guys are often longer than their beds and so sleep with their knees bent.
No, your bed will not stunt your growth.
Yes, it will totally ruin your life and you'll be a miserable wreck for many many years. LMAO
Maybe you're built backwards: does your nose run and your feet smell?
Yes. Tell your parents right away.
LOL. What other things you have on mind? healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
It has nothing to do with you. The dudes probably have some sort of problem with sexual functions. Some guys just can't get off. I remember it used to be really hard for me but now I'm fine. Just depends. Not you prob though. 1 wouldn't worry.
Perhaps solo counseling for your insecurities and couples counseling to learn why your husband doesn't desire sex. It may be that he just doesn't want it with anyone. Either way (whether it's an issue with you or lack of desire for sex in general) you need to decide if you want to stay, if you two can't figure out what the issue is and resolve it. A sexually unsatisfying marriage isn't a very happy marriage, even if you do gain confidence and self esteem.
Your basic problem is that your husband cannot maintain an erection, and the man with whom you cheated couldn't maintain one either. Obviously you are looking for men in the wrong place. Why not try college students, or maybe men from a different country? Or ask some of your friends where they find THEIR men. Another way to go is to find a masochist, tie him up then give him a good thrashing. If he doesn't get an erection, then just beat him senseless. At least you can get some satisfaction from that!
It is due to poor and weak mental health. It happens if you continuously neglect your mental health. You should not be careless about your mental health. Always try to maintain perfect mental health conditions to avoid such pitfalls in life. Don't ignore it altogether in future.
This is difficult to answer, not knowing 100% of the details. I'd suggest you find ways to focus on other aspects of your life. And while it's cliche` to say: "Sex isn't everything", I know it's not, but it is something. I suggest you simply find ways to feel good about yourself. Find meaningful volunteer opportunities, take leadership roles. Tout your charm, tout your brains, and who knows what that might bring?
Try marital couples counseling and you yourself 1 on 1 individual therapy and work on your issues.
it's possible that your husband has a low libido or erectile dysfunction and your extra circular was just feeling pressure to preform if you tell your husband about your affair (witch you should do anyway) it might motivate him to seek help
It may be because you are insecure. Learn to be secure with yourself, and don't go for those guys who aren't interested in you. You got to love yourself first, before any guy is going to love you . From the sounds of it, your husband doesn't if he's not willing to help in the sex department.
Dental schools often have income based fee schedules that allow people making less money to pay less for their services. There are free clinics that do dental work in most areas. If you have gum disease to the point that you are losing teeth I assume you need scaling and root planing ('deep cleaning') which can be done cheaper if you go to a hygeinist school and let them learn on you. You can see if you qualify for Medicaid which typically has a dental component to it and then find a dentist that accepts it. Some dental offices allow for payment plans or can sign you up for financing (like a credit card) to help patients afford their treatment.
You can't. Without insurance you will have to pay every penny of the total cost of your dental work before a dentist will touch even a single instrument to your teeth. So, enjoy your one way trip to toothlessness :)
apply for care credit so you can pay it off monthly instead of all at once, or have the work done at a dental school since they charge a reduced rate
You absolutely should leave him now. Do not marry this man. Would you want any children you might have to be treated the way he treats you? He will never change for the better, only for the worse. Many women who are physically abused will be killed by their abuser. Leave him. If you have to stay in a shelter for a little while, so be it. You are strong, you can do this.
so? what is so wrong about it? You should try masturbating...
She wants you to masturbate for her
it's perfectly normal. 90+% of guys do the same thing
If she shared that with you its an offer of some kind.
It's not wrong.
I'm 12 years old and evertime I erect my penis bends downwards. I dont feel pain when this happens so meaning its not the foreskin's fault right? I do alot of masturbating when i was 10 or 12, I know tit sounds silyl but could this be the reason why I have this? I searched about this in the internet and only adults experience it, so mine could be different right?Please answer.
No, you arent different. It's not an adult thing. Most all penises have some degree of bend or curvature to them. In boys and men. And it has nothing to do with masturbation.
No this is just the way your body is. It is a common misconception that the penis is straight when erect. Many men have penis' that will go in odd angles when erect. Some point down like yours, some go left or right, some straight up, some I've seen have been bent in an L shape. The average guy's penis will have a slight upward curve of the penis, much like a banana, but for the not so average or above average, they have what you have.
An overall curve in the penis is perfectly normal as very few penises are completely straight. However, if the bend is just in the glans (penis head) being bent down when erect then the likelihood is that you are suffering from a developmental problem called frenulum breve. You then need to see a doctor to get your errant frenulum sorted out as frenulum breve does not cure itself and will interfere with proper and enjoyable sex when you are older.
Manipulating hormones comes with side effects - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I cant say enough for argan life Ultra Nourishing Argan Oil. It has helped my acne tremendously and it is such a great hair conditioner. My skin is still a little flaky but that's ok. I highly recommend this product :)
getting hormones would probably mess up your hormones resulting in even more acne.
estrogen I think
Serious answers please... if you don t know, don t answer please...I shaved my legs and that night it felt like I had a pimple on my leg. I didn t look, I just popped it. And when I squeezed it, it seemed like later I had a line of mini bumps coming from that "sore", straight line from it. They blend with my skin and itch if I touch them. It s been over a week and still there...
Two possibilities, ingrown hairs or shingles. You should see a doctor because if it's shingles, you can make others sick until it scabs over. They can also give you something for the itching. (cortisone cream and lidocaine cream) Shingles appears in a straight line of little bumps.
Sounds like Razor burn. Just make sure to moisturize them twice a day with cortisone cream. Its super normal.
Possible bed bugs get bed bug kit at bed bath and beyond
It keeps the body working better than if you done no exercise - I am type 2 diabetic and my diet is usually good but I do have bad days but i do a lot of eercise through my work and my blood tests are always very good.
Exercise helps the body to better utilise [utilize, if you are, in fact, one of my American cousins] insulin. In type 2 diabetes this helps to reduce insulin resistance, and in type 1 diabetes because the insulin is being better utilised [utilized] a reduced amount of insulin would be required to be injected as your body would be able to use up more of the glucose, which we get from the breakdown of carbohydrates during the digestive process, to create energy.
Walking 30 mins a day reduces blood glucose levels hopefully to the point of reversing type 2
To help regulate and keep your sugar more down and in control! Helps keep your arteries from being like a saw blade which cause irregular heart flow and irregular heart beat also. Sugar damages the arteries.
Reduces the effects experienced by diabetes.

Your penis size of 5.7 inches is perfect. The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches so your penis is a wonderful size. It is perfectly fine to masturbate a lot too.
Good size, given adult average is 5.16 inches and you are well above that. Masturbation is just solo sex, and normal thing to do. Average teen masturbates at least once daily.
it's fine for your age
Prove it
You don't want that- - if you stretch your sack it may hang lower but gravity gradually does that anyway-- so guys at 50 hang much lower than a guy your age. If you deliberately make it hang low at your age, could be knocking you knees by 50. Not a pretty sight. Nearly all guys in the teens and 20s will find their scrotum taunt most of the time, locked and loaded ready for ejaculation. Shows you have a good testosterone level.
There are some scrotum stretching techniques, but these are usually very only temporary. And they also require ongoing stretching for months and years. The bottom line is that some guys have low hangers, While others are just high and tight. Others may be somewhere between those.
In summer they hang and in winter they contract. Hence try to remain in hot weather so that your balls will hang always. Regards.
You shouldn't want your testicles to hang lower. Having testicles that are up and tight are the best.
Avoid cold water and cold weather.
Stop masturbating. Orgasm causes the cremaster muscles to contract, raising them.
the more they hang down, the more they slow you down during sex
stand in the hot sun
be happy they hang where they are
No
adhd is real, some people have much more difficulty focusing or not being active. it's not bad behavior, it just means the person needs different ways of being taught.
It's a real condition.
Today my mothers nurse practitioner called informing her that the doctor said she might want to cancel the last 3 chemotherapy sessions because of possible permanent nerve damage in her feet (neuropathy). The decision is being left to her which I think is unfair. She has already done 9 chemotherapy sessions, her tumor has shrunk and also she has triple negative breast cancer(stage 1). We have no idea if the cancer is gone (they have yet to inform us about that which is very odd since the whole cancellation of 3 chemotherapy sessions is being told to us).
Triple negative breast cancer is a fast growing cancer and the usual medication like Herceptin wont work but can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and new treatments such as PARP inhibitors, it is better to contue with the chemo and get the cancer cured and be alive than worry about the nerve damage to her feet, Good Luck
She has to weigh the risk of the cancer not being gone with the risk of permanent problems with her feet. That's not a choice anyone but she can make. The doctor can't decide. What is worse to her?
She needs to see her doctor and discuss face to face the risks and benefits of her options. This would include asking about the possibility of alternate treatments.
She should talk face to face with the Doctor before she decides.
I just recently started vaping to quit smoking and dipping and being completely honest I feel great! My lungs feel cleaner, I don t feel so drowsy, and I am getting a lot more work done! If its making me feel this much better then what s wrong with it? I understand it has chemicals but there is no way it s terrible or worse than Cigerettes or Dipping, right?
It's less acutely toxic than smoking but first nicotine is highly addictive and bad for you. Second we don't know the effect of long term use. We will find out in time. Your assumption that it's safe because it feels ok it ludicrous. Tell that to asbestos worker who feel fine for decades till their mesothelioma kills them
Vaping delivers the drug nicotine. Nicotine is extremely addictive and very bad for the heart. Actually bad. Tremendously worse than any warning on the label.
It's less harmful than smoking. Multiple studies have shown that, as well as every vaping ex-smoker you will ever meet. Not harmless, but nowhere near as harmful as inhaling tobacco smoke.
Big Tobacco fears competition and loss of cigarettes sales so they poured millions into their lobbyist fund to get the puppets on the FDA to block e-cigs. It has NOTHING to do with health, it has to do with tobacco lobbyists wanting you to smoke (and become addicted) to their products. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/396466/big-tobaccos-war-vaping-gregory-conley
The problem is CHILDREN getting a hold of it has being natural, or harmless. THAT is the problem.
a cure is something that will get rid of the illness completely but a treatment is something that will help you to feel better and maybe help you but it isn't guaranteed to cure you. I hope this helped!
a cure is what actually cures ur self but a treatment could just help u to mke u feel better. for example there is now way to cure cancer.but they can give treatment like painkillers wich wont cure but will help
cure is when your illness is gone. treatment is to help your illness but never a guarantee it will work. so with cancer, there is no cure. but there are treatments to help it from spreading/or buy you some more time and maybe even work depending what stage of cancer
The only true cure for anything is death. Medically, we treat illnesses. We have no cures, no guarantees.
treatment isn't to get rid of something like a disease fully it's to help treat it so it progresses very slowly and a cure is something to get rid of a disease for good and it's used to help fully treat things like that i hoped this helped
No
I am 29 yrs old female.n I have huge breast size with very small ribcage.my breasts size is 30e..now problem with me is dat rest of my body is slim n only breast alone are big..due to which dey look saggy...I am having problem choosing bras also....I just wanted to is Der any solution dat I can make my breasts appear smaller?
First, using D instead of th is lazy and makes you look like an idiot. As does your lousy grammar. Use a sports bra. You can get them 3 for $10 at Walmart. They are comfortable, don't have wires to stab you, and minimize. Just an FYI, wearing bras can lead to sagging. You shouldn't be sagging at 29. So try to go braless when you can.
Using correct spelling, punctuation and grammar helps. I don't believe you are 29, sorry. You appear to be a 14 year old boy.
You're mangling the English language.

You should be concerned with Anything that shoots with great force. Otherwise not worse than lube. < M
A little bit. Now rinse it with water. Otherwise you will make a lot of bubbles when you far.t

so im pretty overweight. 5'8 and 200 pounds almost all fat.i do not really exercise at all and i want to start losing weight. i read online that a 2 hour hike can burn upwards of 1000 calories so i was wondering if i did a 2 hour hike ever day or every other day[depending on if my legs need to heal] for a month how much weight i would actually lose with no change to my diet.
If you've never been physically active and are way out of shape, then maybe dial back your expectations and start with a half hour at a time. It won't really do you any good if you do a whole bunch one day and then can't move for a week afterward. Work your way up to longer hikes.
Not much weight loss and probably some stress on your legs. You need to change your diet to a healthy, crap/junk free diet or you will never get fit. Being fit and trim requires a healty diet and moderate exercise, lifetime committment.
Impossible to guess, since we don't know what your diet actually is.
You should listen to the advice of your urologist. Your prostate is not enlarged necessarily. You may have a prostate infection as this could account for all of your symptoms, decreased flow of urine, burning with urination, and erectile dysfunction. Specific antibiotics may be necessary. Call the office and find out what they plan to do.
If you need a little spark added to the bedroom this is a great starting place. These Prolargent 5x5 Extreme enhancement pills are great. They increase the blood flow so it adds an improvement in energy, increased drive and stamina. This is also good as a calming affect for anxiety as well as it can lower blood pressure.
If you haven't been masturbating regularly, then you should. Prostate health depends upon regular ejaculations. A minimum of twice weekly, and probably more often if you're having problems now.
consult you doctor, I am not a prostate pecialist
The doctor should be giving you medication for it.
Do it with a boy's hand.

It's not selfish, I think it could be two things: - Either you have somehow internalized that disease is a part of life and there is nothing much you can do about it. - Or it is possible that you have not processed it yet. You might be in denial. You just don't know it. Its okay not to feel sad, if that is how it is, a feeling cannot be forced upon. Sometimes emotions take too much time to feel. All you have to do is keep your faith, and hope high. You seem like a very strong person, you'll get through this! :) Good luck!
No; it's not selfish. To be honest, I think it is good! Instead of moping around in a cesspool of self-pity, you've found a new normal, and carried on with life. Yeah, it will be hard. You'll have tough treatments to come. But there isn't any point in wasting your life by focussing on the bad stuff. You are just making more of your life by continuing to have one; by continuing to live your life, rather than shut down. Logically, your reaction makes way more sense than most people's!
I had a surgeon who couldn't believe I was so calm about breast cancer. This is the most organised cancer series of treatment around, so I had no reason to panic.
No. I was the same way. It's more of a "Hey, I can do this", feeling. It's a fighting feeling...a "I know I can beat this" feeling, I was not sad nor upset either.
Maybe you're in shock? I'm sorry you've been diagnosed with cancer.
Ovarian cancer is often deadly. I have my doubts on your adulthood...
Masturbation sends more oxygen to the brain because of the excitement and increased blood flow, your brain gets more oxygen. This allows you to see more clearly, which choice you had been thinking before the masturbating session.
Simple-- your sex urge is a primal urge that can overtake all other urges and cloud your thinking until you take care of that urge- so simply masturbating and having a good climax and ejaculation will clear your mind and help you feel better and think clearer.
You're releasing stress.
Relaxes you.
U r wrong to me , it makes me gloomy
That does not seem like symptoms at all. It sound like you are just a big fan. OCD is about cleaning for long hours or having negative thoughts
No those aren't. OCD is intrusive thoughts not obsessions with bands.
If the thoughts are intrusive and otherwise not wanted, then possibly, but I highly doubt it. I go through band, and even people, phases all the time, just like yours.
im 15 and a im virgin my clit and my labia minora is big and its black and hangs out and are wrinkly im tan skin halfblack half white and everyone hates vaginas like that everone are disguted this meme ruined my day http://www.funnyjunk.com/channel/funny/Epic+meal+time/DgrzGQt/ this roast beef looks more beautiful then my pus s y .-.
The "roast beef" memes are made by immature boys who don't know what a vulva is supposed to look like. In most women, the labia is big. Its not uncommon for one side to be bigger than the other. When you see the vulvas of porn stars, you are generally looking at a vulva that has been surgically altered. Any REAL guy doesn't care what your vulva looks like. He is smart enough to know that they come in all shapes and sizes.. And regardless of what it looks liiek, if you are showing it to him, he's getting laid anyways.
No boy or man for that matter is going to give a hoot about what your labia looks like. You are too young to understand this, but one day you will learn the truth.
well i am a 50 year old man and we couldn't care what it looks like as long as were getting some
Guys usually only care what your pussy feels like
If you are sure you are going to be ovulating on the 20th, then your fertile time is actually going to be that day plus 2 days before & 2 days after the 20th - for a total of 5 days. So, your fertile period will be the 18th through the 22nd. That is because of the length of time that sperm cells can remain alive inside your body. A condom, when used properly and doesn't break, is about 90% effective at preventing pregnancy. To be absolutely safe, you should hold off having sex until after the 23rd.
Condoms are a reasonably safe method of contraception but not perfect. To be safer put in some spermicide before having sex in addition to that on the condom. Better still would be to start using the pill or other female birth control as soon as possible although there is not enough time before 21st.
If the condom breaks you could be a mommy.
the entire point of using protection is to have safe sex on any day you want to.
You'll find out around June 18th if it was or not.
If you don't know, maybe rethink having sex at all.
hi im a girl 16 this was my 1st massage i had full body massage, well i wear some underwear he told me if he can take them off when he wanted massage my lower back/ butt and said its better without so he took them off i thought that was bit weird well he focused alot on my butt and never put a towel over me, i also had a bra on when i was on my back but didnt remove
Where did you get the massage? Was it a professional, licensed company, with fully qualified massage therapists? In my experience, you normally keep pants on and remove bra. If he was touching your lower back/top of your butt, that's ok. If he was actually massaging your butt cheeks, that is inappropriate and you should file an official complaint. In any case, you should have had a towel over you.
Sounds inappropriate given your age. No reputable massage "therapist" should have taken the panties off a minor.
Rather depends on the Terms you agreed. If you are over 16 and agreed with service offered, then I cannot see how you can complain. You pays your money = it is up to you to make clear whether full body massage is FULL or not. Don't go to these places if you are naiive. < M
I take off my bra and underwear with my massage therapist. She does leave a towel/sheet over me. Was there any touching that was groping? Or was it really just massage. It may have just been unusual to you?
to me that sounds like sexual assault he should have at least put a towel over you so u keep some dignity its up to u but if he works for a company id put in a complaint or talk to your parents on how best to deal with it as what he did was innapropriate
No. Don't do it unless you want to get herpes! If he leaves you, then it just shows what he really wants. Sex.
Dry fûck yourself
No, you can still get the virus even without symptoms.
Leave. He does not always see any sores on the under side of his penis or testicles.
No way.
You shiver when you're cold, and when you shiver you can burn 100 calories in 15 minutes in some cases, whereas sweating and being hot does NOT burn calories, sweat is just your body trying to cool itself down. So in theory you'd lose more weight being cold but I wouldn't suggest it as a method of weight loss.
when its cold well bottom line is anytime you put your body In a different climate then its used to weather its hot or cold its burning calories to adjust to that but its not a significant or extensive amount so ya
cold
You most likely have trichotillomania. Try to focusing on something else or getting your mind off of the thing that is causing you stress. If this doesn't work try putting a rubber band on your wrist and whenever you feel anxious or stressed pull and release the rubber band.
Hi! You might have trichotillomania.. A common mental disorder that causes you to pluck hairs from different parts of your body. I recommend habit reversal training, and trying to find other things to do with your hands. Try adding bangles on your hands so you can keep track of what your hands are doing. Loo up support videos on youtube and learn about your disorder.
Wear an elastic band on your wrist and flick that instead.

Chunks of white from your vagina is a sign of thrush. See your GP or pharmacist for treatment. I don't understand your question.
That's where cottage cheese comes from.
it's perfectly normal and over time it will change
yes, quite normal and don't watch porn, it's a poor way to introduce females to yourself....
Troll.
All that was missing was the two slices of bread.
40 lbs in 2 months = 5 lbs/week. This is VERY hard and probably not do-able. You might be able to lose 5 lbs the first week, but after that, it will drop off considerably. Why don't you aim for 2 or 3 lb/week. 2 lbs is realistic. 3 lbs is difficult, but almost do-able. EDIT: There are hundreds of diet books, online and hard copy. By and large, stay away from foods that are white. Eat plenty of veggies and a little protein, mostly fish and chicken. EXERCISE. And don't weigh yourself every day. Not more than once a week.
STOP eating sugar....... That's really what you must do. Sugar is in all the junk food - that's bread, pasta, cereal, fruit juices, rice, potatoes - stuff like that. You need green vegetables and beans and some fruit. If you're 40 lbs overweight, then you've been eating junk food for a lot of years. So FIND OUT about it - read this book - it defines junk food and tells you what to avoid. If you don't do this, you're just wasting your time trying to lose weight.
Excersie in hot weather but stay hydrated and eat fruit and beef jerky
well that's physically impossible and you need to allow yourself more time
cut off your leg you dont need it right
Fruits and veg are ok. The reason you can eat almost unlimited is because you would get full before you start to lay on much fat. You don't need that much fruit...A few servings a day is fine. But make sure to really eat the veggies.
No of course not! Yes fruit and veggies are excellent for you.
be careful u dont have to much sugar. Im a personal trainor xxx
just don't eat too much red meat
Whoa. That's a small cack!
5 inches and your 13? Woah!! And don't touch or think or look at any girls you may think are attractive, just scootch under the desk a bit more so no one sees, think of something like a coloured wall so there is no way to get more aroused by that x

The evidence I have looked at seems to show that smoking weed helps to lift depression for a short time, however, in the long term, seems to make it much worse. I am concerned that you ask this in R&S when it is a health / psychology problem.
no. weed is illegal for a reason: IT DAMAGES YOUR BRAIN!..--Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Medicinal marijuana has been shown to help depression, anxiety, and other disorder and diseases like cancer fibromyalgia etc... Educate yourself before you make incorrect accusations. It is now medically used in 23 states and legal is 4. Many more states have iron the ballet for 2016 for legalization... It is not addictive, nor does it lead to other drugs... Educate yourselves...
no smoking weed leads to doing harder drugs and also is called sorcery it alters the mind. the only way you can smoke weed legally is if it is prescribed for you because you have an illeness that needs it to fell better. thanks for the question friend. God bless.
Sometimes. Not always. Some people prefer to be sober or drink alcohol because if you realize it marijuana makes you think deeply about yourself and your life. Some people who are depressed doesn't want to think about their life in a deep way because they are cowards.
No, it doesn't help, just gets you high for a few hours, dude. To get help for your depression, you need a professional counselor, therapist.
No, but it causes short term memory loss. So maybe you'll forget that you're depressed?
It may temporarily mask depression, just as it masks virtually every other brain function.
Some sources say yes. Others say no.
omg I have them too but I'm 13. can you email me I have questions I've never met a girl that had the same problem! bkatabury@yahoo.com
Perfectly normal and they probably won't fade. Just for future reference if you're going to compare yourself to porn stars remember they have makeup on.
They may go away or fade once your body size catches up to breast development which appears happened pretty fast.
i have them too and im 23. i think its normal as i see it in other people's breast too.. p.s. im a nurse
Wow, how can you live in this country and believe that???? And there are cures for certain cancers alredy in lower stages. I personally know 3 people that have had cancer and it's been cured.
Not our government here in UK because we dont pay for medical or hospital treatment and it costs the NHS billions each year and if there was a cancer cure they would not hide it as it would save the government a fortune.
Which Government? To hide something like that you would have to have EVERY government in the world working together. Can you really see that happening????
Your mother's whack
Marijuana is probably the closest thing, and guess what, it's illegal.
I know you should not do any hard workouts while you are sick, but I walk about 2 miles everyday and the past 2 days I haven't bc I've been really sick. Today, I feel a little better but still have a high temp and a sore throat but really want to go for my walk. Will it delay my recovering to feeling better if I did go for my walk? Even if I just walked slowly?
First, it depends on how the weather is. If you have the flu, I wouldn't recommend going outside just yet. There's a possibility that you could even pass it on to someone else. It makes me really happy to hear that you enjoy being outside, but maybe hold off a little while until you feel a lot better.
Exercise is not recommended while you are still running a fever. You body is using its resources to fight the illness and you'd just be demanding even more of it. If you long to be outdoors for a bit, grab a lawn chair and enjoy some sunshine.
I think you could walk for a short distance slowly, but I would not advise 2 miles yet.
Talk to a doctor. When something similar happened to me the doctor diagnosed that I had a form of acid reflux. Basically over time lining in my stomach had wore away a bit. Prilosec and a slight diet change fixed me. Stay safe.
The caffeine can dilate the muscle that keeps your esophagus closed when you go to bed. This allows leakage of stomach acid that causes a chemical burn in the esophagus.
Could be that there is a tender spot on your esophagus where the lining has deteriorated enough to cause discomfort.
Aye I just turned 17 and I have a problem with my d. It's small as **** and I think I'll have problems during sexual intercourse. Length is 4 1/2 erect and 4 inch girth. Is it small? How do I make it bigger? Do d exercises actually work? Help, I don't want to suffer later in life and my girlfriend would problem want some of this shrimp later. Thanks. P.S. this is not a troll. Need some answers people.
Mine was small like that at 17 and never got bigger. I'm 28 now.
You're still growing. No need to worry. You're totally fine. Might end up with 5 or 6 inches someday. Relax.
Yes, that is definitely on the small side, and there isn't anything that will permanently make it bigger.
Yes small , cannot make it big any way. Be patient u have
Don't sit and think = go try it. Yes, you will need to research sex positions that give closer contact. < M
It will not grow by itself. Exercises will do. My b/f did it the same way. Depends how serious you are... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
Try to move your eyes around without moving your head. Take breaks from looking at the screen. Try adjusting the brightness and contrast. Get a larger screen. I notice the difference between when I'm on my laptop 15" and my home 50" screen. It seems that when I'm at home it's a lot easier to read for several hours at s time.
They actually sell glasses that can help with that! Also, be sure to always have a light on while you're using the computer; its less strain on your eyes. And try and take little 5 minute breaks in between every 30 minutes to an hour.
Try going to an eye doctor. You may need glasses.
Lower the resolution and the brightness.
i'm not pregnant because I'm a virgin. my period is about 12 days late and I don't have any physical symptoms like sore boobs or anything as a sign that it's at least coming soon. I have had PMS though for at least the past 4 days, especially depression. This usually stops right when my period comes. Is there any way to make it speed up?
You could talk to your dr. about putting you on birth control pills to regulate your periods. The estrogen in them might keep your body more regular.
It could be an immaculate conception.
every time I masturbate she walks in so I can't finish it off but if I don't once a day I get crabby I am surprised that either she hasn't find out cause I always have a blanket over or she just hasn't said anything about it I stopped because she might walk in again it was the 5th time lol should I say anything? or no?
Just lock the door. You have the right of privacy.
thats why doors have locks
Yes, your penis is on the smaller side being 4 3/4 to 5 inches. The average penis is 5 to 6 inches, so your penis is just slightly smaller than average at 4 3/4 inches and perfectly average at 5 inches.
That is considered small for a male age 16 or older.
Yes I'm 28 and mine is almost that size. Women consider mine small.
It's average and considered small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
It is below average depending on your race. Average (worldwide) is about 5.2 - 5.5 inches erect, flaccid about 3.6 - 3.8 inches. From a female perspective, I wouldn't worry about it. Don't judge our lady parts, and we won't judge yours. They are all different looking, and come in different sizes.
Below average of 5.16 but just barely. Probably in the normal size range.
Seriously in my 53 years I've never heard of anyone measuring themselves???
It's on the smaller side of average
Yes, small bordering on ridiculously small.
It's in the normal range.
It's highly unlikely that only ONE bad sunburn will cause cancer, you need years in the sun and multiple times getting burnt to develop a melenoma not just ONE time.
Most of us have been sunburnt several times and not got cancer, I am almost 60years old and also been sunburnt several times and not had skin cancer, my parnter is never in the sun and works constant nightshift had skin cancer a few years ago and doctor told him it was nothig to do with the sun and just bad luck.
No, not at all. My goodness I have been burned for nearly 35 years every time I go out in the sun....35 years of summer.....figure that out...No you will not get melanoma from one day in the sun.
It builds up. Do your best to remember.
Different people find different forms of exercise to be exciting and fun to do. Yours might just be the case that doing weights isn't the type that excites you. Some people can even think of the whole idea of exercising as boring, but it depends on how you do it. Maybe you could put on some music or do it with a friend to help excite you more. Some friendly competition never hurts. You never know, this could turn into your new favorite thing to do.
I love it. Everyday I get to see what this stupid meat sack can do. It's just a fun distraction like working on a car but with far more pork chops. I find most people who have the complaint you do are doing it because they want to look cool by being fit or think they kinda should do it for some ethereal "better health." I don't like to do my taxes. That's boring to me.
Lifting weights is boring to most people Most of us find that having to think about the process uses up just enough of our brain so that we can't think that well about other things, like daydreaming. or distract ourselves with tv. running and bike riding don' use as much of our brain so we can daydream or distract ourselves with TV or Radio.
I usually do not feel this because the whole point is to push yourself. If you're really pushing yourself in that workout then you probably shouldn't be getting bored
Well it's not supposed to be fun lol. Listen to music you love while this, it'll be more enjoyable
It's boring.
Your therapist is there to help you, so she will do whatever she thinks is in your best interests. Jumping off a garage is a bad idea, partly because you might not kill yourself and my end up being crippled, paralysed for the rest of your life, unable to move. Many attempted suicides end up with the person still alive but stuck in a long lifetime of pain. If I were you I would keep working with the therapist. There are still solutions to become happy, and when you find the right one you will be so glad you did.
I believe therapists are required to inform someone if they believe a patient is a threat to himself or someone else (like if a patient seemed to be seriously planning on hurting someone). But she can't call the police about something you haven't done yet. They can't follow you around to keep you off roofs and ledges. She probably would have you hospitalized for your own safety.
Jumping from height gives you some chance of surviving with painful injuries. A better method of suicide is a fast where you consume only pure water. This is graceful death, not painful, and gives you time to put things in order before leaving.
No, therapists are very trustworthy people. They keep everything that you tell them to themselves. It would be absolutely terrible to use your problems against you.
yes she will and you'll end up getting locked up again
No, he will not become infertile, but it is possible that his chance of conceiving may decrease.
Head tumours can cause infertility by damage to the pituitary gland.
It depends where the tumour is, if it is in his testicles, then yes it could cause infertility but anywhere else and you should be fine
Unless he has a tumor in the prostate or testicles then no, it will not make him infertile.
No it wont but I am sure being fertile or not is not something he will care about if dying because of a brain tumour?
It would depend on several factors. His doctors will have told him if this is a possibility/probability. He will tell you if it is any of your business.
This sounds highly unlikely.
Depends... it might do, or it might make no difference...
Not really so long as you're getting all the nutrients (e.g. protein, vitamin D, etc.), but if there is no particular reason for being a veggie, you should have some meat or fish.
You need vitamin B12 to live, and as far as I know, there's no vegetable or fruit that contains vitamin B12. So you may need to supplement with B12 if all you're eating are veggies and fruits. Possibly iron and vitamin D as well.
hey, what you eat is what you are. There are pleanty of ways to stay healthy by avoiding meat. Just make sure you maintain a balanced diet.
As you are now old enough to read and write, you are old enough to thrive as a vegetarian. You will be fine.
Kind of because meat is healthy.
Well fish has omega so it makes you smarter
Yes. Where is your protein?
You're not going to get an std or HIV from some one that doesn't have any. Stds are not likely to be passed out side of having sex. Things that can be passed by kissing are cold sores and mono, but only if she has them. You can't create an std from thin air, some one has to have it in order to pass it onto you.
If you have sex then there's a chance all the time you could some but if you just kissed her then no
If she doesn't: no. And definitely not just by kissing her.
NO you will NOT.
You body produces semen 24 hours a day. It has to go out either by way of intercourse , jacking off or wet dreams. If you are practicing masturbation ie jacking off, you may not get wet dreams. Any jacking off is better than wet dreams as you can enjoy the act , clothes or bed too will not get spoiled . Regards.
Wet dreams are caused by stimulation during sleep that causes ejaculation.
Having a sexual dream in which you are sexually excited in your dream will cause a wet dream it's sticky clear liquid it's not sperm all the time.
Do you feel the pulse when your masturbating and youre ready to shoot, same thing happen when your having wet dream theres an involuntary contraction in your muscles same when youre in your "point of no return"...
In some ways, the penis is stimulated simply by rubbing against clothing or the bed.
Being born...
the excess cu mm builds up and if you dont wa nk your body expels it for you
too little and rare sex activity causes them
No. You should wait 2 weeks.

Not everyone who smokes and drinks gets cancer. If people did the homework they would learn that your own bodies immune system if your first line of defense against cancer. Right now, we all have cancer cells in our bodies, it's your immune system that keeps then in check.
The fact is, life in general results in death. No matter how you live, how you work out, how you do anything in hopes of prolonging your life; you're still going to die. Each of us is allotted so many days in the sunlight, and then it ends.
Sadly their "Enjoyment" of such cancer causing things overpowers there mind with a "That will never happen to me" attitude. Thus they do not care if it results in death, which to them "is far long down the road"
What about the Obese Americans, are they not worried about their health?
The average penis size for your age is 3 to 4 inches. So your penis at 5 1/2 inches is bigger than average and definitely a very good size.
Your fine. And your still growing. Your body will grow until your 21 or so. That means your penis will get bigger as well. The average size is 4-6 inches. So I'm gonna guess you will be above average.
Well 13 average is 3.6 inches erect. So you are pretty big. < M
Hahaha. Fantasies.
Yes that is normal an okay
Slightly above adult average already.
I had unprotected sex with this boy a few days ago and since then I have been having problems at first it was pain because he was very big and it hurt after wards because he was that big, the pain has gone now but now I have this white stuff around my clit and it looks like it's in the inside as well, I don't know why this is like this because usually I never get this, I'm just worried incase it's an STI or something. Any thoughts?
Yeast infection.
Umm this could just be thrush, either way I suggest going to the doctors just in case
You'll probably get a mosquito bite on your lip too, and the mosquito bite will keep coming back every once and a while.
Nothing will happen
the mosquito bite gets better :P
Nothing.
malaria ensues
Maybe some sex later.
You get the tuberculosis.
Instant death.
Wow Jeremy... Your penis has grown a lot in the last 2 weeks. You claimed before that it was only 4 inches, now it's over 5 inches. Not sure how that's possible unless you're a troll. LMAO
No, your penis at 5 inches plus is not small for your age. It is perfectly fine.
That sounds pretty normal to me
The average guy is 5.5inches when erect.
Hi so you are a big boy so keep it to yourself other wise they will all want on that long.
Right at adult average.
If you have to ask, yes
Yes, it is okay for a 14 year old guy to shave his armpits and pubic hair if he wants. Natural is usually best, so a trim is okay also if you want.
It's totally fine to do whatever makes you comfortable in that sense. If you feel best shaving your pubic area and your arm pits, then keep doing so.
14 is a child not a man but shave whatever you want.
A 14-year-old man. How cute. It's your body. Do whatever you want with it.
Yes
14 yr old boys might shave their hair off, men don't generally do that.
Yes it's ok to shave.
Sure, but whenever you shave, the hair will come back thicker and thicker, and you will probably have to shave for the rest of your life.
Yeh thats fine
According to the CDC: the average height of a 14 year old is 5'4.65in (164.2cm) and for 14.5 years old it's 5'6 (167.5cm) so unless you're like 14 and 11 months, you're above average height for a 14 year old
Most guys don't stop growing in height until 15-18 so you likely have a year or even several left to grow.
Your height of 5'7" is actually taller than the average of 5'4" for your age.
you were taller than I was at 14, and I am 6'2" now, so there is hope yet!
You will grow 4.5 inches in 27 months.
if your parents are taller then you then you will grow more till 20 years of age
Crystal ball. Ask... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
That's normal for a White man.
Nope. Wishing you were more like another race does not make you a racists. Now hating on another race because of their natural "gifts"/predispositions makes you a racist.
I am black and my penis is very small
not ALL black guys have large penii
No. It makes you Delirious.
yes it does make you a bad person
lol
I stubbed my toe not long again and felt the nail move but today half of the nail fell off, the nail that's left is shaped at angle due to the way the other half fell off. It was completely painless. But I can't reshape the remaining nail because it's too short. What should I do? I've wrapped a baby wipe around by toe to keep the exposed skin clean
The nail will grow back. I would keep it clean and covered if its uncomfortable. Be sure to timely trim it as it grows out so it doesnt break again.
Let it grow up till you can clip it off until it's it normal size
put triple antibiotic ointment and a band aid on the toe and try soaking it in cool water and epson salts
there's really not much to be done, just wait for the nail to grow back. It may take months.
keep it clean and give the nail time to grow
Keep it clean, it will grow back
Can be from running
It depends. Want some more information. How, when. Did it happen on its own. Please throw some more light.
I'm a 16 year old girl I recently put on weight as I used to exercise everyday for 2-3 hours and although I still exercise not as much. I used to be 8 stone (112). These are my measurements now 5 foot 10 stone (140 pounds) Bust: 39 inches Waist 29 inches Bum/hips 39 inches Thigh: 24 inches Do you think I sound unhealthy should I lose weight. People say I look healthy and are shocked when I tell them how much I weigh.
Totally not. That sounds absolutely perfect to me. But it's never a bad idea to eat healthy and stuff. Don't think that it's ok to just like on weight but don't feel like u need to lose any. Just love yourslef without getting out of control
It actually sounds like you have great proportions. That's a gift, since many people strive for that. I'm lucky to be tall with the ability to put on mass easily. As good as your appearance likely is, you will feel better and maintain it long-term by getting fit again. To me, weight is hardly a factor in attractiveness. It's personality, health and fitness. Get back in the gym! Lol
Your weight is normal. Don't lose weight.
Very good. I will subscribe for this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product monthly.
One normal wash with soap ad warm water was enough to remove and kill all the sperm that might have been on your hands. No need for long washes nor multiple ones.
Sperm cells die after about 2 minutes exposed to air, washing your hands once is enough. Don't be concerned.
Enough for what? Any semen would have been washed off with plain water.
that's more than enough
Depression is common but easy to treat. Ask a dr. if you could have low dose Zoloft. After your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel so much better.--- Then find big happy churches, attend age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Its also the best way to meet good people. And talk with the pastor/minister; where else can you get counseling for free? -- Remember God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
How old you? Are you still in school? If so, go talk to the counselor or nurse at school. They can help you figure out the next steps towards feeling better about yourself and about your life.
its kind of normal, think positive. You love your mom and it just worried you. The fact is that parents cannot be angry for a long time.They love their children. Have a clear discussion with her and I am sure she will understand
I appreciate your best efforts to get relief. I believe your so called question. As desired by you, I will surely send that "someone" to you today. Please seek full clarifications from that someone for all your genuine doubts pertaining to mental health.
There are loads of reasons for missing a period, including but not limited to: Pregnancy, Stress, Eating problems, Certain birth controls such as the hormonal IUS, Rapid weight loss or gain, Being too lean (low body fat), Illness, Certain medications, Extreme exercise, Breastfeeding, Hormonal issues, Puberty, Peri-menopause, etc.
Infections, pregnancy, certain birth control can cause missed periods, stress, not enough food, extreme exercise, weight gain or loss, not enough fat (as in too lean), hormonal imbalance, thyroid issues, certain medications, perimenopause, breastfeeding, and sometimes a simple cold/flu can stress your body out enough to mess with periods
too many to mention, pregnancy, stress, anorexia, big increase in physical exercise are some major ones
Hormones, Too little calories, too much exercise, fast weight loss, fast weight gain...Stress, etc.
I've been *kind of* actively trying to lose weight in for the past month. By kind of, I mean I'm only eating until I'm satisfied rather than what I did before which was eat like pizzas and doughnuts every day and eat because I'm bored and then pretty much just graze all day. And now I try to work out a little more...I do 15-20 squats and 50-100 sit ups each day depending on how tired I am. I'm a 24 year old guy, btw and I'm only 5'5" and started at 183 and as of yesterday I'm at 165.
Not really. You'd need to take it seriously. I'd say 10 pounds per month is a more realistic goal, but you should at least aim for 18 pounds.
So what does your rant have to do with your question? Normal weight loss is one pound per week. Fat is made of carbon and hydrogen. The only way it comes out is to turn into CO2 and water, and then it comes out through the lungs. You just can't breathe much faster than a pound a week.
Squats and situps don't help much. Fastest way possible to lose weight? Elliptical runners. These work out almost all your muscles at once and just burn fat extremely fast.
My friend sometimes doesn't eat as much as she should. Some days, she eats a normal sized lunch, but that's all she eats for the day. She never eats breakfast, and skips lunch a lot. She barely ever eats more than 1000 calories a day, and yesterday she only ate 300. Then she said she felt dizzy and walked around really slowly all day. There's definitely something wrong and I don't know what to do.
She needs 1800 - 2200 calories a day. Any less is causing serious damage to her body. Tell your teachers immediately and get her help. If she hates you for it, so be it you'll be saving her life.
1500-1800. If she's not eating properly use those nutritional drinks like Boost.
1500
I m almost 15 & still no period. I m turning 15 soon and I m getting signs, so I think I ll get it soon. My mom never really gave me THE TALK, about bras or periods or that stuff. When she briefly did, she said something like "You ll use tampons, they re WAAAAY easier." However, I feel more comfortable STARTING with pads and then using tampons later. However, my moms hard to talk to about this stuff. I want to somehow buy a pack of pads to prepare for my period, but HOW?
It shouldn't have to be too awkward. Your mother is a woman and she'll understand that you may want to try different methods of containing your flow. You don't even have to say anything, just go to the store with her and put a pack of pads into the cart. If she asks, just tell her you want to be prepared and want to try out pads first. Also, while pads are a lot less daunting than tampons, tampons are great when you're ready for them!
Join the club lol I haven't started yet either. Its awkward when my friends are talking about their periods and I'm just standing there with no boobs and just awkwardly not being able to join in the convo. But apparently , u may feel weak for losing blood so drink lots of water and eat lots of fruit n veg and carbohydrates. Soz I couldn't give proper advice yh
When there r few days left before the start of your periods and during periods take multi-vitamin capsules or vitamin E capsules because in that way u will not feel the pain in your stomuch.u can also take multi-vitamin for 1 month and then give a break of 1 month then take multi-vitamin for the next 1 month and so on.this is so because too much multi-vitamin consumption can harm your liver and kidneys.search the internet to know the names of vegetables n fruits that r rich in vitamin E.
inform your mom that you want some pads for your first period because you feel intimidated with tampons. if she still says no then go out and buy some. or you could talk to your other parent about it assuming you have one. also drugs, midol and tylenol.
Just say you're uncomfortable with the idea of tampons and you would like to try pads
You go to the store and you buy them. It's simple as that. Best wishes.
hilarious. yes, stop eating dinner too. You will be the thinnest dead person ever....hottt. Girl, just go running (a SHORT run even!) then you can eat lots of HEALTHY food and actually look good. Do you know how grey and sallow the skin is of an undernourished person? You need a nice, healthy glow - and you get that from ACTION and FOOD.
Yes, stop eating dinner. Definitely will lose weight.
skipping meals will NOT help you lose weight - you body metabolism will slow down and you won't lose any weight
you're clearly aiming for death lol losing weight does not mean you should skip your meals, it's about cutting your calorie intake..love yourself.
eat yogurt every morning and every night, but eat normal food during launch
No. Just eat smaller meals. DO NOT STOP EATING AT ALL!!!!!
YES! you should definitely tell a teacher but Krin could also be having some problems and decides to take it out on others... but like you said she could also be psycho. But if you don't want to be having to deal with Krin being mad at you, you should tell a teacher in secret.
Definitely talk to a counselor or principal. I was in the suicidal boat a while ago and they got me help. Plus you can keep it completely confidential if you want to
Lees even these people to their fantasies. Have normal friends.
I agree she does sound crazy geez. You should tell someone. That is really wrong of her to do.
Hypochondria. The only type of cancer this could possibly be from your description is melanoma and that is fairly unlikely. Get your Dr to have a look at your next check up. In the meantime, http://www.scarleteen.com/ is a great website, designed to teach teenagers basic sex education facts, like correctly being able to identify different parts of your anatomy. You know the difference between fingers, knuckles and palms of your hands. You should know the difference between vagina, clitoris, mons and labia.
It's highly unlikely that you have vaginal cancer especially cause your really young and the purple dot could be there from a lot of reasons. If it doesn't go away for about 3months and is causing you trouble like pain or if it is tender than you should probably tell your mum or you can go to the doctor by yourself seeing as you are 16.
I've had the same thing happen to me, I am 17 and also a virgin. It's completely harmless from what I've found, but if it's really concerning you, you should go see a gynecologist. It's just a little dot that will not cause you any harm, kinda like a freckle in a way. Hope I eased a bit of your worries :)
TOTALLY Hypochondria. Your mother can't see the inside of your vagina, only a gynecologist can. You are talking about your labia, ask your mom to make an appointment with a gynecologist if you want to...he can put your mind at ease in minutes.
Sigh......if you've convinced yourself then of course you're a hypochondriac. that's undeniable.
Not cancer and find another hobby..
Not sure why this is in the Diet and Fitness Section. I advise you don't eat any, it's 2AM. If you're desperate then grab a bowl of cereal and sit up for 10 more minutes and hit the bed. It's Friday, but it's not Fat Friday.
Ice cream
Have some light veggies with heart healthy fat such as avocado, olive oil, nuts etc. Also have some lean protein this combo will curb your craving without the guilt
Pizza is better the ice cream, because ice cream makes your stomach hurt.
neither!! make some soup or a yogurt with chocolate chips or fruit in it. The calories will not be worth it.
I'd choose all and yolo
Why not both?
No. What happens is the nerves aren't exciting the brain as much anymore. When you are young, and it is new, the nerves are brand new and so they are very sensitive. Feet are the same way. If you never go barefooted and all of the sudden start, you feel ever little thing you walk on outside. But if you are a hippie beach type, you can walk over fire and glass and have it not hurt. The brain gets used to it and so it turns the sensation down.
I guess you'd have to stop for a REALLY long time if u want it like before. Kinda like letting the skin heal.
Might do. Depends what UTI you got. Try using coconut oil. < M
of course
No, heating food in a microwave does not destroy the nutrients in them.
No. That's an old wives' tale from people who are afraid of microwave radiation. Microwaving food is the same as heating it on the stove, in the oven, or in the sun.
Minerals no. There would be some denaturing of protein, but that isn't important. Some vitamins can be damaged by the heating process.
It doesn't affect the minerals at all. Some vitamins ie vitamin C can be lost during the heating process.
no it won't
Absolutely, yes. You CAN masturbate while having chicken pox on your "penis skin."
I would not do it- you might spread pox to your penis and could cause scarring down there since it is much thinner, delicate skin. In fact should wash your hands before touching our gear to pee.
For me, you can wait until your chicken pox is gone.
If you're into pain; go ahead.
that would be choking the chicken
It means that you weren't wet enough when you had sex with your bf
Are you Borat?
sorry i cannot understand what you are asking from me
What do you normally do about your period?
He just wanted his *** inside of you you should appreciate the compliment
Without a condom? It sounds like you're both irresponsible having sex. You're going to either get pregnant or catch a sexually transmitted disease.
What?? Ask him...but okok, men like to *** inside because it feels really good, and when I say good it means realllly good! So, i don't know what u wanna do wit him but....pee from time to time drink lots of water.
Whatd he do wrong??? He said he pull out.. After he cumed
he thought what the heck, why not become a proud dad in 9 months time?
sounds too me like he just couldn't hold it and that's why you wear a condom
Some guys do this when they are caught up in the moment.
In winters, I always feel down. I hate winters so much, with passion. I don't ever want it to be winter. I hate grey skies and rain. It depresses me to the point where I no longer want to live anymore. I like sunny and living things. Summer is coming and I'm happy again after 7 months of depression. I can't take this anymore because I have to prepare myself again for next winter this summer. It's killing me.
U live in Siberia ? Drama Queens there know how to enjoy being alive in the winter. Ur problem is u choose to make winter a n issue. Libraries can help u get educated locally. Start there Want summer ALL year ? Learn Spanish and move to Nicaragua
I have the EXACT same issue...It's called Seasonal affective disorder..nothing is wrong with you,many people have this issue..It sucks,I know...It's cloudy and rainy here right now,and I've felt so depressed..Best bet is to see a dr..They make special lights and all to put in your house that can help this! You're no crazy,don't worry! I have the same thing so I totally know how you feel
The ones saying you have seasonal effective disorder are right . BUT THey arent telling you everything ... YOU can get a lamp ...easy to order on the net...and if you use this light as directed you will get better fast. THE THING IS you get depressed because your not getting enough of the sun ...thats all it is ..and this lamp is the same kind of light as the sun , not just any light will work so make sure you get it from a reputable company ...I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST!!...OH AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO SPEND A FORTUNE ON DOCTORS!
It sounds like you suffer from Seasonal Affected Disorder (SAD). You can get help from a medical professional.
I love winter. Blasphemy!
I have blue eyes and I am very, very happy with them. But I wish I could change them for brown eyes if it meant I could have 20/20 vision :( If you have 20/20 vision be VERY thankful. It is much worse than simply having brown eyes.
That does not give you a good reason to focus on it. Your eyes work, let them be! they're fine. And some people do like brown eyes, so dont assume they're all lying.
Every eye colour is beautiful
I don't agree. brown eyes can be really beautiful. like deer eyes. what about mariska hargitay or mila kunis
Keep wishing.
Use paint
Be grateful you have eyesight -_-

My two front teeth and ones next to it are sticking out and it looks like I got Beaver teeth but I was wondering if I could use my mouth guard from when I played a contract sport to straighten them, I boiled them and shaped the guard to slowly straighten my teeth and it feels like It is. Any advice (I'm trying this because I can't afford braces)
It won't work. You need either braces, or if you qualify Invisalign, save money and see an orthodontist to get your teeth straight.
Nope. Mouthguard wont straighten your teeth. You need to get braces to straighten your teeth. Braces straighten your teeth.
U can try
Totally normal for pregnancy..... it's mostly due to hormones. Seriously you should get a book about it so it not such a surprise.
The person to ask is your ob/gyn. It is foolish and dangerous to take medical advice from strangers who happen to be intelligent enough to sign in to Yahoo. Your hormones are raging. I get that. More than usual? Is this a problem? A PHYSICIAN would know.
It is most likely hormones. However, if you feel as if it is getting way out of control, talk to your doctor and see if anything is wrong.
Hoax
Haven't you ever wondered why, if it really worked it isn't more "mainstream". Don't you wonder why you don't hear people casually discussing it or why your doctor doesn't recommend it. If it were something that really truly worked, you wouldn't have to go looking for information on it, it would be everywhere. Take Viagra for example, it is a drug used to help treat erectile dysfunction, and you hear people talking about it all the time. You even see ads for it on TV or in magazines... your doctor may even talk to you about it if you have an E.D. issue. You hear about it all the time because (for most) it works.
Its bogus. There is no known benefit, and it can also cause damage.
i hate exercises
Good Luck! Been there myself and once you get over the first few days and in general population it will be OK. don't pretend to be something that you are not. Respect the other inmates and hear what they have to say but don't be a pushover. Listen to the guards and do what they say and they won't give you too much hassle. Don't be over friendly with them. It's like being the new guy in a school. Only it's mainly bad boys dressed in orange. You'll be bored for sure and teh food won't be great but it is jail after all
County lock up is like detention for the 13th grade if you didn't get raped in high school huffing choad in jail is unlikely. If you were sent to PRISON things would be different but jail is mostly boredom and bad smells.
Find the biggest dude and hit him if he gets back up or laugh play dead or run
it dont sound like much fun but at least its not a yr or something like that, hope the time goes faster for you, they might reduce the time too, you never know
I feel confused. Why would you burn a bible and a cross on purpose? That is considered a sin. At least you didn't burn God Himself (although it is impossible) for He is more important than any cross or bible book. And nobody wants to hear you tell all of the Internet that you burned a bible and cross. There was no point in saying that, and some people could get very upset. You could've just kept it to yourself and wrote it in your journal or something.
Wtf was the point of all this? Burning anything for no reason at all shows symptoms of being a phsycopath and/or pyromaniac. I would check in with your doctor. By the way, how would this hurt us. Literally it doesn't make me feel any emotion at all. Really. First of all, burning a cross would mean nothing compared to burning the holy bible. I would only feel bad if I were the one in your shoes. If you find any pleasure in this, go ahead and join ISIS.
I don't feel anything because it doesn't effect me. I'm personally agnostic, but I don't understand people who really care about these things. Someone burned a bible and a cross... So what. Unless it's your bible and cross who cares.
They still exist. Now you have to buy a new Bible is you change your mind. The cross is not a Christian symbol. If you are angry because the hypocrisy you are right. The Bible give us insight on how God wants to be worship. It expose hypocrites. John 4:24 24 God is a Spirit,+ and those worshipping him must worship with spirit and truth.” Hebrews 4:13 13 And there is not a creation that is hidden from his sight,+ but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of the one to whom we must give an account.
That's interesting. I lost a home to fire. The only thing left was our Bible. I have shared this testimony with many people and found that we are not alone. Bibles often survive fire and storms. God's word never returns void. You burn a Bible, someone shares another Bible.
Well- I sincerely hope it's NOT the way it is=these are not facts- but frenzying imagination... otherwise = inasmuch as that's the way it is... I'm afraid you urgently need the evaluation and professional help of a psychologist or psychiatrist thereof-in real life...with no further delay... just in case it's not all about trolling... it sounds to me a lousily horrid act... never mind what you agree with or not... it's the lousiest kind of violence on Earth - reminding the early days of Nazi Germany...
Burning a Bible and cross are two very horrible things to do.
by the law its either sacrilege or blasphemy. but its not unforgiveable. if you had done this in the days before the printing press it would have been a major crime., no doubt with jail and a large fine. some might have put you to death. if you showed no sign of repentance. personally, its only a misdemeanor because the bible is so widely available. imo. but you still have to face Jesus and 24 elders that will judge you. im more concerned about what other sin you are doing right now, that definitely need to be repented of...
I am totally indifferent to it. It is your right, freedom and liberty to express yourself, your feelings and your ignorance. The Bible... there are millions printed every single year here in America alone, and many times over worldwide. The cross is a manmade symbol, can be replaced easily enough, and there are so many, many, many more... so, what is it that you erroneously think YOU have accomplished? No one really cares that you're an ignoramus.
Your born with balls (testies) they just grow and then drop. I would say once you hit puberty you can get hard

There is no such thing as average bra size for a 14-year-old - regardless of your height and weight. You could still be flat as a board at fourteen or have a B cup. Now, what you can somewhat generalize about, is if you are a thin person, you wouldn't be likely to have big boobs. After all, breasts are mainly adipose (fatty) tissue.
Everyone grows different it depends on genes and DNA. However I'd say for that weight and height maybe an A cup or B cup
Every woman is different.
about 21, 3 times a day
Sometimes about 4 times a week
At least 7 (1-2 times a day)
3 times or 4 if I'm feeling it
I do it once a week. However it is very safe to do it every alternate days . ENJOY my friend. Regards.
Seven times or once a day.
Because I just started, at least once every 3 days, AT LEAST.
Every night! and multiple on the weekends.
I only masturbate once a week.
I can't keep track
Yes it is.
That's very small for a 13 year old. By age 13, you should have a penis that is 15-17 inches long. Anything smaller is classified as a micropenis. Most babies have a penis size of 5-7 inches at birth. So, to put it in layman's terms, you have a little baby dick.
Less than 5% are 7 inches or more-- and that is adult males, not 13 yr olds.
Assuming you're also over 7' tall, That would be proportionate with your height. Since you're only 13, it will probably continue to grow to the length of an elephant trunk. That would be about average.
Retarded troll... You expect us to believe that a 13 year old little boy has a penis larger than most grown men?
Hi it is adequate given you only need 2 inches to do the deed.
It's ok. It's not ok to ask. That show immaturity... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
I've never really been into taking supplements for working out, but I'm moving to Miami so I knew I had to step up my game. I've been focusing more on my diet and workout regime all summer so I can measure up in the beach scene but needed an extra boost. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea was at a good price point & I really like the ingredients all natural. I definitely noticed an improvement in my energy during my workouts. I also felt the niacin flush a bit but not when I took it with food as recommended .
for losing weight never skipping breakfast is important and having protein at breakfast. 4 or 5 small healthy meals throughout the day should work better, slowing your metabolism down by not eating is a big mistake.
It depends on your metabolism. But definitely enough to drop 50-60 pounds I don't recommend it, obviously, but those are the facts. Just remember to drink a lot of water. You can live on little food for months. You can live on little water for mere days
You may lose a little bit your body is going to keep holding on to the fat
Masturbation has no effect on how hard your penis gets.
Well, when you think there's a chance you're actually going to have real sex don't musturbate. Until then just have fun,
Exclude masturbation, massaging the penis honey

Okay yes I understand it's also a mental illness and I'm not asking because I want to try anything I'm just confused as of how people say "if you eat under 800 calories (or whatever amount) your body will go into starvation mode and you'll gain it all back quickly" or stuff like that yet people who develop anorexia dont eat as much either but still stay skinny and et skinnier without gaining it back so fast??
Starvation mode is a complete myth, if it existed then no one would be dangerously underweight and people in third world countries would be thriving so it's nonsense and extensive research has proved this, it is scientifically impossible to gain weight if you eat an amount that is lower in calories than you burn.

I don't know but their test is most likely more accurate than a home drug test. By the way, it's tomorrow, not tommarow.
cokes only in your system for 5-7 days so if it's any longer than that since you last used then there's no way there will be any traces left in your system.
Yes you will pass.
You'll be fine! Since I see your into Coke can u answer my question thanks in advance!
If the reattachment surgery is successful, the patient will regain mobility after some months of therapy, sensibility could be reduced due to nerve damage but results might vary from patient to patient. You can also predict that there will be some loss of strength and motor skills. The person would have to re-learn to use the hand. If the reattachment is unsuccessfully then the hand could be paralyzed. Also some reattachments could fail due to lack of blood flow and the hand would have to be amputated again. By the way, the chopper, would go to prison.
movement is pretty much accomplished with muscles in the forearm, the motion transferred to fingers with ligaments. those can be put back together. nerves can't be spliced. you're not getting feeling back, or not much anyway
(1) Probably no. (2) Probably no. The phrase "chop" indicates that the hand is "chopped" off, not medically severed.
yes
Mine is 4 inches long too and I've been told it's too small.
Bro you're good only thots care about size u not gonna hear a woman say "is my vagina tight enough" so why care about your penis size??? .. If any woman tells u different slap her b*tch a** and asking "is my penis long enough?" makes you look insecure asf dude be happy with what u got

No lots of people like the taste of their own áss.
The very fact that you would even ask that question indicates you already know that it's weird
No, many people enjoy tasting themselves during sex as well as during masturbation
Morally, no not really. But it is a little strange and gross.
It's unlikely that watching too much television, reading too many books or staring at a computer screen will permanently damage your eyes. However, all of these activities can cause eyestrain, which isn't something you should ignore. Eyestrain is when your eyes get overtired from too much use. You can get eyestrain from watching television in a dark room, excessive computer use or even driving. Reading in dim light can contribute to eyestrain as well. Any time you intensely focus your eyes on something for a long period, you're at risk for eyestrain.
Yes. I spent days researching this very question. There is a blu lights that is emitted from every electronic screen that goes directly to your eyes. After a certain time spent looking at a screen, you will start to feel the effects (at least most people do). For many, including myself, I feel dryness around my eyes and I find it hard to concentrate. Depending on how close you are to the screen and for a certain period of time, it can definitely hurt your vision. Thankfully, there are options to curb this effect. Companies have created glasses with a filtered lens to cut down the amount of blu light. I use a pair by Pixel Eyewear. Check em out!
That is a great habit if you want to become a 300 pound diabetic with bad circulation and swollen legs. You really have to ask if it's bad ?
YEAH IT'S BAD, THATS WHAT I DID THE LAST 2 YEARS, YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO ME? MY NECK MUSCLES R FKED AND MY VISION HAS GONE DOWN FROM -2 TO -3 AND CONTINUES TO GET WORSE BY THE DAY
Yes it is very bad. You need exercise, you need to MOVE. Yes, it doesn't help your eyesight either!
I found out that my niece is cutting herself. She has been been very isolated and anti-social especially in her teen years. I feel so sad. I want to know what I can do to help her. I suggested to my sister that they get a pet. Can an animal help get her mind off of this? What other things could I suggest to help her take attention away from doing this to herself? She's looking into medication and therapy, but I want to be supportive in my way. She has no siblings. My sister is a single mom trying to help her through this. Any advice or experience?
I am sorry to hear. I would be so sad myself if I learned any of my own sibling's children, whom I love dearly as I am sure you love yours, were hurting and hurting themselves too. You might already be aware as you are probably already searching on your own, but the following site might be helpful, for self-injury support and outreach: http://sioutreach.org/ My prayers are with you and your neice. Peace and God bless. All will be well in the end. If it's not well, it's not the end. Take care.
A pet is a great idea. Dogs are probably the best, but anything will do. If you want to help her, be there for her. It sounds like she is depressed, and depression is almost impossible to get through when you're on your own.
You can buy me a drink.
Yes
No, I only drink on Christmas
A carton of um bongo pls
It is considered a nice gesture. I don't know how I can repay my gratitude.
Just get me a refill on my iced tea
Sweet music to my ears
One for me, and in good karma I'll buy you two. ~Aizen
Sure.
No
They say that exercise is good for your brain. I read that 1 year of regular exercise can give a 70 year old the brain connections of a 30 year old. Exercise improve blood flow in your brain as it does to the rest of your body as well.
Its not doing so great right how. Science has shown that our IQ continues to improve throughout our lives especially if we remain mentally active.
I'm a theologian, not a doctor.
Oh, I hope you didn't turn religious at least.
Most alcoholics are in denial until they hit rock bottom. This is a different experience for every alcoholic or addict. You cannot convince them they are and you cannot convince them to get treatment. They have to do it for themselves.
For many it's shameful to admit that they have a weakness. And if they enjoy the lifestyle and don't see it as a problem they will reject that label.
he likes how he feels and is addicted. don't expect logic or miracles. he will have to hit bottom to make a change. Hard thing to see in a person that you love. Take care of yourself be kind to yourself.
Same with mental illness, any addiction. Most won't get help until they've ruined their lives and they have nothing left.
I used to have an addiction to drinking nail polish, I don't know what's wrong with me but I did. I'm currently not drinking it anymore. As a result I think I have nerve damage, I get tightening sensation over my whole body. It's very painful and I think terminal. I've gone to the doctor but they don't do anything but perhaps if I tell them the cause (toxins from nail polish) they will help me. But I'm really scared like how do I tell a doctor something so weird. advice appreciated
Doctors are paid for knowing strange things. They aren't paid all of that money for knowing somebody has cancer when a machine tells them, or for knowing of somebody has strept throat. They are paid the big bucks to know those weird wacky things, like your addiction.
Whether it's nail polish or nail polish remover you're drinking, that is very, very scary that you do that. Acetone Poisoning: Causes, Symptoms & Diagnosis - Healthline http://www.healthline.com/health/acetone... Nov 3, 2015 ... Acetone poisoning occurs when there's more acetone in your body than the liver ... Acetone is a clear liquid that smells like nail polish remover.
Don't worry sweetie, they have heard it all and then some. Just tell them, a long time ago you did something "Stupid" that you'd rather not say...but you are not feeling well, and that you are getting a tightening sensation over your body that is very painful. He will take it from there.
I'm not a doctor so don't listen to me but I think nail polish remover might help.

It be meanin that your brain works, not well, but it works
Deja vu; a digital voice recording.
it be meanin that they aint deadin
You are watching a video of them when they were alive
you're schizophrenic
demons. trying to lure you.
Maybe she thinks that you aren't serious. Taking the time to post here tells ME that you aren't serious. Why don't you tell your mom what you ARE really serious about? Suicide attempt means that you TRIED to kill yourself, not WANT to in a fit of emotion. Why don't you just tell her? Would you REALLY rather die than talk to your mom?
ER cant help you, you need to talk to your doctor and they arrange mental help but I have had depression for longer than you have been alive and i take daily medication but the only person that can help you is yourself, Good Luck
Call 911. I am sure once the police and ambulance go in there I am sure she will take you serious.
Call 911. They are really nice and will come get you.
Make your own way then
It's not about looking stupid. It's about having the perfect smile :) *I'm still wearing mine and I get them off next month* I'm 17 and before getting them on everyone made braces seem like a big deal, but they're not. I'd rather wear them when I'm in college and finally be able to smile without being embarrassed then to not wear them at all. I knew a few college students in their 20's with braces and they weren't shy or anything. I've even seen adults in their 30's with braces so I think you're pretty lucky.
What are you worried about? The braces or your age? Everybody looks slightly silly when they first get their braces, but that's because they are braces. Not because you are 20. Try invisalign or ceramic braces if you are worried about being a 'tingrin'. Otherwise, just front it out and show the world you're doing something positive.
Nobody will care, besides you. Heck most people wont even notice. So no you wont look stupid at 20 with braces as people much older get them these days
No, my sister is 21 with braces and i want some! They look cool
No my grandma is 50 with braces . It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks!!
everyone looks stupid with braces, i just got them and look like an idiot
Braces make some people look sexy.
No my uncle is almost 40 and has braces . People don't care how you look you know ..
No some girls thinks it's hot
No, I have seen many adults of varying ages wearing them.
Yes masturbation is a normal part of a teenagers life.
Yes its a normal part of life once you begin puberty. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
Given nearly 100% of all teen males masturbate, certainly it is part of the normal development and life experience of teen males.
Yes it is. Everyone did that male or female as part of exploration and experimentation and curiosity. Completely normal.
Yes, totally normal.
absolutely normal.
Once a month.
yes it is for male or female
yep
Assuming both of you are STD free and are both into it, it's fine. There's no more chance of pregnancy so a barrier method won't help. You should not, however, assume both of you are STD free. The rates of these infections are skyrocketing among older populations.
Yes it is perfectly safe , it will have no harmful effects on the woman .
Don't be so silly, how could it be harmful.?
She turns into a goof
i hope you people aren't getting your education from y/a.... i'm not kidding.
Probably not. Vitamin A can have anti-biotic characteristics when used in massive doses - over 100,000 units a day. I take this when I get a cold in my lungs. But never heard that it has any effect on acne - but you could give it a try. You can get 25,000 IU pills of Vit. A - so take 4 or 5 of those a day - and you'd be safe for a week probably. Outside of that, Vit. A becomes toxic.
Only Retin-A prescription strength does, and it has some serious side effects. Not to be taken unless under a doctor's supervision
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
hes gotta go see a doctor ASAP has he ever talked to a doc at all (esp since its been going on for quite some time i assume?) I know I know its embarrasing and he probably doesnt want anyone checking out his rear end, but he really needs to go. Definitely not normal stuff. best of luck.
He needs to see a doctor. He could have internal bleeding of the bowel or hemorriods.
It means he has hemmeroids. Both internal, or external. Tell him to speak to his doctor. A gastroenterologist can help him. My husband used to have this very same problem, and was diagnosed with internal hemmeroids. So have him speak to his doctor.
He really needs to get to a physician right away, could be anemia and something bleeding internally to hemorrhoids. have him take his vitamins and eat lot's of fiber to keep his Bowel Movements soft to see how it looks. If you contact the ED/ER they will say to bring him right in. You may be saving his life.
Sounds like a good time to see a doctor.
He needs to see a doctor.
Talk to him about it and ask him to get checked, this could lead to a serious issue.
I have acne that comes and goes but when it comes its HORRIBKE. I've finally let to trying nothing in my face to see if it worjs, and it was starting to go away. I didn't even touch my face for like 3 days besides like 4 times for itches. Then, someone came up and rubbed 2 crackers in my cheeks. I ran in the bathroom scared and crying. cottilion (dance) is tomorrow and i have almost no acne. I'm pretty sure my tears washed my face before it soaked in.. But is two crackers enough to cause more acne..
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
You need to not only cut out the junk food but also eat foods that purify the body. Green tea and coconut oil (small amount) along with herbs and spices really help. Also consider buying tea tree oil and manuka oil. They are very powerful essential oils that can clean the outside of your skin. But never ingest them or use undiluted. And always test a small amount first to make sure you aren't allergic.
Cut the junk food out, drink more water, sleep earlier, and wash your face with warm water and then cold to get rid of the acne.
And don't ask about the crackers, they were just being an asshole about how caustious I am..
Unfortunately yes - it spreads by contact. Good news - these pads will help you both. Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne.

You can't get acne from him, as you can't "contract acne" from someone. If you are a really really long kisser and you have mild acne, I suppose it can make it worse, but it probably won't matter as much as you might think.
acne isn't contagious lol. I had a boyfriend who had lots of acne & I have a fairly clear face & nothin happened, & we constantly sucked face Lmao. you're good!
YES Acne is contagious and spreads upon contact
Absolutely not. Acne isn't contagious. Its internal.
Not at all. Acne is caused by your body over-producing certain substances under the skin. It cannot be spread by contact, sharing bodily fluids, etc... Mostly it's hormonial
No acne isn't contagious. Other conditions that cause blemishes, such as measles and chicken pox are contagious though
No. But you can get oral herpes or other types of skin infections called impetigo. Its possible you just happened to break out at the same time but you cannot catch acne.
You can't be this stupid!!!! Acne is not a contagious disease transmitted through contact. SMH
No sweetie, you can't catch acne.
Not really. Most cereals are loaded with sugar; and the bran ones tend to be insoluble. For zinc, eat dark leafy greens, mainly. Oysters. Organic bananas. Pumpkin seeds. Plus other fresh fruit and veges.
Raisin Bran is good for everyone. Fiber is a major part of a good diet and its loaded with fiber and other vitamins and minerals. You can check the box to see how much of the daily nutrients it has.
Generally teen boys don't need supplemental zinc.
Bran is not good for your gut. < M
Semen is comprised of two parts; one clear and one opaque. It comes out before ejaculation bc that's how we evolved. It was more advantageous to not have to engage in congress long enough to ejaculate and still spread DNA.
Precum drips out when aroused, it is a clear and syrupy fluid. Semen can also be clear or cloudy but is generally mostly whitish.
Thats normal
the stuff that comes out at first is called pre-*** and it is lubrication for your penis, similar to how females get wet when aroused
prec um
Yes, squats do make it bigger. Although, squaring without weights will require you to do 100+ squats to really feel the burn. It also depends on the type of squat you do. If you let you knees come as forward as possible, you will target your quads and calves instead of your gluteus maximus and minimus. Try squaring really slowly and without leaning forward too much to get a bigger but. Don't let our knees come forward and tyler to use weights or a squat rack if you have access to it. And yes, it will work on a squarish one. :)
my trainer insists that squats work the largest muscle gruops in the body and works the most of the muscle groups compared to any other single exersize you could do. He's huge.
Squats are king, lord & master.
It just means that you didn't bleed. Nothing more, nothing less.
It means nothing. Why would you bleed?
It means nothing. Back in Victorian times, girls did nothing more strenuous than sew, so their hymens were broken the first time they had sexual intercourse.Now, the hymen more often breaks when they play field hockey, lacrosse, or some other strenuous game.
it means that the Myths you have been told are Not true. time for a trip to the library and get some Free books on Female Sexuality and get the Facts
That more than likely means you have an STD. :( Did you use protection? If not you could've given it to your partner too.
your hymen may already have been broken from anything - tampon use, stretching
I am 15 and I have 2 main break out areas my chin and in between my eyebrows (Glabella) and I have had spots in these places for roughly 2 years. I am now just becoming tired of trying new creams or remedies week in week out and nothing working, but now I am wondering whether it would be worth me actually seeing a doctor about it or will I just be wasting theirs and my time?!

If it's been 2 years and you aren't seeing improvement, then it's worth seeing a doctor about, especially if it's bothering you. There are lots of different treatments to try that you can't get over-the-counter.
Erythromycin is a common antibiotic that helps but is available in most countries on prescription only. So, YES, seeing a doctor could help.
Eye color is dependent on multiple genes. Each cell in your body has this gene... a large amount of cells would have to be changed and with such a sensitive organ I don't think it would be worth it. Plus they are trying to find the cure for dieases which is more important than eye color. Be appreciative you have eyesight, and buy reputable colored contacts. I have heard horror stories of cheap ones.
Yes! They should stop studying ways to save people lives and prevent blindness so you can change the color of your eyes. Actually, there are two somewhat risky procedures for doing it now. You have to go to a country that has really lax protection on medical procedures. One involves knocking the pigment off your iris with a laser. The other involves inserting a plastic disc inside your eye.
How the hell would that make life easier? With blue eyes, you are more sensitive to light and at higher risk of cataracts. It certainly doesn't get anyone's attention for dating purposes.
Change eye color OR cure cancer ? Easy decision for a scientist.
Only a small majority of people are vain enough or shallow enough to worry about such a trivial matter.
you should appreciate what you have, nothing is more unattractive than someone who wears too much make up or gets plastic surgery or any of that fake crap they do to change the way they look instant turn off
I'm pretty sure they have.
Colored contacts.... Just saying lol
We can't stimulate fat cells deep enough to affect change via touching or massaging skin.
No. The fat cells can only 'move' if they are physically removed from your body and injected into another part of your body. They aren't free-floating.
Skin Brushing or Fat Transfer Massage. From the name itself, you can guess that the purpose of this type of breast massage is to reduce your
Hahahahahaha No.
Lol! No, that's not how it works. Sorry!!
No!
Benzocaine is an anaesthetic agent from the same overall family as cocaine. When formulated into a cream it is there is low doses and had a numbing effect rather than actual anaesthesia. This is why your condoms with benzocaine numb your penis and remove most of the sensations which lead to climax and ejaculation.
Benzocaine is a stubstance that is similar to local anethstetic. Condoms with benzocaine are designed to numb the top of your penis to delay orgasm.
Benzocaine is an ingredient in pain relief creams and ointments. So if it's in a condom, it is just numbing your penis.
Benzocaine acts as a pain or sensation blocker-- so reduces the sensattions you feel.
It is a numbing medicine. Like when you go to the dentist.
It is an anasthetic. < M
an hr......thats a waste of time
That my dear, is no reason to kill yourself. You have more than a hundred things to live for, not the least of which is a phone or a compliment on your hair. Stop being self centered and Selfish.
USe a gun. Quicker AND more sure. Slit your wrists, and someone will probably find you before you die. That means you will end up in the Meatnal Hospital, possibly tied up and chained to the bed.
nonono, first. pls relax ,stay calm,control your emotion. pls dont suicide. go see a doctor or call the hotline : numbers at http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/ your life is important that the compliment and handphone one day when you got job and can earn money,you can buy a new phone for yourself so pls think positive pls dont suicide, there are punishments for that in alam barzakh (grave dimension) and alam akhirat (final dimension) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhirah https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barzakh

Go ahead then.

Mary is not the queen of anything, she is also not a virgin and she should never be prayed to
I assume many atheists have heard of Mary as depicted in the New Testament, but remember, most of the world's atheists (and theists) have never heard of the new Testament.
NO. Mary is not the mother of God nor queen of angels. She agreed to bear the son of God - that's it. She's in heaven now, worshipping Jesus. She is not listening to your praise to her or your prayers to her. Praise Jesus only!
Whelp not everyone believes in that, so even if they know OF it that doesn't mean they will do it.
YES so that why atheists know marry your cousin
I've read a lot about penis problems over the internet and i think i have frenulum breve.... My frenulum is way too short and whenever im ertected my penis head is never straight. I've enclosed ( http://s32.postimg.org/xrj3oyxph/image.jpg & http://s32.postimg.org/5m2imwp45/image.jpg ) and picutre of my penis and please tell me what is the solution. i'm 17 and im so shy to tell my parents about it, What can be the possible solution about it pls tell me.
You suffer from frenulum breve if your frenulum is too short and tight. It is too tight if it restricts the full retraction of your foreskin or if it causes the glans to be distorted downwards when you have a full erection. The frenulum will not respond to any form of stretching exercise and will not cure itself as you get older - if anything it will get tighter! You need to see a doctor to get the errant frenulum sorted out as otherwise it will interfere with sexual satisfaction and may even rip painfully during sex with very bloody consequences.
Well it is a very rare condition, much overused by circumcision doctors to sell penis mutilations. At 17 this will loosen with age, so I wouldn't rush into surgery just yet. In a year or two you will be able to make decisions without parents. < M
That's a question for your doctor. It is pointless to ask other people online about it.
Well if it doesn't hurt or cause pain during erection then there really isn't a problem.

I change it every day. a muffin with Peanut Butter and Jelly Oatmeal with Cinnamon sugar Apple slices dipped in Kefir Waffles with yogurt or syrup eggs and sausage on the weekends coffee and 20 ounces of water with every Breakfast.
Oatmeal with fresh berries
don't eat breakfast
Toasted bread with butter, and a cup of coffee.
Ice cream.
2 slices of buttered toast and one black coffee with no sugar.
jamon y queso con pollo y salchichas lolol no i like waffles and icecream
Bread and jam
Not really. It will only if you were once drinking, say, 500mL of coke, then drinking 500mL water instead. It will if you drink before a meal because it may keep you fuller and therefore eat less. BUT. Drinking excessive amounts of water is not healthy and is by no means the most effective way to lose weight. Losing weight is mostly dependent on the types of food you consume. Cutting out sugar and decreasing the amount of grains you eat will help.
Not only does this taste great, but I did notice a decrease in my appetite. I love drinking coffee and tea anyways and this has helped me to keep on my weight loss routine. I would suggest Weight Loss Green Store Tea product to all tea drinkers or anyone trying to slow down their food intake .
yes drinking more water is effective for weight lose but for this you have to eat low calories and low sugar food.don't eat four times.when you feel hungry after sometimes of eating food then don't eat anything just drink water.it will satisfy your hunger.
Yes effectively,but you would be care about your daily food,Specially junk foods.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Suicide is not the answer, here's what I think about suicide. Suicide is a free ticket to hell, once you're gone there's no return, your call.
please don't make your questions anonymous, and you have to be brave in life and strive for something, even when people fail you. best of wishes.
Like your gym. More fit on average than the general population, ages ranging up to senior citizen. Some are very attractive, just by being very physically fit.
I go to the gym at my college and the women there are fine af. I'm into athletic girls so most of them appear to be highly attractive in my eyes.
The women at my gym have great -looking bodies but butter-faces, to use an old slang term.
Average, some are GOOD.
I've no idea, I go there to train. I rarely spend time noticing anyone.
Sometimes.
Maybe not, but judging from erections, the baby and the man get turned on the same way by sucking on the boobs. Yet they're not supposed to be sexualized, according to feminists. Hmm. Go figure.
The stimulation of a baby suckling at the breast is meant to create a reaction in a woman's nether regions, as it helps the muscles tighten after childbirth. It's common knowledge and many first time mums freak out when it happens. It's nothing to be ashamed of, and in ages past would have encouraged women to breast feed.
A decade or so ago, a woman called into a radio show to say that she was turned on when her baby suckled. She was, I believe, arrested. Personally, I figure it's probably normal. After all, rewarding breast feeding is why those nerves are there to make it feel good.
Seriously not the way those babies are sucking on breast you try that and you might get smacked. They are sucking hard as hell. It takes some women a good time to get used to it and some even find it quite uncomfortable.
Of course not. Love of a child isn't the same as love of the opposite sex. That's like saying men see kissing their daughter the same as kissing her mother.
Do you as a baby boy ?....no!!!....so ask yourself what is your age !!!! Motherhood is the last bastion of humanity which no gender specific movement can dare to move and supplant ...it is the final evidence that humans still want to love and nurture ....cheers!!!! I grew up becasue a woman nurtured me as she is attached to me for a lifetime as my mother ....as a man i need to find and conquer her younger specimens becasue i never looked up above her feet ....:) Anyways .....females of our species are in an eternal fix ....there is no repreive from us males ....LOL!!!
No, babies don't actually suck. It's completely two different things
no it's not the same. there are sensations, even "good" sensations when you breast feed, but it's not a sexual feeling
Definitely, definitely not the same thing.
I have read that taking a teaspoon of locally produced honey every day for a year helps take the symptoms away. I know a couple of people who have tried it and say it works. I have no idea if it actually does work.
Talk to you doctor about allergy shots. They don't help everyone but they help most people. Another thing to try is to wear a facial mask that filters out most allergens.
Take antihistamines, diphenhydramine.
An atheists colleague says he's about to 'pop the question' to his live in boyfriend, and that he's really worried if he will get...a 'happy' answer as his bf seems to not want to settle down and raise a family yet. Who is insane here? Who is insane here? The compulsive "Liar for Jesus" one imagines! What do you think Hinny-babes?
Neither party is insane. The doubt will be there until he gets a yes or no answer. Your friend will usually know the answer by the reaction of the boyfriend.
I don't know about insane but you are certainly the inane one.
Tell him if he wants any wonders or miracles to happen in his real life, he should resort to prayers. Let him pray honestly and sincerely with implicit faith, unshakable belief and unflinching devotion. His genuine prayers will not go waste It will be suitably rewarded. Let him not worry.
This well worded question should wake a few up and cause them to seek some form of treatment. Well done you.
Judging by how you blab nonsense and then answer it yourself, you are the insane one here, hinni. Schizophrenia is my guess.
We all know who the real nutcase is, hini.
I keep smoking a pack a day because Hitler would not like it.
NO: EXCESSIVE smoking is bad for your health, that's the difference If you smoke a cigarette a day for example, it's probably not going to do much damage, but if you smoke a pack or more per day...that's a different story.
Smoking weed is good, smoking tobacco is bad
Yes, you are correct. Smoking is healthy and can actually benefit your body. 🙂🔫
You figure that all the bad things he did in his life, that eventually the odds are that something would turn-out good.
I'm skinny but I got a lot of belly fat. When I'm sitting, there's like a triple rows of belly fat and it sweats under it and I'm uncomfortable with it. Some people say it is a baby fat. But I'm 17 now turning 18 Male, I'm worried because I want to lose weight just to burn these belly fats but the other problem is I'm skinny. If I lose weight then I will be more skinnier.
Everything they are telling isn't how it works, You need to properly track your calories and lift weights to build up the muscle, if you have no muscle your body is gonna hold onto the fat, and doing crunches will help build muscle but you wont lose fat like that
Do some excercises. Belly fats won't go away unless you excercise or get liposuction.
do abs exercises, it worked for me! do this plan and you should lose the belly fat in 1 or 2 weeks at most!
Just do exercises for abs. It'll help
Get anew doctor, that is nowhere near overweight, it's smack dab in the middle of normal.
Either you misunderstood what he said or he's insane and shouldn't be allowed to practice medicine because he could really damage people's health. He would be right to say those things if your current height was the same as in 2009 (surely you were much shorter back then), but now your height and weight match perfectly. You aren't overweight at all and you must not lose 30 pounds or even half of it.
Frankly, you doctor is wrong and anyone could see that because you being 96 pounds would be very unhealthy. Considering I am a 5'5 female and weigh 108 my BMI says I'm a bit close to underweight. So calculate your BMI online to get an estimate yourself. Look in the mirror as well, do you look healthy? Is that how you want to look?
I JUST WANT TO SIMPLY ASK BOTTOM LINE why is mental health stigmatized so much in society my principle gave me so much **** told im mental made fun of me because i couldnt finish my junior year to much stress depression its like why cant people look past judgement they dont know what ive been through thought got me this way also i went to the doctor the other day and told her i wasnt using protecting mind i say im 26 and gave her nurse this snotty like like wtf is she doing? y did she do that
It only took you 8 years to get a 2 year degree AND you some how managed to not learn any punctuation at all! I'm completely overlooking your other issues with your birth language. That's quite an accomplishment. Go ahead, brag some more. I like it when you brag. It makes my day. :)
Your idea is good. You have a valid point. Everything was predestined. It is not a man made plan. If you want some best solutions for your present problem, you should not feel shy or hesitant to ask a solid question here.
Congratulations!
I would run like hell from a man who had a penis girth that was as big as a Red Bull can or a Coke can! That sounds painful just to THINK about it!
Cardboard roll is good. I've had as big as a redbull can, but I personally like 6" around or less. Coke can would kill us all, lol.
Just reading the answers. :) So far mine is too thin! I know it's too short too!!
Cardboard roll..coke can is scary big
toilet paper roll is about what i'd like
No real average at age 13 since guys that age are all over the place in terms of size. But growing well, just have patience. Major growth will continue to occur through 14.
As I grew older I realized that I was no longer good in bed as I used to before and that actually made me sad and this Prolargentsize product can be used by adults of all age group s which has made me feel amazing. I don't only have increased stamina, but I also feel younger.
You will be at max size by about 15 or 16.
You're already above average for your age.
If your intention is starving yourself to lose weight then you're sadly misinformed, when you starve yourself that is your body eating at its reserves (the fat). Once you begin eating again your body will still be in this emergency mode of starvation and it will turn anything you eat back into fat, gaining all the weight you lost from starving yourself anyway and in addition this has very negative affects on your metabolism which can be permanent in serious cases. There is better ways to lose weight.
Starving yourself messes up your metabolism so whenever you eat, you gain weight. Pretty simple biology. You have to eat normally, 3 meals a day, gain a little to get your metabolism back on track, then you can diet a healthy way to lose weight. But you won't do that.
I'm sorry that you feel like starving yourself is an option. Maybe instead of cutting out all food, look up some foods with health benefits and use those healthier snack options. Also, working out makes you feel a lot better, trust me. I like taking classes at my gym, it helps me stay motivated!
Not eating for 2 weeks WILL make you sick
If you are gaining weight while eating healthy then you should have your thyroid checked. That could be your problem.
It's average size. Congrats.
Your penis is not small at all. The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches so your penis at 5 1/2 inches is perfect.
Why was billy bob looking at your erection. That is weird. But average is 5.16 inches so you are not small at 5.5 inches.
Almost average. But small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
This Prolargentsize product is wonderful, I implore whoever that is wiling to give it a trial to go ahead. Quite and perfectly sure that a trial will convince you.
Why you show Billy yo weenie? You two real GOOD friends, are ya? *snicker*
actually 5.5 is the average size. anything over is big, anything under is small.
Keep your genitals to yourself.
I have been a cheerleader my whole life. Today was tryouts. I will be a sophomore and its very difficult for a sophomore to make varsity. After the tryout, I got an email saying I made varsity. I was beyond excited and happy which is great because I just got out of an extreme depression. Five minutes later I got another email saying I didn't actually make varsity and Im so upset right now
You should be so happy. Very few make the JV Squad. You are too hard on yourself and you will become your own worst enemy if you keep it up. Be thankful for the little things in life. How many girls failed to become cheerleaders? You've got to quit beating yourself up. Be thankful for what you have accomplished. Learn to love yourself as well as love others. If you don't, self-hatred is a horrible thing that turns into mental disorders, anxiety and depression. Don't go down that road.
Don't worry! JV is great too! Just keep on working hard and eventually you'll be on the varsity team! Good luck!!! :)
Report this to the school principal. It's his/her responsibility to provide a safe learning atmosphere.---- Tell him how elated you were and how your hopes were dashed when you got the 2nd email...and how hurtful an humiliating that way. They can't do that to you!!
I would have a screaming stomping fit if I couldn't buy sugary drinks and candy bars when I miscalculate my insulin dosage!! What some of these people do gooding are doing to the ones of us who need a sugar fix occasionally is criminal and need to be sued My glucose testing sometimes goes way below where the endocrinologist says it should be, and I am in immenent danger of going into a diabetic coma! 35 is very very low!! and a coke at that time is excellent for bringing it back up to around 75 Narrow minded do gooders who think one size fits all are so mistaken!!
I think I would have just eaten the sugar. Let it melt in your mouth. Sugar free soda is yukky....my opinion, LOL
Why do you need sugar? No it wont do you any harm unless you are diabetic but it wont taste good.
Not at all, ma'am. You'll be absolutely fine.
no
dunno but who cares
Eat the right foods and the right amount of it. As much as possible don't eat junk foods, processed foods, sodium and sugar. Eat natural foods like fish, fruits, vegetable, lean meat and chicken meat. Make sure you know how much calories you should intake. I intake about 1800 calories a day. Goodluck!
Eat these foods only... beef, hamburger (no bun), pork, hot dogs (no bun), chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, butter, nuts, green salad with a little dressing. Pick one day a week, the same day and eat other foods in moderation. When you get discouraged, ask your self "what do I hate worse, being fat or no carbs".
Make sure you are eating well. If you need help in that department have a look at the following plan. Free McDougall Healthy Eating Program - https://www.drmcdougall.com/health/educa...

Please call the doctor's office back and talk to them. You have to trust that there is an important reason this combination of medications was prescribed and the doctor should be able to recommend a pharmacy where all of your prescriptions can be filled. Also, understand that these drugs don't work overnight. The doctor should have told you exactly how long it would take for you to start noticing a difference. You may also want to look into regular counseling or therapy sessions. Medication combined with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is extremely effective. Good luck and don't give up.
Fluoxetine & lustral are serotonin reuptake inhibitors & risperidone is a dopamine antagonist. In general serotonin regulates dopamine & the two systems (dopaminergic & serotonergic) require certain factors to maintain balance such as vitamin D, magnesium & thiamine (B1) -- all relatively common deficiencies.
Where are you looking? It is a very common medication.... every pharmacist should have it.
Hazel eyes float between brown and green. Sounds like yours are some floating variety of blue.
Grey but I would see how it could reflect colors like blue and even green.
It sounds like your eyes are most likely blue with a hint of green.
Which one?
Sorry I forgot to give the picture
Can i see a pic

I never name my poo because eventually I have to flush them, and it makes me very sad.
I am sick to death of freaks like you.
I honestly cannot top that.
hahahahha i dont look at my poop
Some soreness the first time is normal, especially if you weren't lubricated enough.
popped your cherry. it's normal
If it's up your ârse ...yes
Yeah, but not all the time. If he popped your cherry, it's normal.
only if the complete virgin has gone to a clinic and paid thousands of dollars for artificial insemination or had embryos implanted. otherwise no. not even if the virgin did have a crush on anyone. you don't get pregnant from having a crush
I've heard that it happened once before to a woman about 2000 years ago, in a town called Nazareth.
Unless you went to get artificial insemination, no. You're probably having an issue with your ovaries and should talk to your doctor as soon as possible.
unless you get artificial insemination or you're the Virgin Mary
No. Learn about how a baby is made to stop having to ask embarrassing questions.
Not unless you were visited by the Holy Spirit, like Mary.
Not under the conditions you describe. There is such a thing as artificial insemination.
A better question: Can anyone actually be this stupid?
that has only happened to one woman in history. i think her name was Mary....
It could just be your hormones, though it does sound like you could have Bipolar Disorder. Talk to your family or teachers or anyone you trust about it so they can get you to a doctor and you can do some exams that will determine whether or not you have it. Good luck. Stay strong
it does sound like it, and if it's affecting your life this much i definitely strongly suggest getting it professionally diagnosed. getting medication for it could help a lot, i know a dad who was bipolar and it messed with their whole family for a couple years until he got a diagnosis and medication. not saying that will be you but that treating it will help drastically in most cases
I'm not a psychiatrist, but I would diagnose bipolar disorder, if I were.
I hate myself. My self esteem is sh!t. My parents think I'm a disappointment. My teachers are sick of me having panic attacks in class because of my social anxiety. I screwed up with my friends and they won't talk to me. I'm bisexual. I cut. I hate my life and I just want to die. I just need a reason to keep breathing and to keep holding on. I'm a mess and I don't know why I should keep going.
Let's hang out
Remember, as long as you are still breathing it is never too late to start a new beginning.

PCOS sounds a complicated issue. If she is taking the pill not only to prevent pregnancy but also to control the effects of her condition then she should not stop without consulting a doctor. Losing weight can help to reduce the effects of PCOS and going off the pill isnt necessarily going to help. But if she eats less and exercises more then it should be possible for her to lose weight even on the pill. The pill is a very reliable at preventing pregnancy and if you are in a sexual relationship you dont want to do without it or some other method of female contraception.
SHUT UP, you prick! You are not her doctor, and only he can say if and when she should go off her medication. She is taking this medication not for the primary purpose of birth control, but to control PCOS, which is a very painful condition and can often lead to weight gain just by itself. You are saying you would rather she be slim enough to meet your specifications and have pain every day, rather than continue her medication and stay healthy, but gain a few pounds as a result. Is that it? If so, that is proof that you care nothing about her; you are only thinking of yourself and what you want.
If you only want her when she is slim this relationshp is not going anywhere because looks dont last forever but personality does, she needs to take the pill to control her pcos and it is unlikely she will ever have any kids so if this is what you want move on and find someone who you can control
Well first of all that's her choice. If the fact that she's 'gained' a bit of weight is your problem you better re-evaluate your relationship. If you want her off the pill them come clean to her with your reasons but I wouldn't expect it to go well and drama free.
You don't. If it caused weight gain, it will cause weight gain when she gets back on it. She probably prefers the extra weight over the pcos symptoms. Medications should not be taken "off and on" like that either.
Are you kidding? PCOS can be very painful and troublesome, and can lead to weight gain all by itself. Are you suggesting she stop a medication that makes her condition better just because she gained a bit of weight? Perhaps you should look at your attitude. You are putting her weight before her HEALTH.
Pads
I'm 12 and I use pads but I might start with tampons for the summer
Pads. Been using them for 35 years.
Pads I wanna use tampons but my mom said I don't need them 😒
Well i used to use pads but for the last few weeks I've had to wear nappy things as bleeding when not on period 24/7
I have a super heavy flow sometimes so I have to use a tampon and a pad at the same time! if sucks..
my wife has heavy irregular periods and she has to use double pads
I understand the purpose for not masturbating for a day or two to have a better orgasm the next time, but what's the purpose of stopping all together? Go ahead and masturbate. I have experienced what it was like not to masturbate for a few weeks. You know what happened? After a while, I've lost my sexual urges and my libido(though, I got it back when I MADE myself to masturbate) You don't want to lose your erections. Enjoy the urge you have right now, and jerk it.
There's a reason the urge is so strong. Give in to it. It's natural. It's healthy. Everyone does it. Enjoy.
Why stop? Natural and normal urge. Plus lots of fun.
There's nothing wrong with it. You don't have to stop.
Why stop. NoFap is rubbish. < M
I think you need to put her indiscretion behind you if at all possible because your wife had to be in a lot of pain and having sex probably was the best thing she could do to help relieve the stress she was under. You said she didn't do anything to comfort you, if you were in that much pain, can you imagine the pain she must've been having and I can't believe you even mentioning that. To me your loss couldn't come close to matching her loss, she had had that child inside her body for months. I think you need to get down on your knees and beg her to forgive you.
You need to get together with her and collectively decide if you want to repair your wounded marriage. If you do, then it's a matter of how and whether you can cooperate with each other toward that goal. If you can't, then things will continue to deteriorate and eventually destroy your marriage.
Look, dude. You two suffered a death of your child!!!! You're both grieving. Unfortunately, many couples end up divorcing because of a death of a child because they grieve silently by themselves instead of together. You need to talk to her about your grief, ask her about yours, cry together, grieve together. Talk about all the things you wanted to do with your child, all the disappointment you feel, sadness, anger, etc.
My condolences for your loss. You two have suffered a horrific personal tragedy and your skills/abilities/communication to deal with it is overwhelmed. I think an outside party (couples counseling) that can objectively lead you through this to a place where you two have sufficient trust to resolve these problems independently.
You two need to get into marriage counseling asap. She could also benefit from some grief counseling over the pregnancy loss.
I'm only 15 years old so I know this would be very rare for me to have but I think I have inflammatory breast cancer. I noticed about a week ago that my left breast is bigger than the other. I think I would of noticed this before so I think it swelled recently. I have had minor pain in my left breast and really bad pain under my left rib cage. I think I'm dying help
Having one breast larger than the other is NORMAL. Swelling of breasts in your teens is PUBERTY. Your risk of ANY type of breast cancer at your age is 1 in 1.3 million and Inflammatory Breast cancer is one of the less common types of breast cancer so your risk of that is about 1 in 100million. What you are describing sounds NOTHING like breast cancer. Talk to a parent or guardian for reassurance.
We all have one breast bigger than the other and your pain is probably something to do with a tight bra or simular so stop stressing but if you are worried go ask your doctor. Good Luck
Sigh......pain is not a symptom of cancer. One boob bigger than the other is completely normal. I think you're overly imaginative and overreacting.
Hey, congratulations, you have a horrible and completely incurable disease. It is called puberty and everyone gets it.
Sounds like an infection. Tell your mother.
I've had a retainer for quite a while now and from now on I only have to wear it for 12 hours everyday so I take them out at 7am and put them in at 7pm.. So you'll be fine!! It will take quite a while for your teeth to shift (maybe 2-3 days)
Nothing. It's not like the teeth are going to shift that fast. I'm supposed to be wearing a retainer constantly, but don't do due sipping on Mountain Dew at work.
not much, but wear it as much as you can. Teeth tend to move toward the center as we age so your once-straight teeth can become crooked again if you don't wear your retainer. Use it every night for the rest of your life.
Nothing really should happen. You should be fine to do. I wear my retainer every night but not during the morning and afternoon.
I'm 13 and no Lie I am 7 inches
It is average. I am 15, 6 inches soft, 9 inches hard
It's average
Your penis at 5 1/2 inches is bigger than average for your age.
You have got a perfect sized cock . It may grow up to 8 inches by the time you are 18 yearns . Mean while concentrate on your studies and enjoy. Regards.
you are 13 !
Yes, you're extremely normal. Guys all grow differently.
That is a good size. Now go find a woman
Normal. Just ok... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Above adult average so doing fine.

1) Most fake sugars have been shown to cause cancer. 2) To some extent (not completely but still) your body reacts to fake sugar just as it were real sugar. So even if it contains zero calories it can trigger some hormonal signals which cause your body to stock some fat. This excessive stocking, on top of making you fat, will reduce your glycemia. It can make you feel weak and it can be a problem if you have diabetes. 1 or 2 cans a day is probably OK. Some people drink one litre a day and then it's pretty bad.
Yes - there was just a study released not long ago which says that the fake sweetener causes obesity much like the sugar does. Apparently the fake sweetener triggers the same massive release of insulin that sugar does. This stuff is deadly....... and it's especially hard on kids.
yes it's bad for you and it contains almost the same amount of sugar as regular soda
I wouldn't worry about it, drink your soda.
It is in excess (over .5 can per meal). Has so many chemiacals
yes. aspartame promotes blood sugar problems and is neurotoxic.
Well there is no reason to be embarrassed by the size of your penis one way or the other although if you must be having a big one is much better than having a smaller one.
No, you do not need to be embarrassed by your large penis.
Some guys really want to have large penis but they are unlucky, and you are one luckier... Theres no need to be embarassed about it.
Just cut off several inches. A butcher knife and chopping block is all you'll need to fix this problem.
if you learn to use it properly what's to be embarrassed about
Most guys would be thrilled to have your problem, not to mention the girls you will be with. You will be very popular!
grow big muscles, so it'll look smaller
OK. What is the actual question?
whats your question
Yes
Yes. Quit while you can. If you don't quit now, it will be too late. You are extremely lucky if you can stop smoking right now, there are some old folks who would have given anything to stop smoking cigarettes.
Yes. Within 3 years you are nearly as likely as a non smoker to get it.
yes, your lungs begin to heal as soon as you quit
yes
Depression is a sign that something isn't right. Search yourself to find the answers. If you see a doctor they will not help but, only put you on meds that don't cure only make things worse by turning you into a robot. http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articl...
You have to get to the underlying reason for it - and this is some unconscious conflict. You don't know what it is.... it's not conscious. It's lost in the past - it's "forgotten". That's what keeps the depression going. So you talk it out. Mostly it's anger left over from childhood. And no - you don't need drugs. You need to talk to intelligent people and use your head. Unfortunately as you look around you find very few intelligent people who can even stay on topic. First off don't believe it's hopeless and that you need drugs. That's the first trap to avoid.
It doesn't really get cured, you learn to improve and manage it. Try cognitive behavioral therapy - short term, about 8 sessions, and proven effective for depression.
Depression is not something that can be cured, it is something that will fade and can be minimized. I would visit a doctor to get anti-depressants and visit a psychologist to work with until you are feeling better.
Remedy may be relied upon to control amazing wretchedness, and arrangement will decidedly be required for bipolar issue. Psychotherapy can in like manner be incredibly profitable. For convincing unhappiness, reflection should simply be used as a comparing rehearse, disregarding the way that for more minor sadness consideration can helpfully be used alone.
Hi so as 5 inches and 1 inch wide is the normal average what is the issue here. 2 inches is more than enough to get a woman pregnant.
what happened to you being a 14 y/o with a 6" dick on that other post mate?
Normal. No good for me... For you - sometimes - that is seldom. You know healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...
perfect! large penises are painful and small arent so appealing to the female eye
it's fine
good size, will do the job fine.
if you have to ask....
I seen a man and woman going at it hard in a bathroom stall. You could see through the small space between the door and wall he had her pinned up against the wall. I just laughed under my breath and left. But some other men there (it was in the men's room) were playing peeping Tom lol. And then the bouncer joined them. F*cking pervert peeping Tom's. This guy I know who happens to be a bouncer at that same bar said he's seen that before on a few previous occasions and that he kicks open the door on them for all to see. I always thought he was kind of a dl*k.
Omg yes. The worst thing I ever saw was these two people in the back on the wall having full on sex with their pants down. I felt so badly for them because I knew they were out of their mind drunk. It was awful for everyone. I prayed they wouldn't remember in he morning.
Who gives a sh*t? And you call other people peeping toms but you were there looking through the gap and laughing. Why were you laughing? That makes no sense.
you're OBVIOUSLY just as BIG a peeping tom perv
Try to be more self-confident slowly, looking in the mirror and telling yourself you're beautiful the way you are. You should try exercising or yoga, since it releases endorphins which make you happy and more self-confident about yourself. If you're so insecure about your glasses, wear contacts. Freckles are okay, but if it makes you feel better, there's foundation to cover it. However, you need to love yourself the way you are! Own your body!
At least ugly people like you would look good frying in the electric chair with a hood over their heads so we can't see their ugly faces! Then we good looking people will get to eat your barbecue afterwards.
Obviously u uninformed young kid. Got libraries where you live ? Plenty of books on Failures (ugly) people who choose to become Successful people. We call them Biographies. Read and get educated.
You need to eat more fiber and drink more water. Eat at least 26g/day of fiber. Increase fiber and you will have to increase your water consumption. It ttakes about a week to feel the difference.
It is constipation . Start drinking hot glass of milk at sleep time
I've tried this it started working then stopped again?
you are what you eat.. change your diet so it contains a lot more fiber and less meat
Any weight between 102 and 136 is both normal, sexy AND healthy. For your gender and height. Under 102 is underweight, unhealthy, unsexy, and skinny. Over 136 is overweight, unhealthy, unsexy, and too heavy.
im a 15 y.o female and only 5ft, i weigh like 130 and im told that im at a healthy weight for my age and height. so idk if you can base off of that but maybe ask a nurse or gym teacher or doctor
you should be 130 lbs so you can have some curves. remember to use the machines at the gym to keep your body shapely

Why are you asking in R&S on medical questions? more to the point why don't you go the doctors and ask a qualified person
Sorry, no such thing as forget to breathe. That's just holding your breath. Breathing is instinct, we do it while we are asleep. There is no thinking about it.
You might have bradycardia. I suggest you to go to the doctor immediately because this disease is not good. Good luck my friend!
Nobody here knows because We. Are. Not. Doctors.
Anxiety. Talk to your doctor.
Heart Attack.
Have someone take you to a doctor.
Did you mean HELP?
Idk, the section sometimes changes by itself
Huh....? That's completely normal. Just because you have pubic hair doesn't mean your voice opposed to be deep. There is no such thing as a set schedule that pertains to everyone. We all develop at different rates and on different schedules. My voice was pretty deep when I was 14 or 15 but I had very little pubic hair. And NO pit hair at all.
Few guys have their voices "break" but all guys get pubic hair and armpit hair. Most guys get pubes 11-13. Sounds normal.
Yet. There are plenty of time for your body to undergo changes, you might just started puberty and this is the right time for it... How voice changes doesnt necessary at certain age and some guy are starting to develop some just finished changing... Just a little more time and i assure you itll deepen. Enjoy your time, you might miss it.
That's exactly where I am. Don't worry about that, your voice will get deeper
Puberty takes several years to complete, not several months. Be patient.
Yes, that is completely normal.
normal
Cones and rods have nothing to do with it. The phenomenon you speak of does not happen much in your younger days but happens much more often as you get older. The reason for this is that the central part of your eye has the most damage and therefore cannot see as good as the rest of your eye so especially in low-light conditions this is very noticeable. That is why it is often necessary to use your peripheral vision in the dark
I have not noticed that. Your age? It might be good to get a full eye exam. This might be a sign of macular degeneration. Probably not, just be safe with an exam.
Maybe it's just you.
I've never noticed that.
Haven't tried that thanks.
5.5 inches maybe a bit more if still growing. Most guys reach full adult erect length by 14 to 15 then final girth by 16. But average is only 5.16 inches, and despite their claims, most teen boys are NOT 7 or 8 inches. Teen boys lie.
Theres no sure way of knowing but there is one way of predicting, according to a study, average penis size for a 14 year old is 4.53 inches and according to that same study, its 5.71 for an 18 year old, so taking into account that from 14 to 18, the average penis size grew 1.18 inches, so from 5.5 inches, you will be approximately 6.68 inches but you could also be ahead in puberty for the average 14 year old, so no sure way of knowing again
Well you have a good size currently for an adult. With that said you can continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties. NO one could tell you what your final size would be because it might stay the same or you could grow another 3 inches. Time will tell for sure.
Since I'm female, I haven't personally tried it but my husband is liking it so far. He's always thought he was too small, though I never complained. But he seems happier now with the "issue" and it's only been a couple of days. Hopefully, Prolargentsize will continue to help him feel stronger and bigger in this area.
We don't know. Probably bigger than it is now = and it is perfectly "usable" now. < M
5.5 is the average... you might be done
It's funny to see the stupid try to talk down to us.
A person says LOL when they come across something especially funny. It is very entertaining to hear someone say that the "bible [is] true because they just know" because that is entirely and completely illogical.
I can't speak for other atheists, but it's often because I actually DID laugh out loud at their foolishness. I mean, just saying something is true does not make it so -- even if you "back it up" with "because I know".
I respect your beliefs, but to answer your question, you saying the bible is true because you just know is like me saying I know the Easter Bunny is real just because I know. It sounds ridiculous on both ends, but that's just the opinion everyone is granted
Because atheists think that the Bible is worthless, but the reality is it is priceless. It's kind of sad though, because it may be why some wail and gnash their teeth on the day of judgement, realizing they had mocked something that turned out to be true.
I "know" that I am gorgeous just as Christians just "know" that the bible is "true". Mo Ma and Grandma
That is a big IF since, question is biased toward a snarky outcome.
Nice story troll.
I can see why you posted this in the mental health section.
Do you know your body fat %? That'll help you determine how much of that weight is fat and how much is muscle/bone, etc... But with just those 2 factors your body mass index(BMI) is slightly under the "overweight" category.
In response to the other person BMI isn't accurate, BMI only measures your height and weight is doesn't count your muscle mass, if you have rolls or if you can physically see that you are chubby then your are
Nope you're actually a very normal weight. :)
I think that's in the normal range. Try hip, waist ratio.
Yup. Look up BMI calculator.
I think you're perfectly fine, really. It also depends on your gender, age, and the way the weight is distributed.
Is it that small when erected? That's normal but, kinda rare and weird.
I would say your ok. Don't worry it will grow a lot more. If that is non react that yeah your all set don't worry at all.
Theres no "normal" size depends on your genetics ... I wouldnt worry to mucb if i was you your still Young hunny
only if you are a dwarf

This is fake
They have no medical experience, they never got checked by doctors, and they see something on the computer and claim they have Asperger's, they are "high-functioning" autistic, or they have a "sensitivity" to EMFs, or fibromyalgia. They even went as far to tell the doctors, if they DO visit, to give them medication they see on commercials. Why do people do this? They can't even spell Asperger's from the questions I see on Yahoo answers. You think if they really have those "conditions", they would know how to spell those.
because they're desperate for an explanation of their problems that doesn't point to it being their fault, so instead they go on wikipedia and web-md and only look at the symptoms they have while ignoring the rest. They find some condition that they think they share a symptom or two with and then pretend to have it and then pretend that they can't be held accountable for the **** they do or say because it's totally just their illness causing all the problems in their life You can usually spot them by how proud they are of it
Its most likely for attention. Many people who have autism depression fibromyalgia tourettes syndrome, etc dont go and admit it online constantly. People who self diagnose want someone to feel bad or give them attention. Some people even fake these things sometimes. I know people who faked having cancer, and another person who faked having rett syndrome.
Sometimes you just use common sense. I've been misdiagnosed several times, despite telling them I knew what I had. But they had a similar attitude. Most recently it resulted in emergency surgery. If high have basic medical and anatomical knowledge it's not much of a challenge.
Some people are pathetic and just want to have an disorder because they think people will feel bad for them. They want attention and they think it's cool. It's so sad that people actually do this but this is a reason
Because most people are stupid enough to believe just about anything they see on the internet and on youtube. The Internet lies a lot and so does youtube on a lot of things.
I think so too honestly I've gotten more things right before the doctors ever did.
I just search around a lot because I'd never tell my parents for multiple reasons, and this site is one of the few things helping me. Idk if something's wrong with me but idk what to do. Sorry if diagnosing myself inconvenients you, and ik it's annoying how people go 'omg I hate blah blah I'm sooo OCD', but some of us maybe do have problems. Idk where I went or where I'm going with this. I'm just tired.
Yes
Several things contributed to the event. Anxiety, pain, your feelings for your seducer, whether you were sufficiently aroused, etc. I doubt that it's normal to have good sex on the first go.
Yeah it is normal.
my first time was actually a good experience, but every story i hear, especially from women, is that their first time was painful, or lackluster. idk i guess i was lucky.
The term "infertile" means a male does not produce sperm. But only way to know a male is infertile is to have a semen analysis where a lab technician will examine the semen under a microscope to see if any sperm are present, and how many. There is no visible way to determine a male is infertile- sperm cannot be seen without a microscope-- smallest human cells.
an infertile man can still ejaculate if that is what you are asking. through sex and through masturbation. Just because he still has semen does not mean there are any sperm in it being infertile does not always mean having no sperm it can mean low sperm count with poor motility. the number of sperm per ejaculation is not affected by whether that ejaculation comes through sex or masturbation.
I'm guessing you don't know what the word "infertile" means... LMAO
no they can't if there sterile
No, they cannot.
no
Shiloh Greyson
Toby Greyson.
Best names Greyson and Toby for a first/middle name combination I'd go with Toby Greyson.
Toby Greyson is the most normal
I've only ever heard Shiloh used as a girl's name Cassiel is a terrible name; too close to Cassie / Cassandra (again, girl names) Ravus? Really?
Greyson Toby or Toby Greyson
Toby - Toby Shiloh
Cavus Greyson. It sounds cool, I think it's pretty unique, and it's not silly or anything so he wouldn't get made fun of for it. (Pronounced: Cay-vuss)
I like those individually but none of them really sound good together in my opinion
Motivation,consistency and a nice workout routine.As well as a diet of healthy, nutritious food.
cut down on your size of food portions , eat fruit & veg , go swimming , jogging, speed walking ,cycling , dog walking ,dance along to music when in your home ,press ups , sit ups, skipping , .
Please don't tell me to exercise more because I am a construction worker.
I'm 11 years old and I really love helping people with their problems, so I figured I should become a councilor/therapist for Depression, Anger, Anxiety, ect. I'm usually really good at making people feel better when they're sad. What should I study? And what education is required the most for being a Councilor/Therapist?
You can do anything from a 4 year degree in social work and become a therapist or you can go another 4 to 6 years and get a PhD and become a psychologist.... either way requires college and the more college you attend, the more you get paid and the more severe patients you work with.
You'll at least need a Master's degree. Lots of college.
What you have are Hemmeroids. Nothing more. Very common. In fact I have had mine for 35 years. You have had every test imaginable there is nothing to worry about.
Because your constipated you. Have hemmorhoids. Take tablespoon of olive oil everynight before bed. Soupspoon. to will help your stools glide through. Important to eat fruits and raw and cooked vegs. This gives you ruffage. Meat gives no ruffage.
Sounds like hemmorhoids or a fissure. Get and stay well-hydrated, eat lots of fruit/veggies/fibre, and exercise. Broccoli is your friend.
In the grand scheme of human history, 50 years is no time at all. What makes you think there will never be cures? Cancer research has already yielded some very positive results. 100 years ago, people invariably died of cancer, but now they are often living for years. Alzheimer's has been subject to research for less time, but I have no doubt that we'll make progress there, too. You and I may not live to see cures, but I think they'll be found eventually.
Guess why they'll never have a cure for Diabetes. Presently Insulin sales amount to $10 billion a year and with a cure, that money vanishes. Drug companies will help you treat symptoms or manage a disease, but not cure a it. Antibiotics is the only exception. .
Well, it's like this. We can easily prevent both those diseases. The reason people get them is because of how we live, and because of the toxic stew we've made of our world. Once the diseases have manifest, then it becomes more difficult, but it's still possible to reverse them. But if they're looking for some magic bullet, some pill, they're not going to find that. It's a matter of changing how we live. But the medical industry is making enormous profits out of people's sickness, and the people in charge of it don't want people to know how we can prevent and heal disease.
Many Cancers can in fact be cured. And treatments have gotten better as well.
Washington funded $4.8 billion in cancer research in the 2013 fiscal year, and funding has averaged $4.9 billion over the past six years
Cancers are cured everyday
you just answered your own question right there and why cure something when people spend billions of dollars for treatment
$600 billion? Evidence?
By the way, what is your real question here and now. Why don't you use Agarbathi or deodorant to remove such bad smell. If you raise a solid question, I will give you few tips. I am sorry, it is an ointment. It is not a ********. If you apply, you will get back your original or natural mental health. Solution is out of stock. Instead, you can get it in tablet form, capsule form or powder form.
How the hell can a room smell like masturbation?? The scent of semen is weak.
What are you doing with your ejaculated sperm. It sounds like you are using tissues or rags to clean up your sperm and leaving them in the room.
never smelled masterbation, but an intresting thought
Your room is probably just dirty and you need to launder your bed linens, clean the carpet or wash the floor.
Then get a girlfriend. < M
I think it's always safer to avoid introducing bacteria into an area with an unhealed wound no matter what the circumstances are. It may be best to wait until your mouth has healed. However, if you are really scared to do this in general, maybe re-think if you are ready or not. It sounds like your boyfriend is being very cool about it, so don't pressure yourself into doing something you aren't ready for. And yes, especially wait until your mouth has healed completely. :)
Someone has to HAVE herpes for you to GET herpes. If your boyfriend has herpes, then yes, you should worry. Sex doesn't create STDs between two people who don't have them. Sex transmits existing infections from one person to another.
Although all of the other answers are correct - anyone can have high blood pressure, obesity can certainly cause high blood pressure (usually connected with high cholesterol due to bad diet etc).
Weight has nothing to do with high blood pressure. I weight 107 lbs. and I have high blood pressure.
Five to 10 pounds
hb is caused by many factors. weight is one of them, heredity another
It can occur in any size, I am thin and I have it.
i have been training for year now and never have i ever reached 215 bpm. Just thought i would check, thank you guys. what scared me more was that it went upto 215 and than in 5 seconds dropped to 90. it was kinda scary tho. i felt like i was about to pass out or something,
it's normal because your working out
Maybe for you, but no, it's not normal. Almost sounds like a tachycardia.
not much difference, are you trying to create a problem?
Of course! You can tell your therapist anything. I assure you, no matter what you tell them, they've heard worse. Your little fantasy is not that shocking at all. Telling your therapist that would certainly help him or her treat your psychosis.
You are sick. Find an endocrinologist and have your hormone levels tested. Possibly you just have insufficient testosterone and a dr. can correct that for you. Don't put this off.
It is more than sufficient. If the therapist wants some more clarifications, please don't feel shy or hesitant to disclose even if it is a SECRET.
This made my day (:
Idk but I kinda like that☺
A woman can and should do whatever she needs to do to defend herself. If a woman is getting attacked by a man, a lot of self defense techniques focus on the groin because most woman are smaller/weaker than their attacker. The groin helps to level the playing field as most men will double over in pain after a shot to the nuts.
Of course it's fair.
Yes, Use whatever means it takes to protect yourself.
ANYTHING is fair to keep you safe if you are attacked.
that's easy , carbs and sugars.....actually broad spectrum antibiotics did a great job piling unwanted weight on me.....it kills off good bacteria and if you don't counter act it with probiotics. you'll start to swell like a loaf of bread due to the increase of the yeast rising within...I DO NOT RECO THIS, just wanted you to know how farmers fatten cattle, and what happens to those who get broad spectrum antibiotics....it's really a curse....don't do it, you'll regret it fro the rest of your life....but carbs and sugars are the weight gainers tools
I gained purposely by eating ice cream.
mcdonalds
beer , donuts,
I drink more water than anyone I know and I am still consistently dehydrated. It affects my bowel movements and has even lead me to get a mild hemorrhoid. I eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, most of my diet, and I eat whole wheat instead of white processed wheat. The only thing I can think of that may be causing constipation is either my daily banana or my dairy intake. I m not sure what else to think or do. Thanks!! Sorry if this is tmi.
Do you take any medication? There are lots of medications that cause your BM's to be less than desirable. Are you actually dehydrated or are you just thirsty? If you drink a ton of water and feel thirsty still, you may need to be tested for diabetes. The only answer I have is to go see your PCM, they are the only ones who can rule out health issues like this. They will likely prescribe you a stool softener, tell you to drink more water and to increase your electrolytes if they can't find anything wrong. Good luck
Dairy is constipating. Re constant thirst, call your Dr.
It's both the dairy and the banana. Ease up on the bananas, don't have one a day, limit it to two a week... I have the same issue.
If you started the pill on or within a few days of the start of your period your should be protected anyway but note that the pill is never absolutely perfect and its never a bad idea to use condoms or spermicide routinely as a second level of protection if you want to be extra safe.
Yes
Yes. Then you should start being responsible.
Yeah, you need to get your eyes checked. Being able to see things up close clearer than far away means that you are short sighted. Take care :)
Yes it's called myopia, unfortunately it's awful If only the greedy health industry would reveal ways to improve vision -.-
Tbh you should just get your eyesight checked... the same thing happened to me & it turned out that I need glasses... 😗✌
Time for a proper eye exam. Not the school nurse.
I'm 17 next week and i keep worrying as im with a girl and i thinks she wants a sexual relationship. Flaccid I'm 3.1 inches in length. Flaccid I'm 3.4 inches in circumference/girth Erect I'm 4.9 inches in length Erect I'm 3.8 inches in circumference/girth Please let me know if im below average.
Yes that's pretty small especially the girth. No, at 17 it's done. Mine is shorter though and I'm 28.
Well within the normal range. Besides, women won't reject you based on penis size any more that you'd reject them because of the size of their labia. A relationship involves so Much more than a physical measurement.
Flaccid size is adult normal. Unfortunately your penis erect is below adult average of 5.16 inches long and 4.59 inches in girth. So bit on the smaller side but should still do the deed just fine. Might focus on more petite girls.
You're a little below average
It's not about size ever. It's about deep emotional love.
You'll be ight
You think? Lol
It depends on how much you had. A serving is 1 egg and 3 oz of meat. If you stuck to that it is healthy. If not you are over consuming on a daily basis.
If this is a trick question...It couldn't work if you killed the chicken ! ...Is That the question ?...Did You kill the chicken , ? ...then no egg for later on ....Also no egg tomorrow , you knew this before you killed the hen ...You had to realize that on your own. 🐔
Cool
it's not unhealthy and you'll be fine
yes lol
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES SIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR
E
It depends. I only had one symptom with my uterine cancer, a major bleed one night like the worse period on steroids. Ended up calling 911, ER, tests and then surgery found the cancer. The treatment is often worse. I've now done two chemos, have lost appetite, leg pains and tired a lot. But I should end up OK. It just depends on what kind of cancer someone has. I had an aunt with bone cancer and she had a lot of pain
Sometimes Stage 4 on a pain scale of 10 can be an 11 depending on where it is. .
Depends which of the approximately 200 different cancers you have, where it is locatedand what stage it is. In some cases there is severe pain and in others there are no symptoms at all.
It never bothered me at all. I had zero symptoms. Cancer treatment sucks in extremely profound ways, but it keeps you alive, which is the preferred way to be.
my coworker just told me 5 minutes ago, when the pain hits, its about an 8 out of 10
Fuzzy, you are pain medicated up to your eyes.
It sucks.
Seriously ? You have a purpose in life and don't let those negative thoughts get in your thoughts. Try meditating and yoga and get more involved with your inner and outer self it will take you further in life and help you see more clear. Committing suicide is the easy way out and won't solve anything . Trust me we are all batting our own battles and troubles. See a doctor as soon as possible and call or go to emergency ASAP I hope that helps
Many religions believe that killing yourself leads to hell, so unless you want to spend some time with the devil I don't suggest suicide. Also, killing yourself is a terrible idea, because you aren't living for anyone, you're living for yourself, if you're going to commit suicide just cause you've reached the lowest point in your life, you're being extremely weak, everyones lives reaches this point some people take the struggle, others choose the easy way out.
Because you wouldn't still be alive if God didn't think you have a purpose. Also, when you're thinking suicidal thoughts, think about the people who love and care about you ( family, friends etc ) if you killed ur self they wouldn't be able to get over that. They'd think it was their fault bc they couldn't help you through it.
There's someone out there who cares about you. What about your family, your friends. How do you think they're gonna feel knowing you left them behind?
Doesn't matter how many reasons we give you it's up to you to decide to live. Life gets hard sometimes but you just got to keep going because it gets better.
because you might not find a reason to live now doesn't means you will never find one.
don't you want to see what life has in store for you?
life is only given once. do not waste it use it. when you die your dead nothing to do just inside your coffin.
what about all of the people that will miss you when your gone
Troll
Yes it is if she didn't consent but still moaned it's still rape because she didn't consent
it's rape if she says no
Yes.
If she says "No" and sex is forced, it is always rape, regardless of any other factor!
No, its rape if she said no or stop.
ask yo momma
Yes it's weird. I do it all the time. I talk to myself at the grocery store, in my home, at work, in the car. I talk, respond, ask, etc. I am strange and/or quirky. I have no trouble with it and people who know me thinks it's cute. I was really thrilled when cell phones came out because people now presume I am having a phone conversation. I really have quality ME time and I enjoy it.
Maybe you're just more connected with your inner self. That or you have multiple personalities
well it's not weird as i do it all of the time
As long as you hear no one replying in your head, you're okay. No, it's not weird.
Not at all. Some people talk to furniture :D
Do not do this in public, just do it in your head, practice
Bicep curls Hammer curls Upright rows
curls and the variations for biceps and kickbacks, etc for triceps. The size of your resting arm is largely the tricep.
Skull crushers. Kickbacks. And wth did the last guy just say upright rows
What is a "lift up bar"?
One time there was a psychiatric patient that called the police for help. He wanted to go to the hospital because he thought he was hearing voices. When the cops and the psyc nurse got to his home, they discovered he had forgotten he left a pair of earbuds on, and resolved the issue right on the spot. Not very brought, and to make this story even more ridiculous, I totally made this up on the spot as I was typing your answer. ha ha
Lol I really thought I was gonna have sex w/ that teacher. Haha, and when I go to sleep and try to imagine the perfect one, their image is what comes to mind. Their smile, their eyes, haha. Fúck this!
If it is telling you the shopping list, that's okay, if it is telling you to kill everyone in the shop, not good.
i do but its my own, i talk back sometimes!
~~~~ see a therapist ~~~~
No, but also realize that constructive criticism benefits people, while a white lie might prevent them from improving.
It is not bad and often can make a person feel good about themselves. But you could be less concerned and say something more like ' you did a great job but I would like to see more of this next time' the one thing you do not want to do is harshly critique them and their work. So it is fine but don't let them think what they are doing is completely good enough and let them continue that way.
Yes because if someone is doing a poor job in the workplace or any other place. They should know. Forget their feelings, their feelings don't matter.
Oh, you mean like the legions of people employed (and paid for by taxpayers) at the White House just to try to make Moochelle look presentable in the morning?
Nah. If my girlfriend asks me if she looks fat (and she's put on a couple of pounds) you better believe I tell her she looks great!
Since they are white lies they are not racist so keep them coming.
Basically, I'm an 18-year-old female who is currently having a very satisfying sex life with myself, haha. However, since I've started to masturbate, I have always only been using my shower head, and I want to try something new. Basically, I'm wondering whether I should buy myself a vibrator? Is it, you know, any good? I don't wanna buy it and then find out I don't really like it.
The fact the sex toy industry is worth billions maybe suggests a lot of people think a vibrator is worth the money! You say yourself that you want to try something new so if you have the money try a vibrator, there are lots of different types and variations to try out - some will be better than others but it's pretty safe to say most people like vibrators. Just do a little research to figure out what type you want to try, I recommend stores like Good Vibrations. How to Choose a Vibrator - http://www.goodvibes.com/s/content/c/how... Buying Your First Vibrator: A Beginner's Guide - http://www.blogher.com/buying-your-first... Hey Epiphora Reviews (see recent post of buzzy v rumbly) - http://www.heyepiphora.com
Oh, heck yes! Don't spend a lot of money on one. You can go to Amazon and get one of those tubular waterproof (lasts longer, I know!) vibrators for less than $10.
Everyone here are trolls omg. Vibrators are amazingggggg, honestly. They help a lot. Personally I find putting the vibrator at my vaginal opening and leaving it there while stimulating my clit is an amazing and breathe taking combination.
have you try looking for a boyfriend? I think that would work better than a vibrator, but make sure he's not gay.
Oh yea! Amazing you should get one your missing out lol and you can find cheap ones online. Vibrators are better than dildos I think
Go to a store that sells this kind of thing. You can usually hold them and get an idea of what they are like and can ask the knowledgeable staff.
The women I know(including my girlfriend) tell me that it's like being in the clouds. you should try it.
buy a small one to take with you around in your purse like a bullet one then have a vib called Rabbit at home. its all worth it
You sound like a guy. Listen to Lana!
Your penis at 4 inches is perfectly normal in size for your age. No worries about your penis.It will more than likely get bigger too as you still have a few years of growth left.
according to a study 5.08inches (12.9cm) is the average penis size for a 15 year old and according to the same study, 5.71inches (14.5cm) is the adult average so according to that i predict you will get bigger from 4 - 4.63 inches but you never know, it really depends on your tanner stage your size might stop growing, or it might grow an inch or more no way of knowing for sure also your size is under average, but still normal
no its pretty small. im 13 and have a 7 inch penis
You will seven and a half inches when you are 18. Please don't give best answer until your 18th birthday . measure and I promise you I'm right...give me beat answer.. Seven and a half...watch and wait.
You could continue to grow until your in your late teens to early twenties.
You need to see an actual doctor. That sounds like a serious developmental delay and homeopathic remedies probably aren't going to cut it.
Have him checked to see if he can HEAR. Enlarged adenoids can cause hearing problems. Forget the alternative meds. He needs a doctor and a thorough checkup.
Talk with actual doctors. Maybe ur kid doesn't have anything to say
have you taken your child to a doctor for a physical yet
I don't think there's any of that which will work.
If you show up with it they will take it away and put it with your other belongings... your wallet, your shoelaces... but you typically can't keep it. The cord on the ear buds is considered dangerous because you (or another patient) could commit suicide with them. If you try to bite them (doctor/nurse/etc) then you are wrestled to the ground and taken to a gurney where you are strapped down and they take your Ipod anyway. You are definitely NOT the one calling the shots in a psych ward.
answer is typically no specially if you have a camera they are really strict on that, and 2 u might not be trusted with earphones its really hard to get treatment now specially inpatient treatment as most places are over filled with people unfortunately personally i found cbt therapy worked a hell of a lot better than being inpatient as when you get out you are thrown back into norms which is much harder than staying in the norms and having therapy having been inpatient it is terrifying more than anything else and not worth it as nothing changes get advice from a psychologist they are good!
If you're old enough, just ring the doctors office and make an appointment yourself. Or just tell your parents "hey mom, I have lost a lot of weight lately, mind if I see the doctor?"
Just make an appointment and tell them you are worried so you're going for a check up
1. A simple loss of weight need not be a case for so much of worry and mental torture. 2. Tell your beloved mom to take you to a physician in your vicinity.
Doctor's are bottom feeders, you are better off with out the poison they want to shove down your throat.
Perhaps you should discuss this with the school nurse. If she thinks its an issue then you can take it further
Open your lips, and let the words come out
Tell them u already prayed and god did nothing
I assume you're misquoting Richard Dawkins' "one god further" aphorism, which he's used in several speeches and his book _The God Delusion_. For instance, in a TED talk he said, "An atheist is just somebody who feels about Yahweh the way any decent Christian feels about Thor or Baal or the golden calf. As has been said before, we are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further." The number of gods that atheists believe in is zero, so "one god further" is surely directed at Christians and other monotheists. 1 - 1 = 0.
Of course atheism is a belief system. Nobody ever said it wasn't. What it is NOT is a religion, as some idiots claim.
Atheism refers to the absence of gods. Therefore 0 gods.
Your first name fits.
Screw you
no it isn't unhealthy
Nope. Just messy, is all.
No
NEVER fool around with a food allergy. The problem with food allergies is they can go from mild to life-threatening very quickly. So if your mouth hurts when you eat bananas, just stop.
Lots of people eat them and get that mouth thing but aren't allergic. You'd generally get a reaction like hives type thing if you were.
Up to you. It is apparently a mild allergy. If you would rather eat them and have a sore mouth that is your prerogative.
You could have a latex allergy, no I wouldn't eat them anymore. Stay away from avocados too.
you just have to stretch out your mouth gradually, first use a smaller banana, then you use a bigger one, then a bigger one if you wanna put a large c*ck in your mouth, you just have to ease into it; you may wanna try different sized dildos instead
No, you should just not eat them because you are allergic.
sure If you want your mouth to hurt... eat them..... I know that pulling my hair hurts, should I pull my hair??? Must be a liberal.
I have smoked tobacco about 15 times today already and it is only lunch time so I wouldnt stress about it.
It takes time to develop cancer and much more than what you probably smoked. Though if it was tobacco, your chances will increase. If you look up pictures of weed and they match with what you smoked, no worries.
I am up to 30+ cigarettes a day. I wouldn't worry about only one.
Sigh.....pathetic
"Average" or "healthy" ? If you're in USA or UK, the average weight of women there is much higher than the median healthy weight. You can compute your Body Mass Index: it's just your weight divided by the square of your height (in international units). Healthy range is between 20 kg/m2 and 25 kg/m2 (meaning that after 25 the risks of cardiac diseases and so on increase). I think the average for females of all ages in UK is around 26 kg/m2. It's probably even higher in US.
so sound nice and slim. on the low side of normal weight. where you are is good or you could even gain 10 to 20 pounds and still be "normal"
Those are actually the perfect weights for someone around that height.
You are actually a little underweight for your height. Average for your height would be about 120 pounds.
yeah around 111 is normal
Pain isn't usually a sign of breast cancer but it sounds hard to live with. Try a doctor.
My mum has had Breast Cancer and you would feel a painless lump in your breast. That has nothing to do with Breast Cancer.
That's not a sign of breast cancer. Breast cancer is painless.
Pain is rarely associated with early breast cancer. Breast pain is usually hormonal and often associated with growth. If this cannot explain your pain, see a Dr.
Normal
That doesn't sound like cancer. Have you gone to the doctor?
Sorry, has nothing to do with cancer. Not a symptom.
No but it's obviously your hormones at work. Take some ibuprofen or midol.
And what does this have to do with cancer?
It'll just be a random pain. Go take a walk and you'll be fine...
Fruit
one of the most common condition to coincides with high diastolic blood pressure is being over weight.you should try to reduce your weight by doing exercise, eat healthy foods like fruits and vegetables
Less of everything.

If you really want some wonders or miracles to take place you should compulsorily pray at least for two minutes daily. Pray honestly and sincerely with implicit faith, unshakable belief and ardent devotion. Your genuine prayers will never go waste. It will be suitably rewarded soon. If you do so, your friend will LIVE for a long life. Rest assured.
Umm...just relax. I know its a very hard and painful situation for you. Now, plz dont think tooo much about it. Make yourself busy with other things like studying, playing and spending time with family. I understand your situsation. Just stay calm May his/her soul rest in peace
Sorry to hear about your bestfriend :( you should consider bereavement counselling
Tell your parents your thoughts haven't been the same since he died
Not possible. But with the help of makeup, you could try. I have green eyes and purple really makes my eyes pop.
You start by finding a Genie in a lamp who will grant wishes.
Have them tattooed. Doesn't that sound like fun?
You don't. Why the super silly question?

Wait untill u and ur gf is ready cuz sex is painful. It's painful on the girl cuz u r putting the dick in the vagina and it's spraying and u r pushing and hummping so it makes it painful. So always wait
It probably would be best if you get yourself a vibrator and try to burst it yourself rather than wait and let some guy try bursting through.
go to your doctor- they Numb the area and snip it- takes 10-15 minutes in the office- no big deal
if you take your time and don't rush it you'll be fine
Stare at the 4 corners of the wall. Pretend you have telekenesis. Question yourself on why you decided to drink and drive. Debate on whether you should do it again or not. Read a book
Bring a Book. A BIG Book.
Read good books written by famous authors. You will get some fresh ideas.
Name all the other things you should be doing instead of driving drunk.
about 30 000mg are enough to cause liver failure and immense pain, if left untreated you would die in 2 days. I had someone come to me in er that took 50 000mg and came the next day, the amount of pain he had was incredible, we managed to save his life and he got help.
You have to take a whole Lot but It Can Cause Liver Failure
Yes. It will destroy your liver painfully and slowly.
yes
depends on what you take them with
Fell off my bike going down the steepest hill in town going 25 mph. The replacement was lost about 20 years later to a pool cue wielded by a welching sonofabitch who wouldn't pay up.
yes when i was 4 at school i slid on my front on the slide instead of my back and cracked one of my front tooth ever since then I've had lots of appointments and my tooth grew back throughout the years ive recently gotten fillings and had my braces taken off ive now got clear retainers.
i have lost many teeth from being kicked in the face
It was not right for him to do that and he should have stopped when you were in pain. Sex is not meant to be uncomfortable for either person so pain is one things that should mean an immediate "Stop" when having sex.
He is jerk. Classic f*ckboy move. He was only worried about his own pleasure. Sex is two person thing. It is about mutual satisfaction. The moment you said OW, he should have asked what was going on and stopped.
A decent man would stop and ask what is wrong. This guy isn't a decent man. Rethink the relationship. You shouldn't have to demand he stop.
I would never do that to my gf, sex should be the pleasure of two not only for himself. The way he act on you is not acceptable. And you had experience so much pain and you bleed. I want my gf to feel that she need me and i need her, i want to feel her how much i love her not how much i enjoy while she was screaming, i want her to be happy because of me, because i was careful... Because i want her to feel safe while we are as one.
He should have stopped right away to make sure you were o.k. He was only thinking of himself.
I would slow down and make sure everything was okay
How'd you manage to log on and ask this with both your eyes glued closed? That's darn impressive. You can probably get some kind of word with that skill set...
Get to an emergency room immediately, and stop mistaking a little tube for a larger bottle, nobody will believe that you are that stupid more than once.
Ya, right , like that is believable Apparently you did catch a few....lol
Head straight to emergency...
ER. now
I know we all get weak in some way after as it's very draining, but i've never seen it like this before. He doesn't masturbate often so usually his orgasms are with me every 3/4 days, he's very fit and healthy also. So anyways,mon e he was over me when he finished and he just collapsed on me during it and then other times his arms goes limp and he just loses power or something, why is this? He is worried also?
Sounds normal if he is really putting all his effort into the sex. A good round of sex willtypically leave a guy tired a powerful climax will be draining. But most guys should recover in a few minutes.
That is not normal. Normal reaction after ejaculation is relaxation and enjoyment. Not collapse . If he is in good physical shape like you claim, then the only other thing it could be as he has some type of medical condition. He needs to talk to his doctor about that.
It's normal, specially if the orgasm is intense. The male body releases lots of hormones after the orgasm, making the body relax and feel good and sleepy.
no, it is not draining, it's that after climax the brain releases relaxing hormones as bonus, and their effect lasts from 30 to 60 minutes
That is normal male reaction. Endorphins and Prolactin flood his brain to stop him withdrawing too soon to make baby. < M
Apply pressure to the area so the blood flow will stop. Did you knick the head with your fingernail? The penis is full of blood so can bleed easily.
You should go immediately to your doctor just to make sure you do not have a medical issue.
Dont do that again dude, youre hurting yourself dont you know that? Be careful next time bro.
ask your dad to take you to a doctor
Since you're only thirteen, it's likely that your penis will grow at least some. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. So you have a little time left. No worries kid.
Yes it will get bigger over time after puberty it will get bigger I can almost guarantee you. Have you experienced any puberty signs? By the age of 18 it will grow a lot more.
Yes
Go to church and ask God. The only thing is - He doesn't care. You will see. That is so called life... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Yes. As you get taller, you get bigger down there as well.
You are just starting to grow and will continue until your late teens to early twenties.
Sure over the next year.
No. Deal with it.
sure, you very young
Yes, because your hormones are out of whack which can cause these emotional highs and lows.
I think so. I'm not a woman so I can't answer this in full, but your blood has a lot of iron in it, so when you lose all that blood, you're losing iron. This lack of iron in your blood causes the fatigue you are experiencing.
Yeh
Happy Birthday. Hope it was a good celebration. You're at the start of puberty, so be patient and give it a chance. Yes, some boys will be bigger than you down there, but most end up more or less the same once puberty is done.
You got nothing to worry about kid. That's normal size for your age. Mine is 1.5 soft and I'm a hell of a lot older than you are. So be happy with what you have.
Not small for 13. Will be growing rapidly over the next year or so.
Don't worry about it. It'll grow eventually.
When the statement said £7 Dr (Debit) it means that you overdrew your account by £7. Then when you paid in £10 Cr (Credit) that money was used to pay off your overdraft and now you are left with £3 credit. Is this the first time you ever had a bank account in your life?
DR is debit, which can be a bank fee or withdrawal. CR is credit, which can be a deposit or bank credit. If you overdrafted, the 7 is probably an overdraft fee.

Hey I'm also 16 and I'm a boy so I didn't need a thigh gap haha but I felt self conscious so decided to try and lose weight too, the best way is aerobic exercises, if you live near a park try going for jogs bike rides or long walks if possible, and maintain your healthy diet but tbh the biggest part is exercise, I still eat crap but I burn it all off through exercise. Hope this helps :) Also forgot to mention you may need to gain muscle in the thighs to tone your legs, do this by leg weight exercises in the gym if possible.
It is great to have such lofty goals. Eat a bit less Move MORE !
I am 5'10 and weigh 250 lbs. The weird thing is, I see other people who are my size in height who weigh 230 lbs or 250 lbs and look obese. I don't look that fat. I am definitely not skinny but more like chubby. Everybody tells me im not fat looking but I went to the doctor and stood on the scale and it said I weigh 250 and am considered obese. Why do I weigh so much but not look like it?
You may have a lot of muscle, and some people just carry their weight differently than others do. You are one of those people who may always not look as heavy as you actually weigh. Everyone in my family is the same.
Unless you are into body building, 250 lbs at 5ft 10 is an awful lot.
It is because a lot of your fat is being stored in the empty space inside your body instead of closer to the surface.
I'm being serious. We were just in undies and his sperm soaked me and him. And a few times I know I felt his dick go in to me thru his boxers. But I asked everyone if they thought it counted and they just laughed @ me. But his dick really did enter a little and there was sperm all over me anyway..so i feel like it counts but...why do you ppl think? Why shouldn't it count?
In my opinion you're still a virgin :-) But I can imagine that some other people had a good laugh about it. I think the 'rule' for loosing your virginity is a penis going inside, either bare or with a condom. Both two layers of clothing and the top of his penis just getting to between your lips at most does not count. Once you're ready to loose really your virginity you'll know the difference :-)
It is highly unlikely that his penis actually entered your vagina while he was still wearing boxers. His underwear would need to be about 5 sizes too large in order for that to work. The tip of his penis going between your labia doesn't count as losing your virginity, he didn't actually make it to your vagina.
You probably did not lost your vcard, assuming it didnt go inside of your vgina and nothing has been torn, he just ejaculate outside of your undies.
Grow up and stop posting garbage.
When you feel the kicking of tiny feet you will know for sure. < M
You mean a YEAST infection; not an EAST infection! A yeast infection is a common vaginal infection. If you want to know what causes a yeast infection, look up "Yeast Infection" on the internet. It will take about 5 seconds to find it.
Think you mean, yeast in witch case it's also known as thrush, it's a fungus of the vaginal walls. Creamy discharge kind of itchy maybe a little stingy. Easy to treat with a tablet or cream. You can buy it at a pharmacy without seeing a doctor. If the tablet doesn't work and it continues then see you doctor.
it's a yeast infection and it's from not cleaning down there properly
you get an east infection by having sex with an asian
usually picked up in japan
Well either your stupidity lead to your fathers death, or you're a very happy troll.
call 911 why would you let your dad lay there and die
911 you dummy what the hell are you doing on the internet.
YES!
i would wait a couple more days to be sure
and where's your mom?
Wow - juice cleanse - really bad idea. If you want fruit EAT IT..... don't drink it. Fruit is just sugar which is poorly tolerated by your body (inflames your liver!) - but the fiber in fruit mitigates that effect. So DO NOT use fruit juices - they're junk food. And if you do eat some fruit, you'll be pooping a blue streak - like you're supposed to because you'll get the fiber you need. This fruit juice idea is very damaging - and more damaging because so many people think it's "healthy" - it's what the advertising is telling you.
No, because the juice cleanse is a pointless and stupid waste of time.
Nope
Of course not.
Yes, nicotine is a vaso-constrictor, which means that it causes the veins to get smaller, thus increasing blood pressure.
consult with doctor
And how much?
if you got a *****
If i eat fruits for breakfast and salad for lunch a normal meal for dinner . i already work out at the gym 3 to 4 times a week but cant lose the weight . A poor diet i think is my problem .would that do it . Also i just cant drink water for two months . Is diet soda ok ...Thanks for your answer . i now weight 240 lbs at 6-2 . iwant to weight 210 to 215 lbs
See, even if you switched to water and then switched back, you'd gain the weight back. You have to make permanent, sustainable changes to your lifestyle.
Go to weird places. Like the mall and the public bus. Then worry hard there. And look and identify the people. Really soak in how dangerous and lame of a situation you are in. Then compare it every time you are alone and embrace how much better the alone time is. No risk of herpes, assaults, some funky rash because a dirty homeless person rubbed against you. Then start paying attention to all the gangs around you. It's way better in doors.
Sounds like Social Anxiety. Strict environment or possibly guilt-induced or being too nice to others and manifesting as this feeling of perfection/getting a bad name if caught by someone watching over you. It's likely anxiety-based and normal overall.
It happens if your horoscope is weak. It is really unfortunate. It may be only due to some bad luck, bad time or fate. Nothing else. Please don't over think about it now if you are mentally upset. It is a good sentence. If it is in the form of a question, you will get pleanty of best solutions.
I think almost every antidepressant package says that the manufacturers themselves don't know exactly how they work. So, some work for people and some don't. Yes, some can really help. Yes, some can make you worse. So, you need to have open line of communication with whomever is prescribing them. One thing that can be highly effective I'd talk therapy. Getting your emotions or there and having a professional point out things that maybe you have not noticed is very beneficial. Regular exercise is a proven stress reliever too, and beneficial for depression. I hope you feel better soon! (P.S.--Ironically, I take an antidepressant for my migraines. Another case of "not sure why it works, but it does.")
I'll be straight up with you if your a dude taking antidepressants is a guaranteed way to destroy your sex life. Ive been on the majority of anti depressants and every single one robs your sex drive and in the end makes you more depressed. My advice is to keep it simple. Our greatest asset in life is our body. Clean diet with a workout routine is step 1. Step 2 get yourself a hobby I like art or woodworking. Basically do what you want when you want with respect for yourself and those around you. If you live life like that you can't lose.
The right antidepressant(s) will not make you feel numb, they will just help you feel more balanced. But they work best in combination with talk therapy with a good counselor.
hey. i suffer from depression, and i am on an antidepressant called Abilify, It really works and im on 10 mg of it. it doesnt make me feel no emotion either. it ust helps me not have depression episodes. thanks! Samantha. P.S. if you nneed a friend or want to talk more, email me! ducky0805@yahoo.com
Some work and some dont. If 1 type doesnt work then you communicate with a shrink and he or she will determine what to try next based on certain symptoms.
Yes
They didn't help me they made me sick I started smoking weed haven't thought about suicide since last time I attempted it (a few days before I started smoking) it is only a temporary solution tho like all medicine
Do not take pills, JESUS CURED MY DEPRESSION AND HE CAN CURE YOURS PRAY TO HIM AND SEEK HIM
I thought the sprinklers were turning on by themselves so I got out to see what sound was and I saw my dad with a swollen dick peeing normally then he started peeing white stuff and he had to put in a lot of effort in to shaking this mysterious pee off as it was like super glue, then he started shitting his pants and he quickly pulled down his pants a diaper was there and through it away in the bushes. sorry but this all happened so fast.
Should i explain it to you? Well, its a guy thing and its normal for teens and dads to do that, our penis sometimes "swollen" when we feel good so its not a bad thing. We dont literally pee it but when we reach to the point of no return, a "superglue" comes out, its just a liquid like pee and saliva and so thus completely normal... But you can learn alot of it in your biology class, reference book and later a much better stuff. Dont mind it, dad's completely fine.
Well this is the craziest thing I've heard, what in the Devil was going on? Did you run out to him with a towel to clean him up? Sheesh WHAT WAS GOING ON??!!
It's good to see Yahoo still aren't enforcing the age limits on this site. You have to be a big girl to post here kid, come back when you've grown up.
Magnesium & Vitamin D are especially important for mental health. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25713056 "Vitamin D and the omega-3 fatty acids control serotonin synthesis and action, part 2: relevance for ADHD, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240206 "Suicidal patients are deficient in vitamin D, associated with a pro-inflammatory status" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603926 "Low serum concentrations of vitamin B6 and iron are related to panic attack" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18586459 "Inflammation and iron deficiency are two important causes of anemia.

Yes, antipsychotic medications have problems. But they are far, far better than schizophrenia without the antipsychotic medications. Don't kid yourself. Nothing else will control the psychotic symptoms. Exercise will help you with the anxiety so that it doesn't turn into depression.
Electroshock Therapy
There are good meds for these things but if you refuse that type of help, all you can do is put all your problems in God's hands. He still heals people today. Go to healing services, and get prayed for.
use your medication lol its much better than the alternative idk how you have schizophrenia at 13 yrs old and can live without meds.s theyre not horrible and worst case you will feel kinda sea sick. theyre not 'horrible', its 2016 they dont make meds out of powdered mummies anymore just keep trying meds until one works for you. your being christian should have nothing to do with it
Marketing and half truths. But it's not honey that holds the honor anymore. It's agave and coconut sugar syrup.
Everything in moderation. If you're going to use some type of sweetner....might as well be one that tastes so good.
Well it is good for sore throats, healthy or not.
who CARES lol! let people eat what they eat. and in moderation it's fine.
Its up to you to make your kids understand they need to brush their teeth So, get your 10 year old braces like the orthodontist says, and make sure he brushes his teeth good
Get REAL world education about the dentist money making opportunities of Braces. If u got lots of extra money and kid Actually NEED braces go for it. As for 10 yr old not brushing. Simple-- stand behind him as he brushes
Wait... so what is wrong with your older daughter's dental hygiene?
Yes
Sure, helps you relax, get rid of sexual tension and clears the mind by getting rid of the sexual urge for a while.
No , makes sex weak and cause Erectile Dysfunction
pent up sperm is not healthy
Start with pushups on your knees ("girl" pushups). Every other day, do as many as you can, 3 times, with a 2 minute rest between goes. After a couple of weeks, try again with regular pushups. Keep at it until you can do all of your pushups normal.
Start jogging and eating right.
Do them on your knees for a while or up against a wall until finally you can do real ones. Or just keep trying to do them until one day you can. Doing sit ups and crunches, planks and stuff like that can help. It is mostly core and upper body strength.
( Weight Loss Green Store Tea product ) is a wonderful product. I was watching what I eat (Low carbs) and exercising at least 3 times a week but hit a sticking point at 10 pounds down so I decided to try this product....two weeks later I am 16 pounds down!I works fantastic. It taste good and I use it only once a day, it cleans your system out that is for sure.
Then how fast will you gain it all back plus then some... You could lose 10 lbs +, but like any fad diet with quick results, you'll throw your body into mayhem... Then watch out, the munchies and appetite you cant seem to get rid of or satiate, the metabolism you just ruined, and BAM! Your 160 lbs, wondering what went wrong. Do it the smart way. Eat healthy, dont skip meals, exercise and you'll lose the weight slower but it'll stay off.
3-5 pounds a week MAX. DO NOT take diet pills, or fast, or barf, you will do more harm then good to your body. Start with a lemon water cleanse, that will get rid of the bad stuff 2-3 pounds of it stuck inside of you.
Is kind of hard to get an answer because everyone is different and how much time do you dedicate to on it.
You can probably lose about 8 pounds if you work hard at it.
You wont have done any damage and not smoked long enough to be too addicted to it and should find it easier than someone like myself who has smoked for a long time, onl person that can help s yourself, you need strong willpower and determiation, dont waste time or money on the patches, Good Luck
I smoked for 34 years. I quit smoking and started vaping 4 yrs ago
Google how to quit smoking. 1,000 websites will come up on how to stop.
Just make your mind up to stop and stop. That's what I did so I know it can be done.
Not really. Some guys the foreskin pulls back early in puberty, and some guys it is much later. Answerers that say foreskin pulls back at 8 years usually do not have a foreskin. LOL. Rubbish about cleaning there if not able to. You can have sex without retracting much, don't worry about it, it may loosen. You ripped glans pulling back = it will heal, if you Leave it alone it will become less sensitive. < M
You should have been pulling your foreskin back and washing under there with warm soapy water every day since you were a small boy. At your age now if you're not able to, you're going to have a tough time. It's going to be painful and a slow process, but you need to start stretching your foreskin enough to where you can easily pull it back whenever you need to.
These Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pills work well . my husband usually comes home from work and complains that he is too tired for anything . but in the last week these have been helping lot. He wants to have fun every night and is now bugging me to have sex.
Girl's have a pee hole as well. It's just right above the hole where you stick your pecker in.
ask girls to watch them pee. its amazing
By sitting down on the toilet....that's all im going to say lol
Go ask your Mom kid.
From the Asssholee
Probably 2-4 Weeks
About 2 pounds per week is the weight loss recommended by medical professionals. To achieve this, just eliminate processed foods, salt, oil, and animal based products. Substitute whole plant based foods: legumes, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. For specifics, visit the web sites of John McDougall, Joel Fuhrman, or Dean Ornish.
I heard 2 pounds per week is the "healthy" way so thats two and a half months But it all depends on how much of a calorie deficit you can handle
You could lose it in weeks or months. It depends on how much you are exercising, what your diet was like before compared to now, and how much muscle you are gaining versus fat you are losing.
I think he smokes WAY too much weed
I think your pastor is losing parishioners and it's hurting his wallet, so he makes inflammatory remarks against atheists to keep you right where he wants/needs you. Imagine getting paid to go on stage and speak whatever you want and people come to watch you and come forward to be touched by you, and then they pay you. What a gig! Some really believe what they preach, but others are not believers and are in it for the money. Get real! Lies and delusions. Some are liars, and some are delusional. You're going to listen either a nutbag or a liar. ex-xtian
I think he's making an assertion that he has no hope of proving, Theists are good at that. I'm pretty damb sure I know what I believe and what I don't. I'm also pretty sure that he has no freaking idea what I believe and what I dont. That kind of illogical and ignorant assertion is why it's hard to take people like that searously. They have lost all credibility through demonstrating their inability to think for themselves.
Do you deny the God known as Poseidon because you HATE Him, or be cause you have not seen convincing evidence of His existence? Those who want to believe in Poseidon will point to the FACT that He uses His powers to move the tides, EVERY ocean, EVERY day. And, of course, only a FOOL would say in his heart, "there is no Poseidon!" After all, those tides certainly did not EVOLVE the ability to move themselves.
I think he has no clue about atheists or why we don't believe God exists. But ignorance is his choice.
What does this have to do with Atheists? The guy in that video is an Agnostic.
I think "knowing" something to be 100% true is impossible, its all probability, what is most likely. I wish I could debate him
i think he is perpetuation a lie. a lie invented because its so hard to debate against atheists because they are right, so they just claim that they are liars.
I don't hear voices or anything like that before you say anything. I just have a lot of racing thoughts and in result I have full blown conversations with myself. I've always been like this, I've been doing this as long as I could remember. I do this when no one I know outside my family is nearby. I don't even talk to my friends like this. I just want to know if other people do this too so I don't sound like a complete sociopath(I promise you, I'm not. I don't hear voices or have any hallucinations).
Yup. I'm like that
Yes, it's perfectly normal. If you don't hear voices replying to you, then you are okay. ;-)
i do it all of the time
Well, you are either 5 or 6. And you measure several times in a week and use the largest measure. No way to make it grow, 5.16 inches is average adult size anyway.
Depends on how old you are. You really can't do anything to make it bigger besides a penis pump or plastic surgery (which are both very much not worth it). Don't worry about it, I think average is like 5.18 inches anyway.
Is that having a ***** or no *****. How old are you? I would say if it's without a ***** your all set you have a big one and girls love big ones.
You cannot make it grow bigger, only temporarily.
Unfortunately, we can't just disconnect from the world, if you expect to earn a living. We all wish we could be independently wealthy. Maybe you would enjoy travelling. Maybe you can be an exchange student in a foreign country, or do volunteer work in another country? Or did you have in mind to stay in your room studying on-line courses? If you want to disconnect from people, just don't talk to anyone, and wear headphones all day, listening to music. You sound like you need to find a purpose, and something that engages your brain. Ask yourself, what do you enjoy doing?
You could seek out new friends by maybe joining a club or something doing a hobby that you enjoy, then you'll meet people that you have stuff in common with. But I understand that it might be difficult to find the time. About just "disconnecting".. You have no idea how much I think about that (I think everyone does, actually), but in reality it's generally just not feasible.
How long would you disconnect? Taking a day off is fine and many people do this weekly. Maybe your dad can work the money back? Hope it works out!
i totally get you, maybe when you're finished this term or semester go on a trip with some family or old childhood friends that you can trust to not ditch you or anything, or make some new friends they may be cool. going on an exchange or a trip to somewhere like europe or australia is always pretty neat because the culture isn't extremely different from ours but enough that you experience something new. traveling is definitely one of the best things to do for yourself!!
There is even a song about your predicament. It goes, "Where Can I go but to The Lord." Jesus is the answer. I know that sounds simple, but Christ is the answer that you need in your life. Try a good Bible Study group in your area that teaches about Jesus. I am not talking about Catholic church. Read some books that Kay Arthur has written about Jesus. She is a good teacher. With Christ you will never be alone. He has promised never to leave us or forsake us. He will strengthen you and give you confidence.
Do not "disconnect", volunteer and help others, you'll find a purpose helping those less fortunate than you when you do . . .
Who is John Galt?
Peace corps.
You should try dating an older man, like in his 30 or 40s. It will be an awesome adventure for you both!
You don't have to do anything you don't want to do. He can suggest all he wants. Tell him that you don't feel depressed. It is normal for you to feel emotional and be upset about things. Everyone gets that way sometimes. Not everyone needs mental health counseling. Maybe he thinks because it helped him it is the answer for everything.
Actually, a psychiatrist is not all that helpful and they charge a LOT. Depression is common but easy to treat.------ Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it but, after that, you will be a whole, new, calm, happy person.
You have self esteem issues, feel guilt over things you can't control, etc, etc, etc, That's not normal. If you can see a professional about these issues and overcome them, why not do it???
It can't hurt to see what one thinks. If you're fine, then he will stop bothering you about it.
"Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest" (Matthew 11:28, KJV).
Because its his way of saying that your doing an amazing job and that makes you feel horny. As a man, I love to hear a woman moan in bed for the same reasons. Its a win win situation when both partners can make each other moan.
Because it's sexy as hell... at least in a context where he is moaning of pleasure
Because you need Jesus in your life.
Because you like to know you're appreciated.
I'm 15, 5'3 and 104 pounds and I'm wondering if this is a normals day worth of food? tell me if I'm eating too much or too little Breakfast: Bowl of Oatmeal (340 cal) snack: bowl of Greek yogurt with a few pine apple cubes (164 cal) lunch: small bowl of chicken noodle soup with 10 crackers and grapes (219 cal) Dinner: turkey burger patty and asparagus (176 cal) Snack: Turkey wrapped in lettuce with an apple ( 200) In total I had 1,109 calories today
Too little, verging on eating disorder territory. You're already thin, and you need probably 1600-2000 per day to maintain weight. I've heard people say never to go under 1200, even when dieting to lose weight But anyway, don't count calories. Eat when you are hungry until you feel full. Make healthy choices.
You're not eating enough. Teenagers should be getting more like 1800-2000 calories daily, depending upon activity levels. The fact that you track your food intake so compulsively, combined with being underweight and eating so little all raise red flags for a possible eating disorder.

This is possbile, but its very hard. You have to get right posistion and try to write with it alot of times like hours per day. Its like you are footballer and your Left foot gets hurt and you wanna start playing with right, Same story was with me, i was playing football with Right, but now im with Left :8
depends on how right handed you are - some people can write with both hands others not - practice and see
Yes. Practice and repetition are key.
You can train your left hand to write but why would you bother?
both are dangerous for your health but not sleeping is more than not brushing teeth because if you don't take a proper sleep your mental health will not good and you will feel unfresh and tired.brushing is also important because if you don't brush your teeth the germs will come in your body and these germs can make you ill.
Not sleeping.

That's not a question sir
Dont worry Its fine but u r trying it daily or 2-3times a week
All of that is because of your age. Just relax, it will all figure itself out in a few years.
You won't I have done the same... Masterbating is perfectly fine :))
U r doing it too early . Stop it to save u from inefficiency on a girl
Yes. Her stomach is very far away from her vagina.
Nothing BUT pre-*** that you have no control over. I don't care if you didn't feel any, or if you didn't see any. It may or may not have been there and may or may not have had sperm in it. Pulling out is not birth control, it is a game of Russian Roulette.
Some got in her no lie once you start to feel that good sensation it's their better yet every thrust you give her a little bit gets inside of her.
Your pre *** probably got in her and your semen technically could of rolled down her stomach onto her vagina
Some went to her navel.
LOLZ high fivez bro
If your lucky
Where is it coming from? If it's when you wipe after peeing, you're likely having your period. This is absolutely normal and you can expect to bleed every month (though it is normal to skip it have a very irregular cycle when you're young/just starting). If it's blood after pooping, this likely isn't anything serious. It could be from straining or from hemorrhoids. Relax when pooping and make sure you're getting enough fiber. If you have hemorrhoids, you can treat external ones with over the counter products in most cases. Internal ones will need to be checked by a doctor.
It may be Puberty or starting of your periods. Inform your mother about that. She will better help you.
its your period its totally normal for a girl your age. you should go talk to your mum or another female and they can help and explain to you
likely you got your period. When I first got mine, it was pretty much unnoticeable and very light like yours seems to be.
Puberty. Good luck, m8.
You're on your monthly period.
congratulations, you're on your way to become a woman
You have your period.
You got your period.

That is so true. It's pathetic seeing short guys trying to get girls it makes my day seeing them fail and complain
It's nice to know you make a better target than I.
You'll grow up to be a big boy someday!
Pathetic claptrap.
Guessing you're single and still a virgin.
I am sure it is normal. A few of my friends told me that they hate to orgasm; they just fake it. It is not that I hate orgasms it is just that I hate the feeling of it, the loss of control of my body,the build of intensity, I hate the heat of it, the fact that I cannot help but make noise, I hate the fact that everything is to muffled after words like I cannot think straight. The only thing that I like is my bf's smile afterwards. I think that I will just do what my girl friends do...fake it.
nope pretty much nothing you have said is "normal" especially not that you think you are going to **** if you orgasm update if you are convinced it is normal why ask? do your friends also worry that they will poop the bed from an orgasm like you do? because that is not normal either most girls have their first orgasm at a much younger age than you, without ever thinking about worrying about it. and if the vibrator is "too much feeling" why bother with it then? you do not need a vibrator to orgasm
if you've never had an orgasm why not try? if you have and didn't like it(really? lol) then maybe give it a few more tries. when a girl orgasms it's hot. i would get a kick out of it. maybe you don't like *surrendering control* or something. learn to deal with that because that part of it is hot too haha lol if i was your bf id make you c*m anyways. hopefully for me size matters. i think it's more mental with you. what you just described is HOT. idk you should at least consider it.
Try it out on your own. If you pee, you pee. You can learn what you like or don't like, and then try it with your partner. Make sure you are holding it on the right spot. Holding it on your urethra will make you want to pee, and it is right below your clitoris. For women with little labia, the urethra is pretty uncovered.
Guy can be a bit obsessive over this. Just tell him you don't like it and that he needs to stop.
Hit yourself in pelvis with vibration device repeatedly until numb to solve the problem
I haven't had sex for a long time but from what I remember no, nothing significant but obviously a little bodily smell is normal, those areas are not suppose to smell of roses or smell like fresh air. Anything really strong and fishy though then it could be an infection or some people are allergic to semen or it disrupts the ph enough to cause bad smells.
no, not if proper hygiene has been used. washing with correctly ph balanced cleansers should keep this area odor free even after or during sex. odor is a sign if improper cleansing...perhaps someone is using soap instead of the correct ph balanced cleansers because soap can upset the ph balance and cause slight infections which produce order. or they may have a yeast infection which causes odor.
Of course they do!!! Dont know why people beat around the bush about it. A butt is gonna stink like **** if somethings being rammed up it and your vagina is gonna stink like fish after being ejaculated into..its just how it is. You can scrub and wash those areas beforehand, you can even put a pretty pink bow on them...but its all gonna stink either way. Lol
Some people think that pheromones may have something to play with it. Like the woman's vaginas secretes a chemical that helps keep the male "in love" with her. The vagina also produces something called smegma, this can sometimes cause a weird smell or taste. Males are most likely known for "dick cheese" if they are uncircumcised. Smegma is thought weird if women have it but women have more of the smegma than males do. Probably because you have more surface area. So if males spent as much time cleaning under their foreskin then they wouldn't have as strong of a scent but it's still there with both genders.
Of course. That area just generates odors.
Just the normal scent. Some boys luv (and are turned on) by that woman's scent. Try to do anal in the shower (together) if u can. Other than that, yeah some odor is expected and perfectly normal.
The combination of lubricant, both natural and store bought, along with vaginal fluids, seminal fluids and the santorum from your anus WILL cause a scent. You have a scent, your partner has a scent and unless you want to offend them I would never, ever, ever, say anything about it. Except to playfully suggest an accompanied pre or post coital shower.
ummm.....sorry to those who answered yes but the answer is HELL TO THE NO!!! There is no reason anything should be stinking with the proper hygiene. Yes the cha cha gets a little sweaty in the summer but who in the hell hops in bed to knock boots unless they freshen up? And why would your azz be stinking anyway unless you didn't wipe and wash it? Same goes for men. If they drop their drawers and their azz smells like shut or their balls smell like cheese than the deal is off. Seeya!
of course not
no it won't
No.
NO
There is none.

It's called blushing, and it's a normal reaction of your nervous system. If you have a light complexion, that may make it more noticeable. If you don't like your blush, though, the solution is simply psychological. When you're talking with someone, be more engaged. We all have social situations to deal with, as we're social animals, after all. Expect them and be prepared for them, and you'll find yourself more confident.
It could simply be that your mood changes; you could be nervous or excited for example. Many times you don't realise this but emotions dk their own thang

I was sleeping and I was dreaming I was in the bathroom doing my buisness but then I woke up and I was really wetting my bed. I got up right away and went to the bathroom to clean myself. I feel so embarassed about this... could it be related to yesterday s work? I worked since 8 am til 5 pm. I couldn t stop crying of shame this morning. I feel like a loser
It happens dude. Change your bedding, wash your clothes and get on with life. If it helps, stop drinking liquids 1-2 hours before you go to bed and make sure you use the bathroom before too.
One make sure pee before you go to bed. Two It can happen once in a while. It happened a week ago to me All i did and cleaned it up and went on with life.
Some times it happens. Do not worry. Clean the mess any way . Next time onwards remember to go to the toilet before going to sleep. Regards.
Did you pee or had a wet dream? Make yourself clear. If you peed (which is most likely) if it repeats see a doc.
I remember my past days, it happens normally. Yay, i was so embarrased that day but it is what it is. Pee before going to bed since you have little control on your pee reservoir.
Embarrassment is worrying about what other people think of you, when it's none of your business. When you really understand that, you become much freer.
It happens, Drink less and pee before bed.

Depression always has a very large physical component to the underlying causes. And that's something that can be changed. Dietary modifications alone can make a big difference in the way you feel. But you have to dedicate yourself to finding out about this subject, making changes, and sticking with it until you find out what works for you. You could start by doing a search in Amazon or on Google on "depression and diet". Don't take anything as gospel--find out what works in your own case. Finding a good naturopathic doctor would be even better.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Just do something that you love, maybe like warm up your blanket eat ice cream, watch a funny movie, maybe start up a YouTube channel and focus on popularity you get and soon your will for get about everything and you will feel calm, and relaxed. Don't go to a psychiatrist because it is stupid and won't work. See a doctor for medication I hope you feel better bro please don't kill your-self think of all the things you wont get to do, see, feel, love, experience.

A lot of cops and feds are probably conservative! Look at the revenues that will be lost if pot becomes legal in all 50 states; A friend was busted with 2 joints. He had $250 dollars on him at the time. The cash was confiscated as drug money. He ended up with a $1,000 fine, A year of probation plus court ordered drug rehab. All together it cost him almost $3500!
Because those drug lords are some shady *** dudes, man. Also, hard drugs are harmful to the user and those around them. Most consider weed ok. Those that don't, don't because they fear a slippery slope type of legislation on the legality of stronger drugs. Just my experience, though.
Why did your mom support the war on education when she raised an ignorant faggt?
Not really. Depression, as the disease, can come in various forms. Some get sad all day, have no energy and so on. Someone get constantly annoyed and can't seem to calm down. In periods you can have good days too. Some days can get so bad that you want to die, other days can be okay. It depends on how affected you are. I've been chronically depressed for the last 10 years and a lot of my days can be "bad", yes, but some are good, and I constantly work on trying to stay in the good periods.
I'm dumbfounded by the amount of ignorance professed by my fellow answerers. (Not referring to finwie.) It depends on what YOU mean by 'depressed'. I'm depressed because my body and poor health are keeping me from going out to the zoo with family. This is justifiable, yet still I am depressed. I probably won't be by bed time, so this is normal depression. Clinically depressed people, often referred to as suffering from Depression, can have the perfect life; money, sex and power, yet still remain incapable of ever truly enjoying anything. They have decent days and horrible days. Never 'normal'.
No, not necessarily. People who are depressed, both with diagnosed and undiagnosed illnesses, tend to have good days and bad days. Some will surrender to bed and medication while others will try to have a good day in spite of circumstances
yes and then some. but soemtiems we get good days. certain types of depresion are worse then others. bipolar is considered the worst the lows are like u watched ur bestie/wife get killed but its on rewind over an over all day . then u get a boost liek ur on the coolest rollercoaster all day . but usually episodes last weks or months not days. mine is weird. others it cna be not too bad but they wouldnt be diagnosed if it wasnt at least bad day bad
I am a 14 year old, 5" 4, 97 lbs/ 44kg, and I want to know how I can get ripped. I would like a really well defined chest/abs/shoulders and I want to know what routine I should use. I already have some definition but I want alot more. I eat pretty well compared to kids my age but what food diet and exercise routine should I use? Diet wise I can t eat any nuts as I have an allergy. Thanks in advance!
At that age your metabolism should be through the roof so eating well won't have a major different but it won't hurt. The main thing you can do it bodyweight exercises. They'll get you toned. Push-ups, pullups, squats, etc. if you wanna get bigger, well then you better hit the gym. Cardio like swimming and running will help too. Swimming especially for shoulders
Dude your underweight. I guess just do a lot of body weight exercises (lifting, fitness blender has a lot of that).
There are certainly meds that help with ADHD and seem to have few if any side effects. You could also work with a therapist who will teach you techniques to better manage your symptoms.
You can go to the doctor and they can prescribe you ADHD medication.
Talk to your doctor and ask him that
No, it isn't. You actually need at least 2000 calories a day; it's especially important that you take care of yourself while your mind and body are still developing. Being malnourished can weaken your immune system and can lead to conditions such as heart problems and osteoporosis. You don't need to worry about eating too much at all-rather, you're underfed! It's admirable to be healthy, but you have to do it in moderation!
No, it isn't. Don't bother trying to count calories. It's impossible to do accurately, and it's a bad idea in general. You need nourishment. You need nutrients. Eat lots of food that has stuff you need, and only small amounts of garbage.
No, it is not a lot. It is not nearly enough. You need about 2000 calories a day.
No. It's not enough for health. Teens need 1500 calories a day to retain muscle mass, which is highly desirable because muscle that's not doing anything still burns calories by existing. (Fat doesn't.) So you want to keep all the muscle you can by making sure you eat enough calories that your body doesn't need to draw on muscle to meet its physical needs.
No. Most people consume 2000 cals or more in a day
Not at all. It's probably not enough.
no you need double that
Say someone got high for the first time last night. They smoked a lot and got hella high, They Were Tripping out Hella, Is it possible for later the next day for them to be tripping out too? I Was High And tripping out a lot, and the next day at like 6 i Was Still Tripping Hella, Like Everything was Fake Is this Normal ?
High on what? Marijuana usually only lasts a few hours. If you did a massive amount it could last a day or more (usually this only happens with pot brownie accidents). You said you were tripping so if it was hallucinogens it could very well have lasted much longer than a day. If it was an opiate, same thing, could have lasted 1-2 days depending on what it was and the dosage. Same with amphetamines and cocaine.
Generally you'll come completely down after like 3-4 hours. You don't trip when you smoke weed, unless it's laced with some other drug. You just feel euphoric, tingly, numb, etc. Weed doesn't have hallucinogens. It's also not very common to get super high the first time you try it.
I don't think this belongs in Home and Garden. Why don't you go to Health? That's a question that would need a medical-type answer.
You should be pulling it back (ALL the way) everyday to clean it so that skin also gets stretched at the same. For now pull it back until it's a slightly uncomfortable stretch (not hurtful) and hold for 10 seconds then relax the skin back slowly. Do this 4 times while in the shower. Soon you will notice it's easier and less uncomfortable to pull your foreskin back. When it becomes less uncomfortable to pull the foreskin back all the way I would suggest to do the stretches twice a day- once in the morning shower and once at night when you are washing everything up before bed.
Your foreskin was supposed to be fully retracted for sex, just as it needs to be daily for cleaning. Once your erection subsides you should be able to easily push the foreskin back onto the glans. If you cannot fully, freely and painlessly retract your foreskin whether flaccid or erect then you must see a doctor as the condition will not cure itself and requires medical assistance to cure the errant foreskin. You may, however, wish to consider getting circumcised so that you don't have a foreskin to cause problems.
It just needs to be stretched more. I am assuming that you pull your foreskin back everyday and washing under there with warm soapy water, correct? As long as you're doing that just use your fingers to stretch out the foreskin a little bit while you're taking a warm shower or in a warm bath tub. This helps stretch it out.
ok
For sure an infection of sorts. Go to a doctor and keep yourself hydrated, it could be anywhere from a UTI to a Yeast Infection. Depending on your sexual activity within the recent weeks, it is possible that you were given a transmitted disease as well. Don't jump to conclusions without going to see a physician first.
Likely a yeast infection. Get some cream or other treatment from the drug store.
Some kind of infection......see a medical doctor.
that you don;t clean yourself properly? have you had unprotected sex? maybe an STD
You have the STD
Sure, just as good if not better, especially for the/a knee situation,because of the lowered impact, you're able to get an equal workout for both legs, toning and cardio plus I find it good for lowering high blood pressure. So to answer your question, "Yes"
Yes, it is very good for those purposes, but not as good as running. Running is a weight bearing exercise, so you get more benefits. But the cycling is good. You have to make sure you are biking at a good level of intensity and for long enough.
It can, & it can be better if you have a not-so-good-knee.....
Go to doc. It could be a yeast infection, an allergic reaction to a new soap or new article of clothing. It could be lichens which can be helped with clobetosol cream.
If it's on the inside of the vagina then it's probably a yeast infection. They can be treated with over the counter remedies available at a pharmacy.
It could be either a yeast infection or urinary tract infection. These are very common, Everyone gets them. Swing by your doctor for a check up.
Maybe the condom your guy used the last time irritated you or maybe he was too rough, that thing is not a piece of hide that needs tanning.

I'm 15 and have a horrible sleeping habit on school nights. I get 8-10 hours on the weekends most of the time but get only 6-7 hours on weekdays. I'm 5'8'-5'9' if that helps anything and just started getting armpit hair and a mustache so I'm not through puberty completely yet. Thank you!
More growth hormone is released during sleep than while awake. During puberty it can make a difference in your growth only if you are consistently deprived of a normal amount of sleep over a long period of time. If you have a few nights a week where you can't sleep well it will have little effect on your growth.
No, growth will happen no matter what-- only extreme malnourishment or severe chronic illness can usually stunt growth. An dmalnourishment is less than 500 calories a day-- a coke, hershey bar and bag of chips is that much.
No, you will not stunt your growth. Lack of sleep causes other health problems, but it is not likely to stunt your growth, since you are getting sleep consistently.
Yes, of course. But what you described is not a terrible lack of sleep. It's not ideal, but you are getting a fair amount of sleep.
Sleep has noting to do with growth... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
No. No effect at all. But you've nearly stopped or you have stopped now. Nothing you can do now.
Yes.
Throw it away. If you really want to sharpen it, I would suggest to just throw it away and get another one. It's really hard to sharpen it, and its not worth the effort to sharpen it.
I don't think you can. just try a diff blade
buy a blade sharpener...if there's such thing

so you there's this 30 day squat challenge and I decided to give it a go for fun plus am an complete idiot for trying it because am flipping 13 and yes am immature. so I did it for 3 days and it about 120 squats a day or so don't know how many. Now my thighs a re really sore I did some stretching on my thighs but still its painful, its more painful when I put force on it either than that its fine while am standing and sitting crossed legged. the worst thing is I cannot walk up or down the stairs! thank you,
Yea the pain is caused by lactic acid. You can take some stuff to help reduce the pain. But know that this soreness is perfectly normal. Your body is not used to extremely exercise so you are bound to feel sore. It will go away on it's own after a couple of days. You just gotta give it time. Don't let this scare you into never squaring again. Just go slow next time and drink protein to help your muscles.
you legs are weak . if u want strong legs . do squat normal 2 times in a weak with 8 setsx12 reps. drink water between sets and strech thighs too between 4 sets for 2 months u will notice the diffrence then go for any squats challenge .. dont go to hard it might tear your thigh muscle. and u might get strech marks on thighs
Dt Trump actually cares about terrorism first of all and second of all I don't trust her policies regarding Isis Russia or China people say Trump would take us to War I think quite the opposite. Hillary is a corporate shill who plays on big money. I think Hillary would take us straight down the path to hell
Lord Trump. Hillary is a witch who lures kids to her gingerbread house and eats them.
Enabler? You think she wanted bill to cheat? You guys are pathetic trying to blame her for what the MAN did. Trump is a nazi wannabe. He is far more dangerous than anyone running.
Donald Trump appears to be certifiably insane. marriage relation is a PRIVATE issue What do you think would happen if the donald decided to "nuke" somebody if he got insulted?
Hillary is a big fat dumb stupid idiot and nobody would be safe other than China Russia and Iran

Neither. Fact is, children are already pretty safe.
Either one.. The POUTS does not keep an eye on every child.
Neither one.

So recently I went to the doctors because I noticed blood in my stool. I'm 16 but I'm still worried about the possibility of colon cancer. I had a rectal examination done and they said there were no lump inside the rectum and no bleeding. However they did say that they spotted a pile. I had to do a stool sample so the hospital can look for blood, it came back normal and no action was to be needed. I then went for a blood test Tuesday and that also came back normal. So does this rule out cancer and can I stop worrying about it?
A stool sample is a pretty good screen for bowel cancer. In the uk, anyone over 50 gets asked to do a stool sample to screen for early signs of stool cancer. If ur blood test also came back normal, then I'd say u should feel reassured That u do not have cancer.
You can stop worrying about cancer. You need to focus on your diet. Piles (hemorrhoids) happen usually because you are constipated. So you need to work on that. 1/4 of your diet should be whole grains (no white flour), 1/2 for fruit and veggies. Drink half a cup of water, at least, per hour awake. No sugar, no white rice, reduce red meat, fried foods, cheese. They all increase constipation. If you are worried about your health, start eating healthy.
You can stop worrying about it - you don't have colon cancer. You've had a rectal exam and two blood work-ups, and they've all been negative for cancer. The doctor did say you had "piles" That means you've got plain old internal hemorrhoids, that's all.
You're completely, insanely crazy to be worrying about colon cancer in the first place!!!!!! You know nothing about it, blood 1 time doesn't mean cancer! This is all your imagination.
Yes. Rule out colon cancer. It is very rare for a teenager and you have no symptoms. You do not have blood IN your stool you had blood ON your stool, which is quite different and quite common with a pile/hemorrhoid.
It shows you have pies and nothing else so stop stressing
Sorry I don't know much about your problem, and you're probably better off seeing/talking to a doctor (pretty sure none of us here on Yahoo Answers can help you). But, my comment/question is, ... how are you a university student and able to regularly get 10 - 14 hours of sleep a night?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??! I'm a high school senior and sleep for like 5 hours a night on average. God dang mate.
that's not good you need to see a doctor oversleeping is a risk of your health my doctor told me when I used to oversleep. they give really good advice.
sounds very much like thyroid. see an hio method chiropractor.
I got stupidly drunk a few nights back and bought a guy back. I presume we had sex but I was so bad I don't remember. Next day he had gone, and no trace of a condom, so I'm guessing it was unprotected. I'm on the pill so not worried about pregnancy, but what are the chances that a) the guy is positive and b) has transmitted it. Weirdly I was due on my period, had started when I woke up, stopped later that day and restarted the next day. Is this linked? I already know what I did was stupid and won't be doing it again
If you actually had sex then there's always a chance, specially if he's positive. But you would have to wait for about 3 months after your possible exposure to get tested for HIV. My period does the same, near the end of it's cycle it stops for a day then restarts with lighter bleeding. So they're probably not related, but if this isn't normal for you then you may want to get that checked out. At least get tested for stds, also talk to your doctor about what happened ask the about being tested for HIV.
The odds are INFINITELY higher than NOT having unsafe sex. There are no odds. STDs are rampant, even more so with people who ride bareback. You don't feel stupid yet, but you will if you find out that you have HIV or AIDS.
Before getting tested for HIV, you have to wait at least 3 months, to allow antibodies to develop if you have contracted the virus, as the test does not detect the virus itself. Ask the guy about his STD status, and make sure to get yourself tested.

When I began to convulse, he stood and watched like he was enjoying it. I could have easily been left several more minutes bagged up. I think the next person he meets with for "bondage play", may end up losing their life. The man also put black women's stockings on my feet after binding my hands, blindfolding and gagging me. This is extremely embarrassing but when I woke up, the stockings on my feet were soaking wet. He had ejaculated all over the bottoms of my feet while I was unconscious.
Sounds awesome. I have some Marriott rewards points saved up if you want to get a room. You probably aren't brain damaged, but I couldn't tell you how close to dying you were without knowing how big the bag was and several other factors to consider. I think you should send me the video so I can give you an accurate answer.
If you were uncomfortable with it, then you shouldn't continue meeting this guy. 6 minutes is pretty ridiculous, and I have no doubt you sustained brain damage. That's really scary, considering your brain cells start dying after 2 minutes of being deprived of oxygen. My recommendation is that you stop your contact with this person, because having that kind of sadism borders on the edge of homicidal behavior. Good luck.
It sounds like you have come across a very dangerous sexual sadist. He was aroused at the fact that he was in complete control over you. The idea of your brain being damaged while he watched was exciting to him. I hate to say it. But you almost certainly have some amount of brain damage.
He could have killed you, you know......Looks like he was a little TOO Into Bondage and he is quite sick for sending you a video to watch yourself go unconscious. Be careful who you associate with. There are a lot of CREEPY People out there.
I am MUCH more worreid about why spmeone would even ALLOW this kind of "play". CALL THE POLICE AND SHOW THEM THE VIDEO. He IS guilty of Attempted Murder -- a felony
EXTREMELY close to death - yes - you could have brain damage
No need to take out the fact that you have AIDS on all people that don't smell of tunah. AIDs isn't awesome but if that's how you accept it then that's fine by me.
To prevent HIV/AIDS people should use condoms and get informed about it instead of coming to irrational conclusions like that. My boy friend is circumcised and he does't have HIV. AIDS is not good, it can kill you.
circumcision has no effect on the transmition of the Aids virus.
I was with a guy who's penis was 3.5 hard. It was not enjoyable whatsoever. Normally, guys like them are good at oral, or something else to make up for their small penis size. He was so sloppy at giving me oral, and the sex was awful too, I never knew if he'd put it in or not because of how small it was. (This relationship didn't last very long. Not because of his small penis, but because I couldn't get the pleasure that I wanted)
The performance is what girls need but if you want your penis big I read somewhere that exercise like running or having sex a lot make penis big because there is muscles inside. I don't know if it true but the article was real so give it a try for one year and see ☺
Your penis is NOT "small". Five inches to 5-3/4 inches in length is the average length of an erect adult penis. Almost NO man has a penis longer than 6 inches. If they tell you they do, they are probably lying to you.
Mines 8 and most women say it hurts. Just relax, you're fine
I am 5 inches erect, and never heard any complaints. In fact I have been told I'm the worlds best lover. So it's all in your head (brain).
5 inches isn't that tiny. Mine tbh is only 4 inches and I have been turned down because of it!
Guys with small penises often make up for it by being experts a giving a girl oral. They seem to like it better than sex anyways.
You have an eating disorder. I guess you kind of assumed that. You need to see a therapist. It sounds like you have a mix of both anorexia and bulimia. Both of these disorders, untreated, will have dangerous effects on your health, and can kill you. Go see a therapist.
The only way to stop binge-ing is to stop starving yourself.
Same here ! It's a blessing and a curse at the same time
If as you said the only sex you have had was oral, then it's probably a heat rash unless you just shaved your penis? or possibly too energetic masturbation? Or whoever washes your underwear has recently changed the washing poweder/liquid and you are allergic? ask if they can be washed in a non bio liquid or powder for sensitive skin. Shower daily, and put fresh underwear on daily as well.Try application of some hydrocortisone cream from a drug store /chemist uk to the painful part of your penis and lay off the masturbation for a while. See a dr if doesn't clear up in a week.
Nobody cares.
STD, STI, OH **** ***** YOU SHOULDA THOUGHT BEFORE U **** NIGGYYYYY
This link provides several counseling options to choose from - http://bfy.tw/2dzq I would schedule an appointment with your primary care doctor. Show them what you have written here and use that as a basis for having a frank discussion on how you are doing. They can do a full physical and neurological workup to rule out medical issues that may be causing or contributing to how you are feeling. They can refer you to a mental health professional that can evaluate your mental state. Once the test results are in, treatment options can be discussed.
Good sentences like this deserve quick response. For quick digestion, you should take it with a pinch of salt and pepper in warm water.
Let it bleed my friend
Your blood is bleeding,,, Is your troll trolling,
Take it to the vet. You're talking about your blood hound, am I right?
Put pressure on wound.
Kill yourself.
If the headache goes away after a while, you do NOT have a brain tumor or brain cancer. A patient who has a brain cancer does not usually have headaches until months after diagnosis, when the cancer becomes terminal and the patient is within weeks of death.
Go to the doctor. However a headache is MUCH more likely than brain cancer.
You get a diagnosis from a doctor. Cancer would be one of the least likely causes for a headache.
There are more options than just the two. To diagnose cancer, you must have a tumor biopsied. If you had a headache from cancer, it wouldn't end.
99% of the time it is just a regular headache, but if you are so worried, which is fear of the answer, then go get a check up from the doctor. Fear, alone, causes more illnesses than a mere headache ever did cause. Why do you fear? Fear is a sin that causes curses. Do you know Jesus? "Perfect love casts out fear, because fear has torment..." Jesus is perfect love. Any hypochondriac that I've ever known needed Jesus in their lives to squash the fear.
This question is total imagination. Brain cancers, tumors always have other symptoms of vision problems, balance problems, etc. If all you have is a headache, then it's just a headache.
just a headache? then it's probably just a headache, probably through deydration. if you have things like Blurry vision in one or both eyes (and dont need glasses), seizures/fits, fainting, blackouts etc, then you might suspect a brain tumor. if your always getting head aches you might be suffering from Migraines.
A regular headache will go away.

Yes if the workout you do is good and fast and makes you sweat BUT ONLY if you eat well and cut back on the junk and fatty foods. You can't lose fat in one spot of your body, you lose fat in all your body including your belly, how to burn fat is to spend more energy than you take in, which would keep your body in negative balance and it will use the stored lipids in the adipose tissue you have. Such a thing would require low calorie intake (good nutrition) and high calorie utilization (a good, sweaty workout). Greetings :)
not if you chill only if you run fast and sweat try running really fast for 1 minute or 2 then walk repeat this then you will lose belly fat
Great product I have been using weight loss gren store tea for 2 weeks and notice a large reduction in my appetite. I would recommend this to anyone serious about appetite suppression.
If you run. Running works your core which will tone up the belly.
yes
They have invested over 50 years into LBJ's 200 year dream. 150 to go!
It's part of their mental disorder. This is why they blame their own hatred and racism on others because its projection. And they don't want to take responsibility for it.
White guilt
*yawn* Still sitting at the kiddie table, eh? When you're capable of having a real discussion, let us know.
They aren't.
Sounds like a lie to me!
Many people think libs are mentally ill.
Here is your typical Conservative upbringing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9w8I2bfCm4c
because you said so
Verify your weight with a balance-beam scale for an accurate result. The high 200s are close to the top range of an ordinary bathroom scale, some of which aren't all that accurate to start with. It's possible that some of your weight gain could be water weight. Have you been eating more salty food lately? I hope you are under the care of a physician experienced in weight loss issues. Not all doctors are experts in this area.
Download an app to track your food intake. Set a caloric goal and stick to it. Weigh in each day (same time, same clothes, etc.), but average your daily weights at the end of each week to see if you're gain, losing, or holding steady. If you're still gaining, reduce your daily caloric goal by 100-200 and repeat the process. If you're losing weight, you're on the right track. Your weight can swing wildly from one day to the next due to bowel movements, water retention, etc. Get daily a weight and average them each week to help you more accurately track your long-term weight changes.
Unexplained or unexpected weight gain or loss is a warning sign that something isn't right with your body. Among other things, it can be a sign that you have cancer, so I would strongly recommend that you make an appointment to see your doctor for cancer screening ASAP. Don't wait. Delaying only increases the likelyhood that whatever is found will be severe and hard to treat.
Avoid all baked goods and full fat cheese. Cook fresh foods. Increase fiber and water so you can stop gaining immediately. When hungry, have an apple, but nothing outside the home. Matter, fat, isn't created from nothing.
From past experience you are still eating more than you are burning up so have a look at exactly what you are eating and make sure you do enough exercise each day, I done it and lost 28lbs, Good Luck
Try the military diet. It's REALLY hard but I lost 10 pounds in 3 days. Just go to google and type in "The Military Diet" Good luck! 😘😘
You clearly eat too much. Sorry, but that seems obvious. You need to make serious changes to how and what you eat.
Jeff gave you false information. Your size is in the normal range for men. And boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16. So you are there.
No, not normal since it is a full 1.4 inches above adult average, but should be done growing in length- may be growing in girth. In top 10% of all men, Be proud.
My puberty teacher told me it would be growing until you'd become 21 years old, same with my doctor, 21.
normal -- nope it has stopped
What a teeny weenie!
Islamic terrorists were responsable for 9/11.
So here's your simple rebuttal. US governments have shown for decades that they will intervene when and where it suits them. The last thing they need to do to justify any foreign policy is kill 3000 of their own citizens.
Error.
Someone wasn't watching
They didn't. Why is it the less intelligent a person is the more likely they are to mindlessly accept simple-minded youtube videos?
They didn't. Why do you keep inventing strawmen?
By adding oil, you are adding fat and calories to the sweet potato's. Remember, all forms of oil are fats, just some are not as harmful as others. Olive Oil is among the least harmful fats. Yes, if you cook the sweet potato's in olive oil, it will make them crispy, but it will also add the peppery flavor of olive oil itself. Canola oil is one of the least harmful fats, and it will not change the flavor of the sweet potato.
Olive oil is fine.
My favorite to use is canola oil, it has been great with nearly everything I've used it for, olive oil tends to be pretty fatty. Hope this helps :)
People tend to think "healthy fats" when they hear olive oil but either way fat is fat.
Olive Oil will not make them healthier. Vegetable oil contains unsaturated fat and that has lots of calories.
Probably just how you were sitting or laying-- and they cramped up.
Maybe you're not doing it right. LOL. Probably just a muscle cramp. It happens.
If you're like me, then you position your footing in an awkward state as you're too focused on doing the actual act itself.
Sounds like constipation if you are only emptying your bowel once a week. There is sometimes a residual sensation in your bowel after a particularly large or firm movement. Try increasing your fibre and drinking more water.
you probably have a horrible diet. there is a risk of colon cancer when you get older if you don't get your system functioning properly. Also, hard stools are very harsh on the sphincter and can cause tearing and bleeding. Try eating some raisin bran for breakfast every day. Eat more fruit too.
No. But it does sound like IBS. Speak to your doctor. There are many digestive disorders you can have. Cancer is far out of your reach.
You should be going every day. You are eating the wrong stuff. It's not cancer.
Your immediate jumping to cancer is ridiculous and shows how ignorant you are, kid.
Bowel is not a verb...
no lol
Hi, I'm 13 and 92 lbs and about 5'4". My mom had growing problems when she was a child so she didn't grow to her genetic potential of about 5'6" or 5'7", so she's 5'3". Not sure about my dads height actually. He's quite tall though. My grandparents are medium to tall. I haven't started menstruation or had my peak growth spurt yet so how much more do you think I can grow? No negative comments please. What things can I do to grow more? I cycle all the time and drink lots of milk if that helps ,
Yeah you can! My parents are about the same and when I was your age I was 5'3. Then I hit my growth spurt and when I was 14 I was 5'7" and now I'm 15 and 5'10"! Since u haven't started your period, there's def and oppurtuntity for more growth
Not really. I'm a late bloomer so I will finish growing when I'm like 16 or so
You are average adult height now so you may be quite tall when grown...BUT your tallness now could be because a girl's biggest growth spurt is often just BEFORE her first period. In most probability you will be around 5ft 6.
So I think I may have porn induced ED. I've head that in order to cure this you have to give up porn and masturbating for at least 4-8 weeks. I think I can do that. But giving up masturbating would be much more difficult for me. Usually if I go more than one day without it I get ridiculously horny and it ruins my social ability. Can I slowly reduce my frequency of masturbating, or do I have to stop completely? Can I just masturbate without watching porn?
When one see porn , weak fluid comes out which cause Erectile Dysfunction. Better avoid to save ur sex power
Works very well !! No side effects , such as headaches other users complain about. Would recommend and have reordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product again.
I'm a bit appalled at the people answering here.... I though we had gotten past the "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" technique of treating mental illness.... Pay them no attention. In the UK, medical care is free... there are dozens of medications that are used to easily treat anxiety. I guess I do understand their attitude since it does seem as though you are using anxiety as an excuse but not doing anything about it.... from that viewpoint you do need to take action to better your situation... simply "sucking it up" is not likely to work though... Go see your doctor about getting treatment for the anxiety. Not sure why you never did before....
Time to put your big boy pants on and get a part time job You need to be looking at Apprenticeships to learn a trade. I suggest you phone the charity MIND for some help. There are support groups in all areas. You don't seem to be doing anything to help yourself. UK
Firstly, speak to your Dr for help in managing your anxiety and also put your name down on the waiting list for CBT. As for money you may be able to, because of your anxiety and because your not in full time education, claim Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). You would need to speak to the benefits about this.
i'm in this exact position): im scared of everything my family is already poor and i'm scared that when they realize i'm doing nothing to benefit them they're going to kick me out also fun fact when i told my dad i wanted to die he said he'd help me out and then called me a lazy *****
I can't tell that you're addicted or not if you don't give us the details about how often you think about it and how often are you doing it. If you're doing it many times a day for a long period of time already then it could be an addiction which wont stay there forever. I've been through the time when i felt i was addicted and was doing it a lot in my early and mid teen years but it eventually faded away and not i do it 4-6 times a week which is pretty normal.
Well its not so much addicted as its a bodily function. Its no more an addiction than your being addicted to say peeing.
every man is addicted
Sure some guys do it to excess, but the average guy ejaculates at least once daily when a teen.
yep
you're obviously pissed at the fact that you were born with the ability to see
Go to anger management
Get you a punching bag.
No your stupid.
is there a reason your mom can't have a key to the lock? you have the lock to keep everyone out but not her, right? so ask for a lock with a key and give her a key. as far as the smiling and looking someone in the eyes. you will need to learn to do that. Whomever it was that told you that you were inviting someone by doing that was/is a ba5tard. even if someone dresses like a prostitute it doesn't give someone the right to take what they want. Live your life for you. No one else.
I have a difficult time believing that this story is true. Go to family therapy with your mom, if need be.
Do you think vertigo can be some type of spiritual creepo screwing around with the inside of your head and eyes
the two can be related, as both are often from circulation problems in the head.
Not that I know of
No it does not in any way.
no it can't
It will actually make you gain weight unless you shred it off the next day and make sure not to eat that much on a daily basis
bad idea lol
If you're a virgin, best thing to do is get some lubricant to carry along. and if you're smart, you'll masturbate some to get used to his size a bit beforehand
He shouldn't
Ask him, if you're going to marry him you should be able to talk about this stuff.
Not if he gobs on his fingers first during the lube up phase
How do you know he's well endowed?
So you claim not to have sex with him, but you know the size of his willy . LOL
lol
do lots of cunnilingus before penetration
I will probably not do it due to the fact I'm a wimp. But I belong to many things on the LGBT scale and my dad doesn't care, my mom dose but she's to busy to care about me. And I can't tell anyone else. I'm scared and people hate me so much I don't even know why. I have considered killing myself as well but I sorta don't want to die the way I am now. I just don't know when or how or anything. ;-;
Listen man. Get some confidence about yourself and tell your dad to SHUT THE **** UP. Then, talk to your mom and let her know how you really feel. If that don't work then hitch hike your *** somewhere else you can live to an aunt or grandma or something. Generally women tend to understand LGBT more than men. Whip your dad's *** too. Or don't. But DON'T kill yourself. It won't resolve anything, and you'll make your mom, your dad, aunt, grandma, grandpa, boyfriend, girlfriend, dog, cat, fish, and me cry man. ALSO Run away WHENEVER you want too.
Don't! From the second you step out the door you'll regret it. It might seem like your life is horrible, but you can get through it and stay strong
first 2morrow is always another day. an d your parents love u maybe they thewmselves just dont know how 2 deal with situation. talk 2 your mom just 2 of u. express all u feel.
don't run away,it's a bad idea
Sigh......and exactly what would you want your PARENTS to do about your sexuality or your sexual leanings???? I'm very confused.
While I'd have phrased it differently, I agree with Frank. You can't "feel" your sodium levels. That requires a blood test. Treating a condition you probably do not have is foolish and possibly dangerous. For three days, track the sodium levels of everything you eat without changing what you eat. I bet you'll find you're just fine. It's really difficult to get too little sodium.
While you can't just "feel" your sodium level drop, this is why low-carb diets are utter rubbish. They are fads. You'll lose some weight quickly while putting your body into mild ketosis and dehydration, slow your digestion due to protein overload, think you're good, go back to a normal, balanced diet, and gain all the weight back in 2-3 days. To answer your question: drink a gatorade and consult a nutritionist.
Shithead...YOU CLEARLY DON'T KNOW what your sodium levels are...and you will NOT know without testing. You can't just say "I feel my sodium levels are low" without any supporting information.
Sounds like a haemorrhoid. A common result of overly hard stools. Drink more water and eat more fibre and it shoul slowly go away.
You have an Haemorrhoid along with half of the Western world. Give it a google and go to the Pharmacy for treatment. I have had mine for 25 years.
Sigh....you're crazy. Totally paranoid. It's called a Hemorrhoid, dude.
Sounds like a typical Thrombosed hemorrhoid...I have had them since I was 10...on and off for 35 years now. Don't worry, you are far and away from dying.
Could be haemorrhoids, could be an infection. As a starting point, speak with a pharmacist and ask for their advice. They may be able to recommend a cream or they may suggest you speak with your GP. Important to follow up.
No, that is a lie put about by anti-circumcision activists. If circumcision detracted from sexual feeling then it would have been ceased long ago. The true fact is that sex is either no different or improved by circumcision. Too many folk think that a tight, non-retractable foreskin is normal and are thus missing out on much of the sexual pleasure that they should be getting from the desired direct contact between glans rim and vagina.
No, tens of millions of guys are cut and have normal sex and masturbate and feel just fine.
You have a higher chance of STD's when youre uncircumcised.
Well no... Since we enjoy sex very much.
no opposite. it makes it healthier and cleaner and stronger and more sensitive
it has served me well..............i wouldnt want to be more sensitive than what i am
make it harder to do
if you really need help then some help. others maybe there because someone wanted them there even though there was nothing wrong with them.
depends on your illness, how you react to treatment, YOUR cooperation
Hey! I've heard the male Penis stops growing around the age of 14-15. Many others will agree but you should research information from a bonafide source to get correct and accurate information. Mine grew till about that age and it gets big when I get excited. Lol! Can you please message me? inforeplyto@yahoo.com Thanx! Hope this helps! Good Luck!
Learn how to write correctly. You're old enough to be able to do that now. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16.
First of all no-one on here is qualified to correct your grammar, nor should they be. I'm sure your penis is large enough to hit that idiot over the head with it. Don't worry about your penis, trust me, the girls aren't worried about it. You'll be just fine.
The metric system. Use it.
I am an 18 year old female btw. ANY and ALL tips and advice are appreciated. If you ve been in the same situation, let me know things you wish you would have known before you started losing. Estimates on how long it should take from min to max would be appreciated also. Links/sources that are inspirational or will help are welcome.
Healthy weight loss is 1-2lbs per week. Give yourself at least 6 months to lose this weight. You are considered to be morbidly obese. You need a low carb, high protein diet of no more than 1200 calories a day.. Any additional activity you can manage will help.
I am a tea lover. I drink green tea, black tea, follower tea, ice tea... This is my first time to drink herbal weight loss tea. The taste is not bad. I drink one cup everyday. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product did make me a little bit lighter. I will keep drinking it to see what happens to me in long run .
very simple. "If it's white, don't bite". Best advice my dietician gave me. Eat Protein, Vegetables, Fruits, Dairy, and whole grains. Avoid White rice, white potato, white sugar, and white flour based products. You will lose quickly and effortlessly.
No cases of the hantavirus have been reported in Australia. There are close trading ties between Australia and Asian countries where both human and rodent Hantavirus infections are found, so importation of the virus is a continuing threat.
I don't even know whether Hantavirus exists in Australia; I am sure it is not widespread there. But for general information: Hantavirus does not spread in cities, but only in rural and wilderness areas. It is fairly rare to catch it even where it is endemic. Call your local health department, or even a doctor, to find out whether there is Hantavirus in your area. If you get sick, seek treatment. But I don't think you will.
Is hanta currently active there? Not every mouse has it,and its pretty much gone in the US. More than likely you are just fine.
Only if u inhale or EAT them
Yeah you are definitely hitting puberty, congrats! lol You will get a lot of those symptoms while on your period every month like cramps and nausea (It sucks i know, I'm sorry) And you'll probably feel tenderness or slight aches in your breasts while they develop as well. (but thats temporary) No one can really know for sure but I'd guess your period will be coming next month or like 3ish weeks maybe. The best person to really ask about this sort of thing is your mom. She can tell you all about how to prepare - the vitamins to take to relive cramps, and how to put on pads/tampons. Good luck with everything!
Your period will definitely be starting soon! It's hard to say, but it may be within the next week or two. I would talk to your mom so that you are prepared. Congratulations! It is not as bad as it is made out to be, with cramps just use a heating bad or take some ibuprofen. It sounds that you are prepared for it to start and that will make it much easier.
That the laugh is so joyous that it makes them laugh too. Examples of people with infectious laughs, Ricky Gervais (the best) Lisa Kudrow, Seth Rogen, Johnny Knoxville.
It means your laughing makes other people want to laugh too. That is usually a good thing, not in a bad way.
You make others laugh when you laugh because it's contagious, like an infection
You have the kind of laugh that makes them laugh too. Sometimes it's because they find your laughing amusing, and sometimes it's simply because your laugh is so "joyful & hearty" sounding that it makes them laugh too, not necessarily at you.
If they laugh, you start laughing too
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
Ok so for the past month and 1 week I have been eating very healthy and exercising 5 times a week (sometimes even 6 times ). I also go hiking every morning. My exercises are always different( cycling class, arm day, leg day, yoga class...etc.) I have also been keeping track of my calories. I eat 1,400 calories a day (sometimes over sometimes under). I'm 18 years old, female, 137 pounds, 63 inches. I don't eat carbs or dairy and I'v cut out sugar and any processed foods. When I first started this life style I was 136 lbs now I'm 137 lbs. Can someone please help me understand why I am not losing any weight. Thank you!
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing and by far the most effective pre work out supplement I've ever tried. It gives me a ton of energy to do a challenging work out and I feel uplifted for the rest of the day. I never feel discomfort or dizziness due to the caffeine levels and it relieves bloating. Great balance of ingredients .
Best way is to do it under 50 fathoms of water, both you and your weed, without any auxiliary source of air or oxygen. Good luck striking the matches too.
I don't smoke it anymore but I would say the safest way would be a glass pipe or bong. Simply because you don't inhale anything except the pot and the impurities in the lighter fluid. Keep it singular.
Filter it through water using a bong.
Are you a cop fishing?
Will give you the same answer as I gave the other silly child asking about it. Probably a harmless birthmark. If concerned talk to a parent or guardian. Your risk of vulvar cancer at your age is ZERO
Vulvar cancer is rare. Try here:
Talk to another trusted female adult, if there is someone who will help set your mind at ease.
It takes time and effort to lose weight and get in shape. The good thing is you can do it if you commit to it. Eat a healthy diet and exercise. That is the only way. Some tips are eat a diet high in fiber. Eat lean protein (protein is important to keep from losing muscle). Eat whole grains and at least 5 servings of fresh or frozen vegetables per day. Limit your sodium intake. But there is no secret formula. See a health care provider. They can help you get started on a program that will be more designed to your needs
Which military? Go to a concentration camp. You'll be in shape for a captured soldier. Go to a training camp. You'll get into fighting shape. Go to a school, you'll get into historical shape. Goals should be well defined. Have a plan to get there. Then execute that very specific plan. You already know what to do. Now do what you know to do. Diet and exercise. It isn't a secret. It's been done for thousands of years.
Focus on eating a healthy diet. Eliminate all sugar and artificial sweeteners. Eat yogurt full of probiotics on a daily basis. Take vitamin and mineral supplements. Exercise daily. Spend at least 3 hours a day outdoors.
Lose weight.
Get shredded bruh. Stop pussying around and do it.
Diet and exercise.
My eyesight is -5.00 in both my left & right side & my lenses aren't thick. In this day & age lenses can be made thiner, even if your prescription is higher. You won't be able to read things that are farther away as well as you used to be able to, but you aren't "blind" if that's what you're asking. You can still read things up close, like if you were reading a textbook on the desk in front of you, you'll be fine.
If you could read up close without glasses the day before the exam, then you still can the day after the exam , no matter how much he says it has changed. Why even ask that ? Look at a book in front of you without your glasses...can you see it ? There is your answer.
Have the doctor check you using an eye chart. Do not forget to leave your glasses on during the test.
Bad but not very bad!
Some may consider that as morally wrong. Some may consider that as fine.
If they use the pill or condoms so the girl can't get pregnant, and both siblings want to make love together then there's no problem. It's actually very common for horny teenage brothers and sisters to have sex as a fun and healthy way to release their hormones while physically expressing their love for each other, but most people just don't talk about it.
You've gotten a few opinions here but on the more practical side... There is ALWAYS a risk of pregnancy/STD's whenever you engage in sexual activity. You and your sister should both be tested (unless you're BOTH virgins) before you engage in any sexual activity with each other or anyone else for that matter. As far as any *harm* that could possibly come to either of you? There is no way to know for certain if one or both of you would be negatively affected. You should both think about it and have a long conversation BEFORE you engage in any sexual activity.
Teen brother and sister shouldnt do that, never. Its completely not normal and considered tobe disgusting. Brothers should find another girl and sister should find another boy.
They may be friends, however just think whether you can have sexual relation with your own sister. If so there is no difference between a whore and her. This is my view. Regards.
If you want to have sex Go do it with someone who you are not related to.
IT's INCEST that's why, it is considered a crime in some places.
it is just sick silly. A human should not have sex with a dog either
The problem simply lies with WHY THE **** WOULD YOU EVEN LOVE OR WANT YOUR SIBLING THAT WAY
That's a very good BMI. I would say normally for an 18yo that your weight is a little low but your height is also not average so it's mostly fine. Technically speaking, your ideal healthy weight is 118 but anywhere from 105-132 would be fine.
Oh yes, that's perfect. You must be so beautiful and thin :) I wish my girlfriend was like you but she weighs 200 lbs :(
Whoa baby!! Hell yes
you sound fine too me
thats okay
So I ve had a bit of trouble with my bowel movements over the last year or so, but it got better and has now got much worse again. My faeces are usually very hard and compacted, and even when they aren t it still is very sore to go. The pain is excruciating, and isn t getting any better. I ve previously has anusol cream and suppositories, and I m now taking regular laxatives but nothing seems to ease the pain much. There is also always bright red blood in the toilet and when I wipe. What could this be? I am reluctant to go back to my doctors again unless I really have to.
You have anal fissures and possibly hemorrhoids, probably caused by some medication you are taking or a poor diet. You should not be relying on laxatives and stool softeners for relief; as you can tell, they are not doing the trick. You absolutely must return to the doctor, but in addition you must address the cause, which will involve changing something in your current practices. I don't know anything about your medical history, but I would first suggest using water as a beverage instead of whatever else you are drinking, and a lot more of it.
You have probably have hemorrhoids due to constipation Stop taking laxatives, your body is dependent on them. You need to change your diet. No more than 1/4 of your diet should be meat. 1/4 should be whole grains. 1/2 fruit and veggies. You should drink half a cup of water per hour you are awake. Avoid dairy, white flour, rice, white bread. No soda or sugar. Avoid fatty foods. No chocolate. For sooner relief, drink prune juice to soften things up. And take warm baths with epsom salts. (Sitz bath) That should help it heal.
Of course you need to go to a doctor. I would recommend a GI doctor to help with the slow bowel.
U may have hemroids I have no idea how to spell it go to the doctor
You need a physician. You also need to change your diet.
I assure you, this is it. It works just as well if not better. Also, I had no side effects as I did with the products that didn't even work very well. You can buy this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme with confidence.
Porn addiction is really hard to control, i am 18 and when im horny i masturbate with porn so were almost the same, theres no fun for me masturbating w/o porn, but still i can get erection. You have ED and so you might need to take a break at porn, refrain yourself from masturbating too much with porn. Just tell her your sorry you cant get it hard and just ask her to date or have picnic just to stir your mind away from porn. Porn ruins how we perform, its a fake sex, it makes us think that it is true but the reality is not so we were upset and thus cant get our full satisfaction.
Liposuction.

Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
I got circumcised when I was 19 and can say there are only pro's. It's cleaner, healthier, looks better IMO and yes, feels better. It was a revelation to be honest. And yes, masturbation feels awesome. I am sure you can find some p*rn with dudes masturbating that are circumcised in case you're wondering. I can also tell you that girls prefer a clean cut man. Especially for oral ;-)
Do not take any notice of cut guys who say they got circumcised and everything is way better , remember they were in most cases circumcised because they had a problem with there penis or brain so its bound to better after because it was bad before , but there is no getting away from the fact that when it comes to the penis less is not more , cutting bits off containing lots of touch sensitive nerves is not normally going to make your penis more fun unless its got a disease or something , and another myth that is B.S. is that being cut gives you added protection from sti's and hiv that's total crap.
Please see http://www.circinfo.net/pdfs/GFM_EN_2015... for some of the proven lifelong medical benefits of being circumcised. Circumcision does not adversely affect sexual pleasure - indeed it often improves it. Being circumcised reduces the risk of ever catching EACH of several STIs by up to 60%. This alone is a worthwhile reason to get circumcised. Girls who know the difference greatly prefer a circumcised partner as they know there can be no foul smegma or infections lurking under the foreskin waiting to be deposited into their mouth or vagina. I for one am very pleased to have been circumcised as a baby. A close friend chose circumcision at age 23 and has been glad of it ever since. Circumcision has no drawbacks.
Don t get circumcised!!!! Masturbation will not feel the same (loss of sensitivity) and after a while you will regret it! Be glad you parents left you uncut.
all cons and not a single pro
maybe circumcision expose penis head to air, air can enter urethra opening easier then create gas in stomach which disrupt digestion, impair ability to fart.
People say you loose sensitivity but then you last longer lol(I'm circumsised)
Thank God I'm circumsized
masturbation will be more pleasurable with uncut cock as the foreskin moves up and down. Regards.
It's just cause you haven't drank any fluids and your urine is just dark yellow as a result. Happens to me too every morning and I drink loads of water every day, you're fine man.
It's normal. It sits in the bladder longer and becomes concentrated. You're fine. If you drink more at night you may have to start getting up to urinate during the night.
Normal you drink water all day so you are hydrated. then you are still hydrated when you go to bed but your body uses that water through out the night,
Hi jessica yes it is normal we all do it.
yellow is the normal color
You should drink more water
No because a person can have cancer with no symptoms but will be in severe pain with appendicitis.
Appendicitis can be confirmed by a common blood test.
Sure, it happens all the time in a parallel universe. Here, where we have medical professionals who actually know what they're doing, never.
Not normally, unless perhaps cancer of the appendix.
no it can't
If you want to bulk, there are lots of websites with good info on what to do. You can join one - a lot of them have apps, such as MyFitnessPal. You'll have to eat more protein and start lifting.
Lit weights, eat adequate protein.
Doing just a few heavy reps will build muscle.
do weight training
what's the question?
No reason to be feeling guilty. Just embarrassed. Next time do it so you don't get caught.
nest time do it with the door locked. nothing to worry about we all do this and been caught. i do not know why boys do not do this in the bath room with the door locked.
Nothing you can do but move forward and ignore that it happened
why? you are a male, it's normal
tell her everyone does it and always lock the door
The first line of defense against depression and anxiety is B vitamins. Get nutritional yeast powder and/or B-100 pills. Vitamin B2 is a water soluble dye that turns urine bright yellow. When the color fades, it's time for another pill. Read some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right. I have the same problem you do. I have to keep a bottle of B-100 near me all the time.
You are extremely valuable to this world, and even if everything seems grim, there's always hope for you. Don't give up as you can make it through. If you do need some extra help, call the suicide hotline.
Go see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
See a therapist, counselor. Wasting time being unhappy is a waste. Get help, be happy.
Please dont Believe in yourself
Join the club. You simply have prostate issues or a swollen prostate. Almost all men your age and older have the same issue. There are ways to make it less of a problem but you need to see a doctor for that.
Go see urologist, dude, may just take a simple daily pill to fix that problem. Or might just need to get 'rimmed out" to remove calcium deposits in your urethra. Simple procedure. But worth it.
Find a good naturopathic doctor.
Time for a prostate check-up .....

Lots of lube! It may feel uncomfortable but it works wonders and if there rubbing and touching you at the same time it distracts you from the pain. It hurts getting in once your passed that you should be fine
Relax your anal muscles. Try using a small dildo until your anal muscles relax and open up oh and dont play a jumpscare game while hes giving you anal your anus will clamp down so fast and hard he'll be screaming amd crying for his mother.
Train your anus. Start with something small and once everything is loosened up start increasing the size of the object. Soon you will be able to fit a baseball bat in there, no problem. Just take it slow.
Use lots of lube, do it face to face, not doggie, and try to relax more. Report back.
Fingering helps relax the Anusara and prepare it for something bigger
Fist yourself
if you use lube and a condom and take your time it shouldn't hurt
extra lube and extra slow/careful.
Find someone smaller.
it'll get better
evolving viruses? no. that's complete nonsense. mutating viruses, like medical excuses for their failure to get sick well are evolving constantly, but neither have anything to do with the cause. they can't and never will "cure" a cold. the only solution is already within, but recognizing that fact isn't profitable. the best solution is prevention by staying free of nerve interference which predisposes infection. over the years i have witnessed many people who used to get colds that no longer do after receiving chiropractic care, disproving the "evolving virus" theory. medicine is long on pseudoscientific excuses, and very short on what matters, results. see an hio method chiropractor.
Viruses mutate and evolve constantly. Sorry.
There'll never be a cure because those viruses keep on evolving.
"I m 14 5 5 and weigh 116lb and can t lose weight?" At five foot five inches tall, and one hundred sixteen pounds, you do NOT need to lose weight, as it is now you are just barely within the healthy low weight, for your height, and that is by only about one pound. Being underweight, can actually be even more unhealthy than someone who is overweight by a few pounds. The more underweight you are, the greater the health issue risks increase. At five foot five inches, the median weight is one hundred twenty five pounds.
There's nothing wrong with the weight that you are.
Maybe because you don't need to lose weight.
No this is a sign you have brain damage. Operate ASAP, if you wait to get to the doctor you probably wont make it. Grab a hammer and an ice cream scoop and start operating NOW before its too late!
It's a rare disease. I'm allergic to my boyfriend; he makes me wet 🙄
Funny, I saw that on college humours best reddit questions as well. Always annoying to see someone recycling a joke as their own
No. Because when you wake up, everything is as usual.
No, you're simply aroused.
no. you are attracted to her. is this a joke
probably because your 13 and your foreskin hasnt fully detatched yet just keep trying to pull it back and it will loosen :)
Disregard Tristan. He has no idea what he's talking about. You should be pulling your foreskin back everyday and washing under there with warm soapy water. This is something you should have been doing for many years now. Hygiene is everything bro. You don't want a smelly, nasty penis.
You're probably joking Pitbull... But my mom pulled my foreskin back and cleaned mine until I was 16. (Not everyday, but often) She stopped once she had me circumcised.
In addition to Brad's comment, I'll just say, do it when flaccid, not erect.
mom always cleaned mine
Definitely not.... Also, don't you post this question a lot? I've seen at least four similar questions.
Nope, never, uh uh, absolutely, positively, irrevocably NO!
of course not - especially if the boy is also naked - that's child porn - major CRIME
thats so wrong,you are ruining your sons life,hes mentally and emotionally scarred or life.
deffinitely far away from normal...
No :/ weirdo
f*ck you and your dumb @$$ repetitive questions
No. It is not OK.
no... I will punish her
NO!
Your mom's lung cancer is unrelated since it is a totally different disease. You have 2 unrelated female relatives that were diagnosed with the single most common form of cancer found it women. This does not sound like there is a strong genetic link. But, bring it up with our doctor. Maybe they can do some testing to see if you have the genetic mutations that make cancer more likely. Even then, you may not get it.
You have one 2nd degree relative and 1 3rd degree relative who have been diagnosed with breast cancer. These people are unrelated to each other. You have a 1st degree relative diagnosed with a totally unrelated lung cancer. None of this suggesrs a pattern of cancer in your family or anything more than an average csncer risk fo you. So your lifetime risk of any cancer is 30% with your  lifetime risk of breast cancer being 12.5%
You probably have a normal chance of getting breast cancer.
Taking the pill for 5 years reduces your bc risk, as does breastfeeding your future children. A relative on maternal side and A relative on paternal side just shows it's not hereditary cancer...
Unless mum also carries the breast cancer gene then no you dont have a 50 per cent chance.
You're overreacting. 1. they got cancer at what age? 50? 60? What age are you??? do the math. 2. alot of cancer is completely treatable NOW. It probably won't even exist in 20-30 years.
There are things that people can do to help prevent cancer. Monosodium Glutamate causes cancer, so read food ingredient labels and if any foods contain MSG, leave them on the supermarket shelves.
You can, and should have genetic testing done for the BRCA gene. That will help you to clarify your options. I think it's prudent to make sure your check ups are done in a timely fashion. Caught early most cancers are highly curable now. So it pays to keep up the scheduled check ups.
Also, do not forget that Energy drinks have more caffeine than soda which may not be listed as food to avoid but the pulse goes up even if you happen to be elevated wrong like if you were lying on the floor after reading a book or watching TV. Even seeing a spider can bring the pulse up which may sound funny but little things can bring it up even second hand smoke can contributor to it.
There are an infinite number of factors than can contribute to a high pulse. Stress, excitement, anxiety, fever, infection, hormones, cardiac conditions, the list goes on and on.
Mine is usually quite high and I am told it is because of stress as my blood pressure is very good
Its usaully cause by stress
bad eating habit and stresses
Given about 70% of all guys have some type of same sex experience, Nope. Just normal curiosity and horny guys result in many guys having some sex fun with a friend. Gay ONLY means you have sexual attraction for males, not females. Playing around with a buddy to just get off is normal and does not "turn you".
Nearly all boys think about experimenting with another boy, but most don't actually do it or only try the once. This does not make them gay. Being gay means having a sexual desire towards other males to the exclusion of females.
No actually you won't. Sex is an act and sexuality is about what you prefer so you could experiment and still be straight.
No you experimented that's fine we all need to experiment with this kind of stuff. If you liked it that doesn't mean your guy you need to experiment with a girl and what ever you like better is for you doesn't matter which one
Being gay is when your sexually attracted to someone of the opposite sex.. If your not attracted to them sexually then no it's not gay, just expirementing.
No, this would not make you gay. A lot of guys experiment out of curiosity and/or mutual satisfaction, but it does not make you gay.
nope, it's a nvery common thing between stragiht dudes, but very few talk about that. to be gay is another thing, or not enought
At least Bi-Curious. A straight male wouldn't be interested in engaging sex with a male.
Being gay is more of a lifestyle.
Yes. Within 24 hours, you must tattoo the word "phaggot" on your butt. It sounds more Greekish that way, especially next weekend.
I was wondering if men carry out their sex fantasies on their wife. Some sex fantasies would include handcuffing or tying their wife to the bed spread eagle style so that his wife is retrained while he has sexual intercourse with her. Another one would be to hold his wife down while he has sexual intercourse with her. Does the man also fondle his wife's breasts. Does the wife ever have cowgirl style sex with her husband. Does the wife ever suck her husbands penis. I'm just wondering if married couples do those kind of sexual acts with each other and also have children.
I am sure many of them do. I am sure that many men play out their wives sex fantasies. I have never been married. I know plenty of people who have. They tell me that after two people who have been together for awhile and the passion fizzles out in the marriage, they look for new ways to spice things up in the bedroom. What was off limits when they first started dating or when they were first married get second considerations after about 5, 10, 15 or more years.
Some do, some are simply to scared or feel to guilty to bring up the subject. So they pay for a photographer to take pictures of young girls playing around a pool or in the surf topless, do nature walks with nothing on but panties, or topless playing in a nursery scene. I know because that is exactly what put me through college, I was a topless model part time for two years.
It depends on the couple and if they are open with each other. But yes those are very tame fantasies. Even with children. You will have to wait 6 weeks after the baby. By then they'll you'll know when they sleep.
Mine just watches porn when im not around..pert near exclusively since he got me pregnant last year. But yes, healthy couples who love each other and are comfortable with one another 'explore' together sexually. I think kinky sex is more common than most people can imagine. Then again some couples might just be happy with missionary their whole lives.
Everything HERE depends on the mental health of the individual.
Of course they do, as long as their partner is willing
Even i have such doubt.. No idea.i am young and unmarried.. Let us c what others would say..
I stopped growing before 15.
I didn't. I was done by 15. If there was anything after that, it was a fraction. The only way you could possibly gain what you want is if your family were tall and you've only just got your period. Even then, pushing it.
I'm no girl but people grow in spurts until just under 20
You can ask as many times as you like and it will have as much effect on your height as wanting to be tall. You have stopped.
None
I work out 5 days per week, and eat rougly .8 grams of protein per lb of body weight per day. Don't forget your protein, you will not grow without it. If you're attempting to lose fat while you're doing it, and not eating, this is your problem. You will not make any gains at all if you do not eat. If you're having problems getting pumped in the gym, try getting a pre-workout supplement, find an app on your phone for monitorin macros, that is, fat, carbs, and protein.
What is your lifting program like? Are you eating a significant excess of calories?
If you're eating bad food it won't work
Find some big happy churches, attend age-appropriate groups there and have fun. Talk with the pastor/minister; where else can you get counseling for free? Get into some bible study groups. Read your bible and find out how loved you are. That's the best way to love yourself -- knowing that God loves you more than you can possibly imagine :)
I know it will be hard for you to know how would you make your self happy. But the only thing I can suggest is go to a place where you can meditate and have time for yourself. Sometime we over think of things that is unreasonable and changeable. Life is full of beautiful things go out and explore you wouldn't know you discovered something very close to what your searching for. Only you knows what makes you happy.
mirror work. Have you heard of that before. You go to a mirror and tell yourself that you love you and you're happy to see you and give yourself compliments.
By Living a healthy lifestyle, like go to gym, eat healthy food, dress up yourself, and travel the world.
Start with a gentle massage
Well, start by dimming the lights, putting on some soft music...
give yourself a compliment and mean it.
Talking to yourself doesn't make you crazy. A lot of people do it.
No, it's totally fine. Sometimes, it's a reminder, Instead of keeping track of the things inside your head, you can say them verbally. You will remember your verbal thoughts more than your mental ones.
im 14 and i do that its called a conscience its normal.
not just for talking, but for arguing with yourself.
No. You need to eat three meals a day or you will get hungry and binge. Exercise won't make you lose weight, but it will make you burn your calories off more effectively. You have to cut your intake but eat enough to keep your metabolism high. The better the fuel you put into a fire, the hotter it burns, so that's what eating and metabolism are like. Eat the right amount for the size of the body you want. Don't attempt to "diet." If diets worked, everyone would be thin. No one can stay on a diet.
Turn a fan on high and point it towards your face. Then watch a Hillary Clinton speech on YouTube and you'll be out like a light in no time. I've used this technique multiple times and it always works.
1)Try to force yourself to stay awake 2)Hide your clock 3)Cool your room 4)Take a warm shower before bed 5)Wear socks to bed 6)Immerse your face in very cold water for 30 seconds 7)Picture your favorite place 8)Listen to music 9)Eat dinner by candlelight 10)Practice progressive relaxation
Suck a dîck
try masturbating to orgasm, this should help you to relax
Yes, boys have raging hormones so sex is always on their minds. They end up using girls which breaks their hearts. Find better friends that will take care of each other and not allow you be alone with a boy.
Yes. The boy was saying that if you didn't let you have sexual interaction with him he would suicide or insult himself. He was basically threatening you.
Yes. He took advantage of you and manipulated you into doing what he wanted.
I haven't. I actually went to the 2nd of 6 therapy sessions I will be taking, today. As of now, I don't believe I ever will deal with them, but I know that this isn't rational thinking. Hopefully in the future my views will change. To be fair, it's hard to think rationally when extremely depressed, and when you have an anxiety disorder.
Every single person has looked back and felt remorse. Big deal. Can't be changed. It's wasted emotion.
no i didn't and i just grew up and got on with my life
Gotta give it all to God, so he can forgive you. Then forgive yourself and move on.
Quite the while. With a lot of effort and dedication you can lose 1 to 2 pounds a week so in 6 months you'd lose about 40 pounds. But it's not easy, you'll hit a bump after you get rid of the water weight but you need to keep pushing towards your goal. But losing weigh will be about working out and dieting correctly. Many people give up dieting because they don't see any improvement but that's because when they eat that salad, they put way too much dressing or when they eat avocados they don't realize the fat content. It'll be hard the first few weeks but you'll get used to it soon.
Following this diet, you will be down to 110-120 lbs within 3 months. Eat these foods only... beef, hamburger (no bun), pork, hot dogs (no bun), chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, butter, nuts, green salad with a little dressing. Pick one day a week, the same day and eat other foods in moderation. When you get discouraged, ask your self "what do I hate worse, being fat or no carbs".
Get down to 140 and thats it. don't get any skinnier than that. Guys love curvy girls. try to find a boyfriend whether he is your age or older than u. this will boost your self worth and self esteem tremendously. Become a more flirtatious talkative person and everyone will be attracted to your vivacious personality.
Recently I've been thinking of moving out of my parents since I've been mostly living for them (paying bills,medication etc) Ive realized I put their lives before mine and as I've turned 19 ive realized I have yet to learn what it is to be an adult. Thinking of moving out has made me happier since I've had depression should I save up to move out ? From CA to AZ
This is a tough one. Its normal at your age to want to live on your own. A lot of families are living together these days though, because the cost of living has changed so much. If your parents are disabled or need help, you may still want to help them. There are so many variables to something like this. Is there someone else older you can talk to who can help you make the right choice?
Yes, save up. To rent an apt, you need first and last months rent, deposit for water and electric, car, job, etc. -------- Unless you have a college degree, it's better to get a job first, before you move.
Saving up to move sounds awesome, be sure to stay on psychiatric medication.

Well, we can usually tell the difference between a penis that is 5 inches or 7 inches. Your penis at 5 inches is perfectly fine and a good size.
You could, but once she sees it, she will know you lied! This is why I'm always honest about mine even though its smaller than yours. Mine is 4-4.5 inches.
I was halfway through this bottle and almost gave up until my wife convinced me to just try the entire bottle. Now she loves to tell me how she was right. My performance is perfect. My penis is too hard. She says that My penis looks bigger. Prolargentsize saved my sex life.
If you are only 5 inches, any woman will know and be disappointed. Some will laugh and leave and other will be angry and kick you repeatedly in the testicles.
Yeah you could. I'm surprised no-one ever thought of that before. < M
dont lie then she'll get disappointed bc she'll know as soon as she see it
She has her hole to check if it does not reach her D point
the more experienced (hoes) may be more picky
aww why slowly kill yourself? is it for attention or do you really want to kill yourself? well go on, almost anybody can purchase a gun now in the U.S. Finish your entire plate, get the job done. But in the end we all know you won't do it. So get your head out of the damn gutters and do something with your life
well if it doesnt work then give up its not a good thing either. plz stop :( I'm going to try persuading you anyway

not sharp enough.
The Standard American Diet (SAD) appears to be the problem here. Refined food products and animal based food products can cause eating problems. I recommend that you read books and watch videos by Douglas J. Lisle, Neal Barnard, John McDougall, and Dean Ornish. The terrible SAD is the cause of the rapid increase in obesity in American since 1985. Learn how to eat a Whole Food, Plant-Based diet. This does not require hunger, measurement, or portion control.
That is normal actually. You need to eat less at a sitting and eat more frequently. It doesn't take long for the food to go from the stomach to the colon. Even large amounts don't take long to digest and start its absorption. So the more frequently you eat, the less hungry you will be.
Metabolism
Fats in your foods help you feel full and satisfied. You are essentially eating low-fat everything. This is great for weight control or weight loss but you are experiencing the down side of it.
LMAO.... not getting your information from other brain dead middle schoolers. There's no such thing as ****-induced erectile dysfunction moron.
I used the Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product just to see if it would work or not after trying so many others and with no success , I was truly Impress this product is better than viagra, it performs just as it says could not believe it would but it did I would use again and buy it again it was great.
No such thing as PIED = complete myth. Probably suffering from growing up. < M
**** will ruin a sex life
The side effects go away if you aren't taking the medication. If you have chronic, debilitating side effects then talk to your doctor.
Depends on which medicine and which effect. Erectile difficulties are the biggest "deal breaker" for most people, and your doctor can usually switch you to another medicine - because they don't all do that...
Yes, but take time.
given enuf time, yes
As long as they are composite (tooth colored fillings) you can eat whatever you want as the fillings are as solid as they will ever be. The only precaution is eating/chewing while you are numb so you don't injure yourself. Eat slow and with small bites.
No, these days the fillings set hard in minutes. Carry on as normal. I worked for a UK Dentist.
gum, sticky foods like hard sweets, things that can put your fillings. Also no soda pop
Nice soft foods for a few hours....
i do not know
Even though this could be many things, serious or minor. If your heart beats FAST and you have chest pain it possibly means your heart is working extra hard to pump blood to your body and through your veins and arteries. The heart could possibly be working extra hard because of clogged arteries, generally this causes heart attacks. Symptoms of heart attacks are shaped chest pain and shortness in breath and inability to breath. Be sure to let your parents know and see a doctor as soon as possible!
Definitely see a doctor. It's better to be safe than sorry.
Chest pain is generally always a matter you want to bring up to your doctor.
see an hio method chiropractor.
see a doctor pls
I am a 15 year old girl who is 5 9 1/2 and I weigh around 98-100 pounds. I have been eating between 500 and 1100 calories for around 5 months and obviously lost a lot of weight and now want to be healthy again. I also need to gain a few pounds before my doctors appointment in a couple days, but overall want to be healthy and gain some weight safely. Please help!!!
You could easily be on a 1600 calorie per day diet at that age and still be underweight. I would shoot for something near that. 500-1100 cals per day is extremely low, even if you were 5' tall. More so, make sure the calories are healthy. Don't eat a bag of chips and decide that it was half of your calories for the day, don't even count them because there's no real sustenance in them, just empty. You'll burn the excess easily with any exercise.
Try eating healthy but adding in 2 nutrition drinks or smoothies made with protein powder. And have dessert most days😊
Maybe not ideal but it will suffice. Prehistoric man seldom slept 8 hours straight, getting rest when and where the conditions were right. That habit still exists in our genes. Many people take an afternoon nap and wake up refreshed. Our sleep habits very gradually changed over thousands of years leading up to the concept of getting 8 hours sleep during the night. We no longer have to worry about getting attacked by predators while we sleep. The four footed kind anyway.
Yes it is. 6 plus 2 is 8 lol. You have the ability to get to REM sleep in the first 6.
It's not ideal. Sleep Experts will tell you that it's best to get 8 hours straight. Rather than split it up.
Yes.
It used to be the norm to sleep in 2 sessions.
Well , I go to bed at 11.45 fall asleep quite quickly ,but wake up around 03.00 to have a pee ,and go back to bed .
yes
well no that way will cause sleep defecit which would build up over time and cause problems
It suffices.I sleep split all the time.
Zinc is found in cells throughout the body. It is needed for the body's defensive (immune) system to properly work. It plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of carbohydrates. Zinc is also needed for the senses of smell and taste. During pregnancy, infancy, and childhood the body needs zinc to grow and develop properly. Zinc also enhances the action of insulin. Iron is important because your body needs it to make the protein called hemoglobin. Without hemoglobin your red blood cells can't carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body.
Because it's easy to get Iron deficiency anemia...and you don't want that. Zinc is also great for you and prevents sickness.
Because most boys are using a lot of them up. < M

Don't ruin your vision. Just go online, pick out a pair of frames, and have clear lenses put in them with no prescription. You don't want to ruin your vision. Glasses are expensive and having bad vision is a major pain.
Are you kidding me? Grow up. Ruin your vision? I have horrible vision and id pay to have perfect vision and not to have to wear contacts or glasses. So so immature. Get fake ones, then grow up before causing physical, PERMANENT harm to your body for the sake of your superficial desire to wear glasses. People amaze me.
You can buy glasses without a prescription in them if there is a frame that you like. Just so you know, glasses with a prescription cost hundreds of dollars and it's rarely covered by insurance.
get fake glasses don't ruin your visions
Read a lot and put your face very close to what you're reading. Also spend a lot of time on your laptop.
Okay everyone it was a joke
Honestly, don't worry about it. I am also 13 and have had periods for about 8 months. In my case, my first and second periods were closer together than my 2nd and 3rd. In your first few years of periods, they are not usually regular and ovulation is not every single month. In time it will settle, for now really all you can do is relax and carry pads/tampons with you.
In your first 2 to 3 years, things are a bit rough. Your cycle is not fully formed and working yet. You only ovulate a few times, not every month. As time goes by, it will become more regular and predictable, and you will learn the signs you get when your period is coming. In the mean time, all you can do is relax and go on with your life. Nothing is out of the ordinary and worrying just makes it worse. Take care!
Hi... sometimes our periods are irregular for a while after we start our first one. I doubt you have any problem. Your body is still maturing.
When I had them the only way I was able to get rid of them was to go to a professional lice remover. You sit in a barber's chair for an hour or two while they systematically look through your hair and find and remove every single bug and egg (and they also give you instructions on how to de-louse your house, where there may also be eggs lurking).
Hannah, read this whole article, including the readers' comments.....note the recommendation for using Dawn Dish Soap....good luck. http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/...
You can go to some salons which will remove them

If the sperm was still alive then it is possible but normally sperm ide off within a few minutes of reaching the air - why would you want to do that if there is a chance of pregnancy? Tell her to be careful with taking unwanted within 72 hours as it doesnt always work after 24 hours and can mess up her periods and cannot be taken more than 3 times per year or it is ineffective, Good Luck
Here's how it works. If you and/or your partner are underage, uneducated, unemployed/underemployed, or living at home - then she could damn near get pregnant if you hold hands for too long. If you and/or your partner are addicted to drugs/alcohol - she can damn near get pregnant if you look at each other in the eyes for too long. Meanwhile, there are educated, employed, established adult couples who might go for months or even years trying to conceive. The irony is painful.

You're not short, but you're unlikely to be tall like your dad. Genetics work that way. You've got shorter genes in your family that are helping to keep you a more normal height. You'll probably still grow another inch or two, but if you haven't grown in a tear, you may be done. I'm a 5'7 adult, and that's no problem. At 5'8 it won't matter.
Certainly could have stopped, you don't get all your height genetics from your dad so the genes that made him tall may not be dominant in you. Guys do finish growing anywhere from 15-18.
Probably not. But why panick in this situation where you are taller than others? I mean i was 5'6" and im 18. So, think again, are you small???
Maybe, maybe not. Some people grow in spurts. You might grow a few inches within a few months.
My guess is you'll be at least 5'11.
Ask your doc. Take x-rays of the bones. If growth plates are closed or not... healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...
Im 14 yrs old and 4'11 and 120 lbs. On May 27th (its May14th right now) theres a end of the year pool party and everyone of my friends are skinny and i have a chunky stomach and legs and i was wonder if anyone had any TIPS or ADVICE about how to lose weight quickly and bring down a few pounds and inches before the 27th
Cardio and eat right. Probably lose 5 lbs or so.
Run and eat healthy, cut out all of the bad foods
It can't be done "fast".
You either handle it or be miserable. The world is filled with issues like that. Doctors and the media give such little information about cancer prevention, because cancer treatment is a multi $$ billion a year business. So get cancer and then come for treatment.
If felt better, I could cope just fine
Find a church that you love, and start going there.
seek Jesus and then it wont be meaningless...
Before you throw away all activity, and before you use what sounds like hokum, try using a pair of braces for your feet every night. Just look up 'plantar faciitis brace' on Amazon. $25 there, my first came from the doctor's office and was $125. Changed my world. Every night, don't overtighten.
I'm treating the same condition right now. You need to wear a night splint to stretch it. Also, doing stretches during the day helps. I've heard that rolling your foot across a tennis ball or soup can will help, but personally I think it just makes it hurt worse. Stretching it is the cure, but it takes time. Pain relief spray isn't going to heal it.
of course it won't cure it, nobody knows what the underlying cause is, most ama type doctors don't, they only treat symptoms....that's as good as it 's gonna get with them folk....that;s their racket, treat return, treat return treat return....get it?
It's not unusual for teenagers to have passing attractions to the same sex. Your hormones are in overdrive and they can also make you feel unbalanced emotionally. So, don't be too down on yourself. It doesn't mean that you are gay.
the first thing you need to do is go to God in prayer......find a quiet place and just start speaking to Him............remember that God is not a "magic genie" that will answer your prayer immediately, BUT also know that He will hear you and help you...........and if you don't already attend a Church that teaches Scripture correctly, there is info in the link

Hi, I'm a 14 year old male. Last year I was self conscious about my body image so i decided to exercise and lose weight. I've lost 15 kg (33 lbs) so far and it's been amazing. The only problem is that my family members and almost everyone that knows me says I look very old and my face is very wrinkly. Im only 14! Please help! Is there any way to make me look younger again? Thank you for any help.
Congratulations on losing weight! A few years ago, I lost a lot of weight, because my body was smaller and my face was more narrow, I had loose, wrinkly skin on my face and body. Overtime, my skin shrank to match the smaller size of my face and body. Just be patient and your skin will shrink, then you won't have wrinkles.
I have almost been on them a week and I can already tell a difference in my clothes. You have to drink Weight Loss Green Store Tea product throughout the day in order to get the full effect. I have the energy to exercise and I feel great .
Your face will fill out on it's own in time. Just eat and exercise normally.
you're probably over exercising and its causing your body to grow weary
Unlikely-- would have to be so hard it caused permanent damage-- and only the testicle- a slap on the penis would have nothing to do with fertility.
It is highly unlikely that you would become infertile from this, but slightly possible.
yes if slapped with a cricket/baseball bat very hard
Depends on how hard the slap was...
If it is a hard enough hit, yes.
no it can't
no
Acid Reflux, Anxiety, too much Caffeine? It could be anything, just talk to your doctor, they're educated in this. For now, try taking a TUMS, they're amazing and have worked for me. Also try to drink plenty of water, that always helps anything you have, especially if you've just had a lot of caffeine or an infection.
Maybe you have acid reflux? What is your diet like? If it's full of junky fast foods and processed foods, this isn't healthy. If this doesn't stop in a few days, make a doctor appt. I'm sure they would be happy to help and figure out what's going on.
I have the same issue. It's a really bad feeling. Mine goes away after I eat something, so try eating. Or sip on some ginger ale.
Oh I'm so sorry to hear that but I can tell you that my mother used to do the same and her behavior was like that because she thought I'm just trying to be annoying but if you sit with her and talked to her with honesty she will definitely care I mean she is mother and I'm sure won't be happy when she knows you are desperate.
That's sucks :( I'm 15 girl and my mom does that too. She even called me fat and says it's obvious and no wonder I'm sad. Little did she know I suffered bulimia at that time and I'm very depressed and suicidal. She stopped now but only because I have anorexica and just got out the hospital. Lol parents sucks
It's great that you are reaching out for help! We are so sorry to hear that you have been feeling so much emotional pain. It really does sound like you have been going through a lot especially with your mother. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as an aunt, uncle, friend s parent, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. Please consider getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT

You may lose weight sure but it probably won't stay off and it seems very unbalanced. My advice: Don't do anything now to lose weight that you can't do for the rest of your life. It needs to be sustainable (and healthy/balanced). If it isn't - it isn't worth your time.
When I drink Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea #in the morning, it curbs my appetite, reduces my cravings, and gives me more energy! This tea also keeps me going to the bathroom regularly instead of going 3-4 times a week.I lost the pounds and even more (28 pounds total)! I have just ordered the new bottles from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea
Yes, your weight should fall of very fast if you successfully follow this diet. However, I don't recommend you continue this program after the weight is gone because it doesn't seem like enough calories but that depends on your height age gender etc.
What's depression? ... “Been smokin’ weed for over 40 years with no ill effects whatsoever.” ----Spoken by a obese. near illiterate, out of work. 55 year old, high-school dropout living in his mother's basement and too stoned to care..
Yes - it helps some people. You just have to try it. Sometimes it just makes people feel weird and they don't continue to take it. But it's hard to know. Marijuana affects people very differently. At least it's relatively harmless. It works for depression because often in depression you'll have a sort of "worn out - abandoned" sense - as if there's nothing left in life. But with marijuana, you are exposed to the energy of the unconscious mind which is very rich and interesting place. This is why people enjoy the drug. And that can sweep away some depression.
Maybe but it won't fix the depression, so as soon as you're not high anymore, you'll be depressed again. Better to go to a counselor, therapist, find out the cause of the depression and get proper treatment.
That's not a guarantee. Everybody reacts differently to it. It makes some people crazy and overreact to every little thing. It's not a good habit to start honestly.
No, it will make you a pothead, and you'll still be depressed, only broke and now an addict. It ALWAYS starts as recreational use. I've yet to see it end at that.
Yes, if you smoke the right kind for you. It can prevent depression.
Being stoned does not fix depression.
It is a depressant, so probably not.
Try a different Probiotic. Also eat a yogurt like Activia to benefit digestion and your intestinal flora.
Yes - maybe they're working. Mostly these probiotics do exactly nothing. But if you need them, they're going to change the bugs inside your gut - and during that time you'll probably have some odd feelings. There's 100 TRILLION bugs inside of you..... so there's plenty of changes to be made inside there.
Probiotics only add extra cost to your diet bill and causes upset tummies for most. This fad supplement lacks evidence of benefits. http://genomemedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13073-016-0300-5
Evidence shows that probiotics have no effect on gut flora.
Not a dumb question at all. Yes, if you use a straw to drink sodas it will not cause as much decay.
maybe..even though you might think that it doesnt touch your teeth, it probably does, it runs over your tongue, mixes into your spit and eventually gets on your teeth. dont worry though..just make sure you brush your teeth and limit how much soda you drink, otherwise your teeth will decay faster since i think soda is acidic, so it will dissolve your teeth like coffee.
yes, it may be if it touch your teeth.you should be very careful ans the soda is very srong soft drink.it can cause type 2 diabetes,weight gain and many other problems.you should not drink it
It can still cause cavities if one does not brush often.
Yup.
Well, if you swallow *** from lots of different men during one session, you run the risk of ending up with an STD from at least one of them. But, go ahead if you really want to. You know you can get an STD from oral sex, don't you?
*** doesn't belong in your stomach. As a man that sounds supper gross.
No. a lady swallows only directly from her own husband.
As safe as having unprotected sex with multiple men at the same time.
I'm next
sure it is and go for it

Hey, if you can get off 3 times in a row that's quite impressive. If you aren't sore from that, no harm. At 18 you are at your peak level of sexuality so may need that much release. Average guy does it at least once a day at your age
Stop asking the same damn question. This is ridiculous that any human could be stupid enough for that to be the case. Find a question that isn't a waste of my time to read/respond to
Good for you, keep it up. No when I was 18 I was doing the same thing, oh wait I'm 21 and I still do it now!! Ha ha ha, ask me anything.
No it's not too much at all, it's very common an normal, your just fine
One of my friends has been talking to her school guidance counselor, which lead to her seeing her doctor and she recommended her to talk to this person from a gov mental health org. She told me they told her that she needs to see a psychiatrist but it costs a lot for one session. Shes telling me that she's fine but I don't think so. I want her to go but she won't because she dosent want to out the financial pressure on her family. Can she be forced to go? Or is it her and her family's decision?
If it's a government program then it should be free. Well that's what it's like in QLD. The state government can force you to see a professional if you're at serious and immediate risk of yourself and/or others.
Nope
Yes.
Jump - you will lose weight. At the apex of the jump you will in fact lose all weight and be perfectly weightelss. Of course, you'll gain it all back when you land :-)
sdfads
Your not alone there are many others that feel the same way as you do . For me I take things 1 day at a time I don't know any easy answers no fairy will wave a magic wand an fix things, if there is such a thing send it my way next. Try and smile
Things are going to get better even if they seem hopeless. For example, I have a relative who was sentenced to life in prison even if he was innocent. But he stayed strong and after 14 years, he was released because the witness recanted. Another example is Mandela who spent around 30 years in prison. He stayed strong and he was finally released and managed to become president of his country and did a lot of good..There was a time, I felt hopeless and miserable, now I am quite happy.
I feel like an alien from another planet who was sent here to observe. Because really, I feel I do not belong here either. That my alien intelligence was planted into this body in the womb and when I kick it, my intelligence will go home. In the mean time, the crazy people here amuse me to no end with the stupid crap they do. By taking the world with amusement I can cope with it..
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
No way to do that with anything- there is no medicine that makes a penis bigger.
All men do, but you get what you get. Nothing you do can increase the size of your penis permanently.
LOL. Without medicine? My b/f didn't know that one! healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-e...

A good diet while pregnant will only help make your baby healthy. Looks are determined by the parents and genetics. So make sure the mother is attractive !
Food will not help. You need to carefully select your baby's ancestors.
Eat lots of vegetables.
your babies appearance is dictated by you and your partners genetics and not food.
RICE & beans.
Hey, first of all let's get this straight you're 11 and handsome ! You were created the way you are for that very reason. As you age and mature you will began to feel weird changes but hey, it's apart of life. You are just developing and it's okay to feel sad at first but never forget that you are handsome just the way you are ! Puberty will come and go and you'll be back to your happy self in no time ! xoxo, hope I helped a little :)
It's because you are chubby. Now, get off the computer and talk this over with your parents. Maybe sign up for some activities like bowling, baseball or whatever sport interests you. If nothing does, then try to go bicycle riding or skate boarding. But don't go crazy and start up some kind of diet without talking to your doctor first.
It more to do with diet, genetics - and depending on your circumstances - level of fitness. Puberty can often shift weight around quite a lot, and seemingly put it in strange places as your body adjusts itself to prepare for the changes brought on by hormones. How you begin puberty can be very different to how you look when you finish. That part isn't in your control, but keeping fit, eating well, sleeping properly, etc. are factors where you can have a large say in the matter.
Oh yeah. You're only 11. You likely haven't hit your growth spurt yet. You'll get taller and your weight will even out. If it bothers you that much, start exercising or get into sports to help you stay active.
It's puberty, don't worry
go bicycle riding everyday or jogging
Birth control. Read those words over and over.. If you don't plan on exercising any sort of birth control, how do you think you're going to CONTROL whether or not you get pregnant???????? Condoms are a form a birth control...
Different types of pills often help with your sexual desire. Talk to to your doctor. Otherwise a copper IUD has no hormones and usually doesn't cause your issue. A lot of people swear by pulling out (some guys "leak" and this is not an option) and or using the calendar method (no sex during ovulation week, hard because you will want to), however these methods also have the highest failure rates, particularity with certain people, so be mindful of that.
There are dozens of methods of birth control: pills, condoms, IUD, sponge, diaphram. But if you use NO birth control you will get pregnant.
:D :D :D Birth control is by definition controlling pregnancy. Anything you do to prevent (or maximize the probability of) conception is birth control.
Yes. Abstanence.
You should drink 100 oz water/day, get your heart rate up to about 125 (faster won't do you any good) for 35 min twice/day (longer won't do you any good), eat green vegetables. Here's something that might help, if you care to read it: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/20...
Hey! So I have something to say. No matter what you're perfect. Although, if you really want some tips then I'll tell you some. However, at this age remember that you're still growing. Try a "five minute abs" video. It doesn't work within five minutes but if you do it repeatedly that might help. Watch what you eat. Try not to have late night snacks. Hope this helped. Good luck!
Cut out sugar and processed foods (even ones that pretend to be healthy, like low-fat yogurt and cereal bars) Eat eggs, meat, vegetables, and full-fat dairy. Your body needs fat. Fat does not make you fat (myth busted!) sugar and excess carbohydrates do. Stress also has a role in weight loss. If you are stressed, it is harder to lose weight. Try not to obsess over it. I found that keeping a food diary helped to lose weight. I could put what I was eating down on paper. Kind of like Dumbledore and his pensieve, it helped to get it out of my head.
Run daily. When parents buy healthy food, eat it graciously. Have a backup plan for parties and holiday feasts. Practice being happy.
Start riding a bike or walking/running, take up a organizes sport you might enjoy
I'm really tired and sick of the tireless bullshit, I need a quick and quiet solution to a problem, one that's painless, non burdening, won't cause a mess or disturbance, something that will put me out like a light, I just wanna go, nobody would miss me, people die everyday, every second, some feel pain, some don't, I just wanna go without a sound without disturbance, without incident.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
You are solely responsible for your present poor and weak mental health. You should not have been careless and negligent about your mental health which is vital. I suggest that you consult a professionally qualified doctor and always try to maintain perfect mental health conditions in future to avoid such pitfalls in life.
You need to press 9 1 1 on your phone right now and tell them you want to stop being a bother to other people. Please. I don't know you but you are worth having around. Please get some help.
Sorry, it's actually illegal to answer your question. Call a crisis hotline instead ASAP.
Go to counselling

The wax is very close to what the apple makes itself. It's healthy to eat the skin of the apple, it has some nutrients plus fiber. Half a gram of wax won't hurt you.
Just wash it. And that minuscule amount of wax is not going to harm you at all. You'd be surprised how many other foods contain different types of Wax. There's no harm in it bro.
IN our house we peel of the apple skin and eat to avoid intake of any wax.Even if it is safe it is definitely a chemical which is always not good for consumption. Regards.
Buy Organic!
It's usually just beeswax, which is perfectly safe
Wash any fruit in clean water. < M
No problem either way.
I'm with Isaac. Your penis is just another part of your body and you shouldn't be ashamed to talk about it with your parents since it's a medical issue. Tell your dad, "Hey, Dad. My foreskin is really tight and it causes me pain and I'd like to see a urologist to see if there is anything I can do about it." If he counters with, "But I'm not circumcised and I'm fine," then just remind him that everyone is different. And, unfortunately, not being circumcised doesn't work for you. There might be other solutions the urologist recommends.
After a lot more research. Circumcision is not reversible. < M
Just ask them to make an appointment with a urologist.
For most people, monthly replacement lenses are the best choice. There are great lenses available. The price is reasonable. I like one day lenses for people who only wear lenses once in a while, have problems with monthly lenses or place a very high value on convenience.
I know the one day contacts better than others Bcs you must change every day and less chances of getting bacteria on it. But the 2 week also good and cheaper just always clean them and don't fall a sleep with them. About the brand you should test several Bcs each brand suit each person diffrently
I personally have never used 1-day contacts. I have the 2-week ones. I think that they would be better, as you don't have to buy as many. Instead of buying 30 pairs of contacts to last you a month, you only need to buy two pairs. As far as brand, I use Acuvue Oasys, and I love them. They're very soft, easy to take care of, and don't dry out too fast. :)
WORE MONTHLIES THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE GOT DAILIES, THEY ARE MUCH BETTER, DO NOT LOOK AT PRICE, YOUR EYE HEALTH IS ALL THAT MATTERS HUN. I RECOMMEND DAILIES.
Belly fat is difficult. My recommendation would be to change up your workout routines. If at all possible start a weight lifting/strength training program at a gym and get some instruction from the gym trainer. But you can also start a program at home using household objects for weights and also by doing exercises that use your own body weight - push ups, squats, lunges, dips, planks, crunches, etc. Use google to your advantage and learn about these exercises. It will work.
It sounds fairly good, but you may need more variety to make sure you are getting all your nutrients. Eating this kind of food might make your belly poof a bit, because healthy food actually takes a little more space than junk food for the same amount of calories. You probably notice it more than anyone else, though. Our culture teaches us to be too tuned in to what we think are "flaws" in our body. You should watch this documentary: "America the Beautiful" and its sequel. Its a real eye opener.
I called the customer service number, I spoke to Andera. She was very informative and detailed about Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea , and several other of their products. She was very polite and pleasant to talk to. I received great customer service. Just give it some time to work, you will feel better and loose fat and weight in the process .
Maybe cut some of the rice and watch the sugars in jellies, dressings, & kombucha juice.
Get some excercise
There is no danger to be aware of. Plenty of males have masturbated or had sex "whilst sitting upright with back straight on the edge of the sofa". As you continue to post this rubbish without any evidence to support your claim, it only demonstrates that you have some unhealthy fixation with masturbation and sofas. Present your evidence and vindicate yourself. I have only ask you to do this umpteen times, yet you NEVER do. Spoilers... it's because you haven't any evidence.
On this site we have you and the sofa, Melanie/Kylie who gets her hair caught in her handcuffs and him with the rubber glove fetish. I suggest you invite them around to your house where you can all wear rubber gloves and handcuffs and sit on your sofa, and talk about your perverted posts and dam well get off here. Its boring for the rest of us. Year after year after year.
There is no danger. What you described only happens to an extremely tiny portion of people.
So unlikely in the grand scheme of things as this is a pretty unlikely position to be in.
A Better question would be, why does this question have to be asked 15 times?
Need to take a class on physiology and you would know your theory is incorrect.
thats a good myth
Not again
you again? i thought your mother threw you out, didn't get that job did you?
No. A degree in counseling requires little math, and depending on the school, it may not require any math beyond what you had in high school.
No not really. You need to be in communication and mental health. I would suggest going to school for these.
No you don't need high level math for that
no, but you should at least get passing grades.
no you don't
At school, burritos are sold in their plastic wrappers (pre-heated), and I pretty much ate one every day last year and have had plenty this year. I'm concerned, though, about the plastic part. Even if plastic is marked as microwave-safe, isn't it still bad to eat that much food that has been cooked inside of plastic? I'm scared that this could potentially do damage. For one, I won't be eating them anymore; however, I have eaten them plenty in the last year+. Is this threatening? I know that exposures to certain plastic materials can even go as far as causing cancer... which scares the heck outta me.
Take the plastic off before you microwave the burrito! You're not supposed to eat the plastic, silly.
No of course not! If you were to cook something that was NOT microwave safe than you'd be in big trouble. No they will not do you any damage accept you will get fat. Burritos aren't very healthy.
It is perfectly safe. Just don't eat the plastic. Not that it will cause cancer, but it has even less nutritional value than the burritos.
well your supposed to take the plastic off and throw it away and than heat it and than eat it and you'll be fine
for mental health don't take stress.do all type of that things which keep you happy.eat healthy things which you like.when you happy then your mind will also feel relax and you will be mentally healthy .
Value yourself Take care of your body Surround yourself with honest family and friends Avoid drugs and other un healthy things

A woman doesn't get pregnant from "precum". Over 98% of the time, it does not contain sperm cells. A man ALWAYS secretes "precum" from the tip of his penis when he is sexually aroused. It is nothing more than lubrication in anticipation of intercourse. A woman gets pregnant when a man puts his naked penis inside her vagina and ejaculates sperm cells inside her. If you didn't do that, then she couldn't have gotten pregnant.
Possibly
If you don't know how something works, don't mess with it. You're clearly children. Enjoy your childhood. It'll be over before you know it and there is no going back.
why you EVER assume it is okay to have unprotected sex if you're worried about getting pregnant
You sound like you have an acute case of adolescence. What you are describing sounds nothing like breast cancer and the risk of breast cancer at your age is statistically ZERO. It does sound like a common reaction to hormone fluctuations of puberty. Average age for breast cancer is 62 with 80% of people diagnosed over the age of 50.
Not even remotely close to even being considered breast cancer in any way shape or form. At 14 years old, you are more apt to have tea with the queen herself. Speak to your parents, and no you can't go to the doctor yourself you need insurance.
none of that has anything to do with breast cancer, kid. This is all lack of knowledge on your part as to the symptoms of b. cancer. Your symptoms are from boob growth and puberty. And no, at 14 you can't go to a doctor by yourself.
No, you don't have breast cancer. You have hypochondria.
than see a doctor
@Asdzani: Excuse me, Mrs. Pretentious, I don't believe I ever said that I obsess over people's bowel movements either. I was merely asking a question. When TV shows and people poke fun or notice a toddler drinking maybe four glasses of water before bed that they may wet the bed, or the poke fun at the stereotype of Mexican food may causing someone gas, do you also think these shows and people are obsessing over people's bowel movements as well? So sick of pompous people ruining the fun here.
No, I don't think about that because I normally eat meat with every meal, and I don't get constipated as a result.
No. That's not what happens so that's not what I think.
Nope I don't care
Other people's bowel movements are not my business. I don't go around obsessing about other people's poop. Why do you?
I don't pay much attention what other people eat....
No, but if the meal if entirely made up cheese, I feel for them.
Girl. I'm 16 and I get so lazy with shaving. Especially in the winter. Legs- I shave like every 3-7 days. Underarms- every day or every other day. Vag- once a week or more when I have to go to the beach or something. Also sometimes I totally let myself go and don't do anything for a week or more. It gets tiring. The more you shave the coarser your hair gets.
Shave where? Legs? Underarms? Pubic region?
You shouldn't shave your pubic hair at all!
Daily. Each morning.
yes, unless it's a dalai llama.
Llamas mostly just spit which I why I don't like them. They have a major attitude problem. ;)
Anything can kill you. From a single atom to a serial killer. If the lama really hated you why wouldn't it attack you and trample and kill you or something.
Nah. Llamas are babies.
Dumb ways to die, So many dumb ways to die-ie.

I have no butt it's basically flat. Sometimes people comment on how flat it is and I'm getting self concious about it. I'm only fourteen and you might think I'm too young to worry about it but it's really getting to me. So please just a few suggestions on how to get my butt at least a little bigger. Oh and one thing, no matter how many squats and lunges I do those target legs more than butt I need help on butt.
Add weights and more reps to your leg/butt workouts. Switch them up don't do plain squats all the time-there are curtsy squats, sumo squats, squat jumps, plié squats, side lunges, Bulgarian split squats.
Google butt exercises
Squats, research deadlifts
The best exercises are squats and lunges
Squats. Lots of them.
Hey, I'm 11 and im a boy. when I masturbate after a while I start to feel so good then it feels so good that it feels like something is pushing out of it but when i look nothing is there it hurts a teeny weeny bit is it because theres no sperm inside me and its trying to push it out but nothings there? thats what I think but I want someone to confirm.
One's you enter puberty, youll surely be able to ejaculate it, your body start to produce semen and thats why puberty in male is one of the best part of life. For now, it doesnt produce semen but sooner or later youll have that.
Sounds like a dry ejaculation. Maybe, you should wait a bit longer.
An 8 inch penis is not only big but impossible for anyone. The average adult size is about 5.5 inches. Get yourself a better measuring tape and also ignore any overhang of foreskin as that is not counted in a proper penis measurement.
I believe that question can not physically happened when I was 14 and I had a average penis and im 16=/17 next month and I have an 8.5in cock right now and if u do want a 8.5 in cock with 16 what do was im black first of all, and I ate lots of vegetables and fruits im telling u eating healthy is key because it makes your key bigger and most girls enjoyed large cocks(telling from experience).
Pretty good size for anyone 13 or any age
Yes it is huge. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches.
Good. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Amazing ! lol, Im a guy yet this just turned me on. Im 14
I think its a Star Wars light sabre. < M
yes
Take math again.
Pretty long, buddy.
Everything about 9/11 was one big lie. There is the oft-thrown around 3,000 victim number as well. How do we even know the real death toll? They doctored the photos of many alleged "victims" from other sources. Tania Head was a supposed survivor, and turned out to be a huge fraud. 9/11 may have been the most elaborate hoax ever pulled. ~Aizen
Which 9/11 victims are you talking about? There are thousands of them.
What does a landline phone sound like?
That's just one of many unanswered questions about 9/11, but in the interests of staying out of a secret government prison I'll just let it go at that.

Yeah technically you can't. Threesome are more of a 1 woman multiple man thing.
Lots of things-- the guy can be receiving oral from one while giving oral to the other. Or both girls could be orally stimulating the guy. All kinds of fun things- including girl on girl action too.
They're overrated, do 2 guys 1 girl it's better
If you have two girls willing to do this then there won't be any problems figuring out what to do. Things will take care of themselves.

Google a Dr. S. Burzunski in Texas. For the 5th time the medical establishment is trying to take away his license to practice. Why? Because for the past 30 years, he's been curing cancer without using drugs. The problem is big profits can't be made from using anything natural. So the medical establishment says that you can only use what they sell. Curcumin kill cancer cells without harming good cells. Stage 4 does not have to be a death sentence. But if you think that only traditional mediciine can be used. then Stage 4 is a deat semtence. sentence.
Chemo or radiotherapy and which type of cancer?
There are many types. Try asking an actual question.
which type of cancer ??? skin kidney or blood???
depends on what type it is
Although it's much better to take care of the symptoms instaed of masking them, frequent washing with water will ikely help. BV can be an STD, also. Websites and healh professionals may say otherwise, but it still may be. Also, unscented antiliners should help.
Pantiliners Vagisil cream
Yeah, wash and change underwear a lot. You can also try baby powder or stuff made for feminine odor. I think there are powders and sprays at the store near the pads.
Take a shower in the morning, and use panty liners. Also putting perfume around your hips might help.
just do it yourself, http://www.earthclinic.com/cures/hydroge... simply said, douche with 50% water/50% hydrogen peroxide....you should always learn how to fix stuff on your own.....saves time and money and increases your confidence in what you can do....you need to watch your diet....drinking kefir helps too....baking soda comes in handy and an apple cider vinegar douche/diluted after the peroxide....if your regular doc was a naturopath, you'd already know this stuff....
Use any Toronto Maple Leaf fan....(a douche)
Absolutely. Why? Because the 3 strongest determinants of height are genetic potential, nutrition and exercise. Whose genetic potential? Your parents. Which parent? Both of them or to be more correct "all of them." What does that mean? Your parents, their parents and so on ect. Are genes sexist? No. At least not in this particular instance... Are there other determinants of height? Yes. Environmental concerns & disease but let's assume you don't live near a toxic waste dump and mom didn't do naughty things while pregnant.
It depends on the genes they get, but yes, it's possible. They also need to be sure to eat healthy, not smoke anything, get lots of rest, and exercise. Those also influence height.
Yes
Without knowing what it is there is no way to gauge the danger to her health. The most excruciating pain I ever experienced was caused by gall stones. Kidney stones also cause excruciating pain. Neither are life threatening.
Sure, it is dangerous for anyone. If could be an appendicitis, gallstones, a hernia or one of a dozen or more other issues, including a mild sprain.
If you are a teen under 18 then yeah, that is considered child porn. Plus once you put it on an electronic format, your penis pic can be sent anywhere to anyone.
Since you are a minor, yes. Thats highly illegal! Thats distribution of ChildPorn. Good luck with the legal system kid.
Its a bit wired... Why didnt u just get a girlfriend
it's not bad as long as you only sent it too her
It's illegal. Don't y'be no fool, hear?
is she a certified pec ker checker ?
The internet is forever.
As long as you know you are not pregnant! lmao. Well, believe it or not, abnormal, well I should say, not consecutive cycles are totally normal. It has been about 8 months no, right? I personally don't see a gynecologist, but my health care doctor also studies women's health therefore, she is able to do all that an OBGYN can do. Honestly, don't be afraid to tell your mom about this problem, she may have had the same issue around your age or in the past, she will definitely help you out with finding the right doctor and the answer, I wish you luck.
If your insurance no longer covers a GYN specialist, then just go to your regular family doctor. He can diagnose and treat your problem just as easily as a GYN can. Your insurance will cover a visit to your family doctor, with no questions asked. Insurance companies are sometimes hesitant to cover a visit to a specialist UNLESS you have been referred to a specialist by your family doctor.

Breast cancer is nothing like a pimple. You have a nasty zit or possibly a small sebaceous cyst. Both of these are minor skin conditions and nothing to do with breast cancer.
Sounds like a boil. Doesn't sound like breast cancer.
Nope. Doesn't sound like it at all. Sounds more like an inflamed pimple. See your doctor. He can put your mind at ease in minutes.
Haha it is most likely not cancer. It's probably just a cyst, which are all the things you described. Probably from sweat or your bra. Go to the dermatologist.
I think it is just a red inflamed pimple. BUT just to be safe see a doctor.
Nope. You probably have a pimple.
I dont think so,but you have to go to hospital now.
It's not bad, but depending on your age you may be going through a teenage phase in experimenting with your sexuality - you can grow out of this and be 'straight'. If, however, you've found that you've been attracted to girls before in the same way and you later still find boys attractive, then you're bi. Either way, none of these orientations are bad and we live in an era that's never been more tolerant and accepting of whoever you are. So don't worry.
It is not what you could label as "bad", but if you were completely straight you would not get an erection when looking at cute boys. While you may consider yourself as "straight" you may be bisexual. A straight guy would not get an erection when he sees cute guys. Also a straight guy in his mind would not necessarily label them as "cute", but rather as good looking or handsome.
Normal- most guys get turned by anything sexual, especially when they are in their teens. Just part of growing up. Hormones rage and fluctuate.
No it's not bad
-Only if the Cute Boys don't like Straight Ones. ;)
Not at all = but maybe not as straight as you think. < M
You're gay
you may be bi sexual
Don't get why so many guys your age think they have not started puberty when they are ejaculating or leaking precum, have normal erections and pubic hair. Probably started at least a year or so ago, before you grew pubes. Wet dreams are not common, only about 1/3 of all guys ever get one. Sounds like you are leaking precum when you masturbate, just need to learn to stimulate yourself correctly to ejaculate.
Youre on puberty dude, since youre growing pube hence called puberty, that clear fluid was your prec.um and was secreted because of it. Do it a little longer and you might ejaculate with white creamy, sticky fluid and thats semen. Wet dreams dont appear instantaneous like you want to, its involuntary, but sooner or later you will have those. Take it easy bro.
You are in puberty. The pubic hair is one of the first outward signs of puberty. Masturbation reduces or stops wet dreams so you may not experience them because your taking care of yourself properly. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
You're 14... you already started puberty smart one. And if you are ejaculating regularly by means of masturbation or sex then you won't have wet dreams.
And? healthy-relationship-dating.com/wet-dre...
what did the doctor who diagnosed the gynocomastia say?

Yes You Were Raped
Yes you were. I know it's scary and hard to deal with. I was raped when I was 11, I'm now 18. You need to tell your Mum, if not a teacher or another reliable adult. This person is dangerous, if he can do it once he can do it again. He needs to be locked up where he can't hurt anyone. And if you are feeling guilt or sadness or scared ect talking to people or going to counseling is a good idea. Best luck x
Yes, tell her NOW! my friend's sister (she was 8 when she was raped but is now 23) was raped like you were but the case was dropped because of how long ago it was. Have her call the police now and get someone over to help you and make sure he doesn't come back as well go arrest him.
Yes, it was rape. Based on the question you are asking, seems like it was against your will and the actions described, you were. Do not be afraid of telling your mom. Tell her, it doesn't matter if she sees him as son. You are her daughter and if you tell her everything, she will believe you. Also, stay away from him and see if you can file a report. You shouldn't let this pass by as nothing especially if he said that he would be back.
Don't ever be afraid to tell a parent hun!!! I am a criminal justice major if your mom won't listen to you tell the officer at your school if you have one if not tell a counselor that guy needs to be in jail for raping you!!!! If you don't say anything he will continue to keep doing it and that's not right at all!!!! What a jerk! And if no one will listen or do anything at your school go to a local sub station and file a report an officer will listen to you and have him taken care of!!!!! Hope you get some help sweetie keep me updated ok!!!
If you didn't want the sex it's rape. Even if you did and he did so without you consenting, rape. Tell your mom but don't freak out about it because that could lead her to believe you are lying. Unfortunately our society is super victim-blaming when it comes to this subject but i'd still give it a shot.
I'd suggest going online and editing your question to remove your name. Could be embarrassing if someone you know reads about your concerns about a small penis. As to smell, that may be that you simply need to cleanse the penis and scrotum more often. Did not say your size but most guys reach full adult size by 15, and average is 5.16 inches.
Genetics. And since boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16... It looks like you may have topped out there. And exercise proper hygiene. You have to wash your penis with warm soapy water just like you do the rest your body.
Don't smell... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Average 5.16in. Wash your stuff. No one cares what your name is I'd edit it out if I was you
Pubic hair might be the cause of the smell. It can sometimes be potent and very unattractive to girls. consider shaving and see if it helps, also as said above , wash frequently.
Genetics for the first. Wash it daily, if not twice a day. Wear cotton boxers/undies, not synthetic. Sleep nude. Lastly, check how much crap is in your diet.
Wash it good
eww

On my last visit to my doctor, I received a perscription for birth control pills, and would like to get them without my parents knowing. I'm 18, so I must have more options, but I am on their insurance plan so I'm not sure what to do. I am not telling them, that's out of the question, they're not cool hip parents and would not be okay with knowing that I could possibly be having sex.
You can go and pay cash (or use your own credit card or whatever). Easy peasy. Or you can call your insurer and ask that any correspondence about *your* medical care be directed only to you. This is your right as an adult, even if you are covered by your parents insurance.
You'll likely have to pay for them yourself then. You might be able to take the prescription to a Planned Parenthood type place and see if they can provide them but I am not sure about that.
Don't use your parents' insurance. Pay for the doctor visit and for having the prescription filled yourself.
well ull have to pay for them yourself and ask the pharmacist about not calling ur home
Probably. And im not talking about the kind you eat with butter and old bay seasoning either
Yep You'll soon have blisters,crawlers and tings.
Thus question smells like troll all over it.
i know it sounds silly, but ask a doctor to look at it, they would know what to do, honestly
Low blood pressure can cause headaches, lightheadedness, and fainting from just sitting or standing up It can be caused be dehydration or poor diet. Make sure you go to the doctor to get a proper diagnosis and drink tons of water
Seizures don't present the same as passing out same with strokes. But there may just be something wrong with your brain (damaged section,tumor) it wouldn't be a hemmorage or hematoma or you wouldn't be here by now .
see an hio method chiropractor. postural hypotension is usually due to adrenal insufficiency from nerve interference.
No. You need to cut back on healthy carbs and cut out simple carbs altogether.

Whenever she wants. There are no rules about this. Girls start developing breasts at different ages.
I don't believe in wearing a bra at a particular age, or even on a regular basis. The only time I feel the need for it is a sports bra to do aerobics at the gym.
No specific age. When she starts developing breasts she should look into wearing a bra.
whatever age they happen to be when their breasts need support. there are 12 year olds that could fit in a D cup and 15 year olds that are still not developed. age has nothing to do with it
The age when their breasts are starting to develop
14+ years old
Whatever age their boobs need one.
When she has actual breasts.
I'm 18 and about to leave college after 2 years of A levels. Staying at school to do my A levels was one of my biggest regrets in life, I have hated it. The subjects I am doing are pointless and I know they're irrelevant in life. Anyway, now that I'm about to leave I have no idea what to do. I'm not going uni like everyone else, and I have no interests. I currently have a part time job, but it's not something that I would want to do for the rest of my life. What should I do? How can I find out what I want from life? Thanks.
The best thing I ever did was get a working holiday visa to Australia. I spent a year living in hostels, working on fruit farms, in bars and driving a minibus and I learn so much about myself as well as having the time of my life. I scuba dived, sky dived, quad biked, went pot holing and hiking in the wilderness. I came home knowing what I wanted to do with my life and lot more mature.
Go to the nearest community college and find their courses and professions. It could be that something they have at a different level may attract you. Good luck.

Sounds like you're lacking in the protein area. Try eating other things that protein in it other than your shake. Make sure you drink plenty of water and eat lots of fruits and veggies!
stop with the stupid protein shakes and eat real food - you should be drinking lots of water after exercise
yes, the protein helps your muscles grow and gives you energy
yes
That is placebo effect.
You will know soon. You guys typically top out around 18 or 19. There's no possible way anyone on here to know what your height is going to be. So don't ask.
Nope. Just a wild guess for anyone to say how tall you will be. Most guys are within 2 inches plus or minus of their dad.
176cm. Men stop round 16.
That might be it. I'm that too, tall, and hit it at the same age as yourself. No one can say for sure; it's down to genetics.
no
Satisfaction is not the same for any two people. The orgasm isn't the end all be all of sex. It is about mutual pleasure. For some people, an orgasm might mean satisfaction. For another person, it might simply involve feeling pleasure.
Euphoric
Feeling happy, content and relaxed
her satisifaction is knowing her partner shot his lo ad
I'm only 13 and the head of my penis last night was sticky and shiny. I do masterbate and normally just wipe with toilet paper. I think its just moisture, hopefully not a yeast infection. Before I went to bed last night I took off my tight underwear and wore shorts instead. Now this morning its still a little sticky but not as sticky. Please help.
Wet dream. If the 'sticky' is clear and scentless, that is pre-c*m fluid aka Mother Nature's lube. Actual semen won't be far behind.
You do wash your penis very well right... everyday with warm soapy water? Hygiene is everything bro.
Take a shower
Likely just oozing some precum.
im a man in my late 30s, i have borderline personality disorder, i have been bullied in my past...and i used to have rage outbursts in the street...which caused me to get physically attacked. one time, i remember i had an anger outburst in the street...years ago....and some muslim pakistani lad shouted threats at me.......he said ' he would put me in a body bag and put me in the ground ' that panicked me and i ran away? it give me a scare that incident.....could it be because of ptsd?
Verbal threats frightened you away because they caused a reaction in your parasympathetic nervous system known as fight-or-flight response. The first interaction triggered a fight response and the second one triggered a flight one. The data collected by your senses is interpreted by a very primitive part of the brain near the brain stem. Running was actually probably a very good idea and it kept you alive. When there is acute neurological damage to the brain this system stops working. When that happens you would not have nearly gotten in the first fight and you would not have ran from the second one. It would be a tragic thing if there was some damage to this area of the brain.
So you got angry with someone for no reason yet you can't see that he had the right to get angry in return. As you've previously made xenophobic and racist comments on this site as well as inciting racial hatred I expect that your unprovoked attack was of this nature. You don't have PTSD you just have a sense of entitlement and start whinging like a little girl when people stand up to you. You're a grown man who needs to drop the victim complex and accept responsibility for your behaviour. Try being pleasant to people, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
Very possibly however what you have to remember is that a mental health illness is not an excuse not take responsibility for your actions
No. Obviously you're not treating your borderline PD, because you should know that you don't react normally to things.
I have really thick thighs, I mean im overweight but I weigh 230 pounds and everyone, even my doctor tells me I look between 180-190, also I lose weight pretty fast, I was in a football endurance club and in boxing, and even though I still ate junk food and didn't watch my diet I was losing about 5 pounds a week (if I exercise)... could it be because I have really muscular legs and thighs, and I heard the using the muscle groups in your legs burn the most calories
If you're looking for a great boost of energy without getting the jitters or feeling like you're consumed with potentially harming and dangerous chemicals, this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea product is great for you. The energy came in a harmless swoop, and I didn't feel like I was full of harmful chemicals .
Probably I can leg press over 800 pounds
The more muscle you have, the more calories your body burns at rest.
That's just sweat, no way to prevent that if you are exercising. Some women, and guys too, find it attractive.
The smell comes from bacteria eating the oil in the sweat. It is easiest to use a aerosol deodorant for chest and back. If you get an anti persperant, it decreases sweat too. I would be careful to not wear too strong smelling one since you have to spray it over a larger area than just the underarm. Also, make sure you have your underwear on. This will burn down below if you get any down there.
Just use a deodorant soap when you shower, that should take care of that problem.
It's just sweat, so take a shower after you workout, if you want to smell better.
"Demons". Is she having hallucinations, where she actually feels like a demon is touching her? If so, schizophrenia. if not, if she is just paranoid that they will, she could have paranoid personality disorder, or schizotypal personality disorder. The self-harming is very concerning, and does not necessarily relate to the other two disorders I listed above. Did something happen when she was 12? Trauma? Either way, she needs to see a therapist/psychiatrist desperately
Honestly, it could be anything. Hallucinations lead me to believe she could have some form of schizophrenia, maybe even psychosis but I doubt it. You need to get her to a hospital as soon as possible. Not to mention.. if she's been cutting since she was 12 why hasn't anybody helped her?
Some may say that seeing "demons" is leading to madhouse , in middle ages would also consider burning her on bonfire.But let`s be real , it is real problem.It is not the problem that she sees demons , demons also sees her.It is also the problem because no one can understand her(except me and minority of people) and that would lead that she might start thinking that she is mad and maybe commit suicide(which is demons work). If you don`t believe what she sees , you can`t help her. Take her to a priest.
It could be schizophrenia... she is at the right age to develop it.... but it could also be depression... severe depression can include psychosis. Get her to see a doctor and if she won't but you are worried she may attempt suicide then don't hesitate to call the police and have her committed.
It takes an average of 5 trips before rehab takes. As an addict/alcoholic, he can be serious now and in an hour, his mind could change and then in another hour, change again. He also can be totally out of touch with what he really feels, thinks, believes. Ones own mind screws with one, part of the physiological part of the disease. it is a never ending cycle, even for those that do sober up, it is a life long battle.
it took me 5 years and 6 rehabs to finally get it... i'm 9 months sober now,,, but like i said it took me 5 years... at least he's trying
You don't know for sure. You have to accept that he is trying, and while he is trying you have to support him. He has an illness that is very difficult to shake. The fact that he is trying is a good thing.
Always give him benefit of the doubt if he is seeking treatment. It is when he is not that there is trouble.
Plain water kills sperm. Just temperature changes do that. So does soap, etc. Guys may leak semen for an hour after ejaculation. But washes off easily from your gear and legs and abdomen, and in a pool the water IS chlorinated and just that alone would kill sperm-- but impossible for sperm to get into a girl without penis insertion. No girl has ever gotten pregnant in a pool or on a toilet seat or any way else other than getting penetrated.
Remember that sperm is a cell and sudden environmental changes may kill it within minutes. Its not the same temp as what we have in our body and not the same chemical substance that may protect it from dying.. Thats also explains why sperm count decreases in summers. She might get pregnant if she swims in a pool of semen.
The sperm would die in minutes if not seconds, outside of a warm environment. And no not ALL of it comes out
sperm die very quickly one ejaculated, any that are left in the urethra will be flushed out when you pee.
Shut up
You would probably benefit from talking with a therapist or even talking with a doctor about anti-depressants. But, at least try this: if you can, spend the next couple of weeks avoiding cruel or violent tv shows and video games, do some exercise (what you can), try to eat healthy, avoid eating a couple hours before bed time, listen to some chill music, spend time with people who don't stress you out, and try to engage in hobbies like painting, creative writing, hiking, etc. In other words, try to give your brain and body an extended period of relaxation. That might help you a lot. You could also look into things like yoga and mindfulness meditation.
don't smoke or eat any disorder thing which can harm to your health.do yoga and different exercises to keep you physically and mentally fit .don't take too much stress about your home problem.try to overcome from this.everyone has to face many problem after coming in this world and you are also the part of it.don't give up because it's not your life end.you know end means?it means efforts never die so always do struggle just like your mother.you will see your problem will solve soon.

IBS and IBD are two completely different conditions. Both cause symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and more, but they have different pathologies. IBD is an inflammatory disease, IBS is not known to be (we don't really know how IBS works- its symptoms are very real but we don't know the disease process that causes it).
Millions have IBS in the UK. Including me.
Most countries don't have any kind of healthcare. So it's never diagnosed. The people just live with it.
Americans eat crap food
my wife has it and some days are really bad for her

Don't worry. It is natural.

Hello so i am 19 years old male and for 1 week now, my bowel habits have changed. I have to go to the bathroom twice a day now. Whenever i finish it seems like that i haven’t completely emptied my bowel. No one in my family had colon cancer or problems with colon. Maybe it is something else? By the way i watch my diet and exercise 3 years. I drink ocassionaly and don't smoke.
You probably need more fiber in your diet - - - either from a better diet or a supplement like Metamucil. It would be quite unusual to have problems at your age.......however, I had bleeding polyps at 18. If you are worried about it . . . your pharmacy should have inexpensive "colon disease test" kits: a set of treated tissue strips that you simply drop into the commode after a bm - they turn colors if there is any trace of blood in your stool. . . . will reassure you with negative result or signal a trip to the doctor if positive.
19 yr olds don't have colon cancer.
Probably not, check your doctor
If there is not a corresponding change in your diet or lifestyle that could explain this and it continues for more than 2 weeks it is probably worth seeing your doctor for an explanation. It is unlikely to be anything major.
Doesn't sound like it. Sounds like you have a great diet. Others should be so lucky to go twice a day.
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product product is really a flagship for weight loss. There are not side effects and its really easy to take. I ended up losing 10 pounds in 2 weeks. which is pretty significant. I would recommend this product ot really anybody who wants to lose weight or wants to curb their appetite. The hardest part of this is to remember to take it at least 30 minutes before you eat .
It's not going to work if you don't exercise. I don't care what it says on the packaging, and diet which is capable of sustaining proper bodily homeostasis indefinitely (that is to say, are healthy) will do nothing for you if you do not exercise. A proper diet will reduce the accumulation of adipose tissue, but it wont consume it. You cannot be 'not the exercise type', you need exercise, this is a biological fact.
If you cut back too much, too fast, your body can go into "survival mode" and then you will burn fewer calories for exerting the same amount of effort. Better to figure out a common sense approach and do it gradually.
That will happen with any diet, especially if you don't exercise.
It's a disease and an illness. But you cannot catch it. It's not an infection or contagion. It's just cells which have lost the ability to switch off and die. They keep reproducing and form a tumour. About 1/2 of people will get cancer in their lifetime. But survival rates are better than ever and treatments are improving.
Cancer is a disease. You will most likely get it if it runs in your family but there are other causes as well.
It is a disease and illness but it is NOT contagious. You cannot catch it.Fewer than 10% are caused by inherited risk factors.
Both, a disease that sometime can be hereditary and will make you ill if you don't catch it soon enough.they have all kinds of treatments for it. Depending on what kind of cancer it is
Well it's both, isn't it?
Spicy isn't necessarily a bad thing. There aren't many calories or other nutrients in the components that make things "hot". Fried food, on the other hand, is generally a source of fats, oils, and carbohydrates well beyond what is needed.
Spicy food is not unhealthy. Fried food has a lot of saturated fat, which is not good for you. Large amount of carbohydrates are not good for you, particularly simple carbs. Pasta is basically a big plate of simple carbs. Try eating more vegetables.
Fried foods should be limntied. Thery are HIGH is saturated fdats, which clog yoru arteries. Many people think that spicy food is actualyl good for you.
Yes
yes, boiled doesn't use any oil
lmfao!
Weight Loss Green Store Tea product is the perfect detox and weight loss tea. It is safe, natural and 100% herbal. It helps burn fat, curb cravings, eliminate excess water, boost metabolism and detox your body from toxins. It tastes great too!
Scientists say of you eat less then you usually do then you will injure yourself so to stop eating is not the problem but after 6 o'clock in the afternoon you don't eat anything nor drink anything except water and in the morning start your day off with boiling water and mint to burn off the fat and cleanse the stomach
Cut out all sugar and grains. Eat full-fat dairy instead of low-fat (it's full of sugar, tastes gross, and doesn't keep you satiated for as long).
I feel like I wasted soo much time in my life, im 20 No drivers license, no College. I had a few issues with my past dealing with depression and anxiety. now I feel like everything is too late, my friends are graduating from college and im still thinking what I want to doo with life. I even let the most amazing girl goo because she was in College and had her car. I never asked her out because I have nothing to offer her. I hate my life sooo much......please help
Rather than hate find a way to move forward, see a counselor for assistance in figuring out what you want and what general things you can do while deciding. Not all high paying jobs require college, the world will always need plumbers, welders, and so forth so trade school may also be an option. If you have no disability to prevent driving I DO suggest you look for a driving school and work on getting a license. http://profoundlydisconnected.com/founda...
Bro! It's not too late. Maybe you should go to community college and get a job to save money for a car or learn to drive first. You'll probably be in your mid 20's by the time you graduate college. :) choose some career that seems easy but also one that interests you
I am 22 with no college. When I turned 19 I found a job. Gained as much experience in that job and was certified in everything I could then found a better job where I could apply these skills. Get a job and make LONG TERM goals. Never be satisfied with ok and make something of yourself because nobody else will make you successful. My friends who went to college are asking me for jobs now because of the hard work I have put in. Keep your head up and become someone. Become irreplaceable
it's cool. relax. you've got lots of time to build your life. ONE step at a time buddy. 1) Get a driver's license. Do whatever it takes, because guy....you gotta get around. 2) Get in shape: run EVERY day, and lift and get HOT. WORK that body or you're gonna get fat fat fat. that's no good. 3) Get in school: even ONE class is a start. You can do it. A community college will have tons and tons of people JUST LIKE YOU...people who are building a life! 4) Get a job. obvious. 5) If you do steps ONE through FOUR....you'll get a girlfriend. seriously. then you'll have it all: freedom, money, education, love. do it. RIGHT ******* NOW.
I'm 20, no college , no car plus dealing with depression and anxiety. I'm hanging in there , just hang on in there. Take time for you, study your driving theory.
Keep moving forward buddy. The only difference between me and you is that I have a license. It's not too late. It's never too late. One step at a time. Get your license and go from there.
I agree. Everybody cannot know the tricks to bribe other people (particularly doctors). Moreover "my doctor" will not prescribe any medicine without seeing the actual patient i.e. YOU. Hence, please follow some other simple and natural method in consultation with your Mentor. If you don't have a mentor then take guidance from your beloved parents. Later when you find time, please select a highly reliable, trustworthy and wise Mentor of your own choice from among your near and dear friends or relatives and in future strictly listen to his clarifications scrupulously. Elders and knowledgeable people say that illegitimate desire is the root cause for worries or anxieties. Avoid them.
You simply go in there and say "Doctor, I have been extremely anxious lately, and I can't seem to control it. I have heard a lot of good things about "Insert name here" (Xanax) etc. and was wondering if I can try a trial prescription to see if it would work for me, too." That's how my husband got his. Xanax, Lexapro, and Abilify.
You wont as they are addictive and stop working in a few weeks.
For the sanctity of their profession, let them determine that.
Any time your skin tans or burns, it's a sign that it has been damaged by the ultraviolet (UV) rays, which are produced by the sun and tanning beds. The change in color comes from something in your skin called melanin. It's what gives your skin its color. It's there to protect you. When your body senses your skin being damaged by the sun's rays, it produces more melanin to try and protect your skin from being damaged even more. This happens whether you have dark skin or light skin.
This damage can lead to skin cancer. The redness is caused by extra blood in the capillaries – if you press on sunburned skin it will turn white and then return to red as the capillaries refill. Sunburns are caused by the sun's UV rays – which do not feel warm.
At 44 years old you burn off little skin cancers from 1978 and 1979, '80, '81, '82, etc.
Did you diagnose him yourself? That's too bad because what you should do is let his doctor know that his medication isn't working.... but since YOU are his doctor I guess that's out of the question. Being "verbally aggressive" does not make him Bipolar....
My suggestion would be that you see a therapist for yourself as soon as that is possible. Maybe you can talk to a school counselor who can guide you to getting some help. You can fix your dad. The issue is taking care of yourself. It is not good to let other people drama you into their drama. Get help for yourself, then you can encourage your father to get the help he needs from a professional. Family dynamics are very difficult. Get help yourself and then encourage others to find help for themselves.
hate too say it but don't shout back at him or it will only make things worse and be there as support for both of them
there is no point in shouting back at him. just accept that this is how he takes out his anger

The medication on it has gone bad. Even if it not expired, it will not help. Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
My son used other treatment for six months with no results. And he changed to Ultra Organic ArganRain Oil Treatment and within two months his face more clear. You can use it safely, it is totally natural.
Yup not all things last forever
Its cause i urinated in the bottle
It is an anti feminist statement. Show that you reject feminism by wearing a bra.
lots of women sleep without it and usually dont wear them at home i guess they wear them out so their nipples wont show so i dont think its necessary to wear all the time
If you have boobs to fill it then it will support them and be good for your posture and stop them from sagging
Good if you're ratchet haha
Good.
It is GOOD.
how were you 21 in 2014, but only 22 in 2016.
We all have them in our necks under our arms in our groins, many of em in the body, generally they're not a problem, is there anything else they said about it?
Everybody has lymph nodes in the neck. They're supposed to be there. I'm afraid we'd need to know more than just that you have one.
You should go to the doctor if you are worried. Dont ask us because the only advice we can give you is go to a professional.

Usually it's only once, before our penis goes flaccid. A few rare man has discovered the secret to maintain n erection after an orgasm. We're not like women, you know.
Everyone is different but when I was late teen, early 20s, I could go 4 or 5 times over 2 or 3 hours not taking it out.
Men climax. Girls orgasm. But most males only climax once, ejaculate and then are done for 20-30 minutes. Some guys can have multiple climaxes and not ejaculate the 2nd or 3rd climax in one round since the semen has to be replenished.. Do it myself occasionally. A rare few guys can keep it up and keep going for another 10-20 minutes and ejaculate again when they climax the 2nd time but that's not common either. Bottom line- most guys are a one shot, one climax wonders.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme works good and I like how long it last.The results are great I can preform for hours and go multiple time without breaking a sweat or feeling tired it really get the job done this stuff is great.
A friend can have seven in 2 or 3 hours, but I know he is not average
Well it depends on the guy. Some guys are one shot and done and lose their erection while others can continue
Well, there are a few. Usually you'll feel good for a while about having given up sugar but slowly your body will start to crave it. And you'll also probably get headaches. The best solution to those is, if you're tempted, go for protein instead and drink lots of water. Some people also get sore joints, aches and pains, and flu-like symptoms. A few will even have 'the shakes' as their blood sugar levels drop.

It is not a good idea. Most drugs when mixed with alcohol can cause memory lapses and cause you to act out of character. For example, you would be dangerously intoxicated, and could end up committing a crime. You can also get seriously hurt.
Seriously? Drugs itself is already a bad idea dude. Of course mixing drugs and alcohol is an even more moronic idea. I met 3 people thatalready died from stupid ideas like that one. It's a classic ironic "what could possibly go wrong" kind of thing. But if you have to actualky ask that please go ahead and help humanity by removing yourself from it. You might even be nominated to the darwin award.
Usually people do this in the opposite order, given one's legal and one's not. As for being OK, depends on the mix. Alcohol is a depressant. When you take it with other depressants, that can be fatal. Many people who die from prescription drug overdoses are really dying from mixing booze and pills.
No don't do it , You'll end up shitting blood or worse , better off just stopping both the drugs and alcohol! peace and happiness to you!
No, it is a horrible idea.
You may want to try loose a couple pounds but 148 isn't very obese, just a little above average. If you crush sad you look good then girl, you are one lucky person :D
You're overweight. At 5'2", 148 is pushing the limit on how much weight your body can reasonably handle. Your target weight is only 115lbs, so you're 30lbs over what you should be.
yeah its okay but,you need to loose weight because when your become old you will have to face problem i would suggest you to join gym
No. You are fat. He's just being diplomatic. Unlike me.
if your happy and your boyfriend is happy than don't worry about it
Every time I have difficulty starting to urinate and when I actually start to urinate I can only urinate for about 3 seconds. Should I go to a doctor and get it checked out. I am worried about the expensive medical bills in the U.S. I drink almost the daily recomended amount of water a day I am male . I have not had intercourse nor have i used any drugs. Please help

Please help My age is 15. I do not understand how this could happen to me I consider my self a healthy person.
Difficulty in urinating can be one of several things. Depending on your age which you chose not to include. That would have been very helpful. If you're an adult it very likely you are experiencing prostate issues. Inflamed or swollen prostate causes difficulty in urinating. And is typically only treatable with antibiotics. Yes you need to see a doctor to find out what the problem is so it can be taken care of.
Whilst at 15 it is unlikely that you have prostate cancer, your prostate may still be a bit enlarged. However the problem may be related to an infection in your bladder. Only an examination by a doctor (preferably by a urologist) will determine the actual cause. Serious and permanent bladder and kidney problems may be caused if you cannot void your urine as you should. It is therefore imperative that you talk with your parents who will decide if and when to take you to the doctor as it would be them and not you paying any bills. Your genitourinary system is too important to leave things to chance, especially after 2 weeks of problems.
No reason it would make your penis stop growing. Or grow more. Just a sugary high caffeine drink.
No, it neither makes your penis stop growing or grow any bigger.
Does not make it stop growling
Oh geez.... another middle schooler listening to other brain dead middle schoolers... SMH

Ok so this might be a bit rude what I m a bout to say but. What is the average penis size for a 14 yr old? When I don t have a ***** it s about 2-3 inch but when I do it s about 8. I am only 160cm tall, so is my penis small or average or big. Don t give me any **** answers like " don t worry, shouldn t matter". Tell it to me straight thanks
The average erect (for a full grown male) is 5-6. You are above average AND possibly still growing. In short, you are not normal.
8 inches is very rare for an adult male, and way less than 1% of all men are 8 inches or more.
I take the Prolargent size product to increase my penis size when I need to be, and it works very well. Just take it when there's action and you'll be glad I did. Almost ripped the sheets.
Weird if you are 14 and really have 8 inches. Average is 4.2 inches erect. < M
so what you gonna do if some says that your ump of meat is too small isnt average or will be no good for doing anything with other than peeing..
No one goes from just 2 - 3" soft, to 8" hard.
You are completely normal. Your penis size is bigger than average so you have nothing to worry about regarding your penis.
Most likely physical fitness levels, the fitter you are, the less beats per minute your heart has to pump because it moves more blood in one pump. The 16 year old may be in better shape or it might have to do with increased hormone levels in the 16 year olds
The 16 year old is in better shape. Age has nothing to do with it.
Depends on physical conditioning

Getting a waist trainer is definitely not safe. It squishes your ribs and lungs which makes it harder to breathe. Some people already passed out from doing this. And no matter what you do you can't reduce fat in any particular are of the body. If you push the fat back it just goes right from where it was. If you want to lose weight safely and efficiently eat the right food and eat the right amounts of it. Ask your mom to apply you in your nearby gym. Jog on the treadmill for 30 mins and try out the other equipment. Try to be active at least 3 times a week. 70% of losing weight is actually diet. Goodluck!
There are reasons why women ceased wearing corsets. One of them was the damage it would do to the internal body. Also, I think I also read somewhere that women's bodies were permanently misshapen from decades of wearing a corset. Scary. I "trained" my waist by rating whole, real foods and being as active as possible. (The weather hasn't been condusive for walking, especially with a baby. Yet, I've still managed to lose a lot of the extra weigh, but I suppose breastfeeding helps, too.)
No, they aren't safe. If you want curves or a better shape, work at that by exercising.
They are most definitely not safe. They crush you inside and out, it's honestly not worth damaging your internal organs for 'curves'.
I was thrilled, over the moon. What were the odds, with all the available religions, that I would be born into a family that practiced the right one? Then I started asking questions, and actually considering the answers. It didn't take long from there. You've probably been down that path yourself. Obvious, glaring inconsistencies and impossible fairy tales do not hold up to the faintest scrutiny. I had a few months where I scrambled around looking at other religions, but once you learn to think rationally, ridiculous theological claims fall like dominoes.
The word brainwash implys that the brain was dirty before the washing. Now children don't need to be taught to misbehave and be brats! Now if we parents don't educate brainwash and indoctrinate children to respect and obey the law then hey your next stop is prison. So as a person who was properly brainwashed I say thank you parents because I'm not big brunnos butt buddy in prison. I've got a job my bills get paid I don't have people looking to kick my ****! So why complain? I've got what I need.
You sound like an idiot. How happy were you when you did not have a choice in school about being brainwashed with that filth they call evolution. You had no choice, in elementary school, in high school or at university, if you ever went to one - about studying according to the desires of atheists. Your arguments are moronic. How many atheists here are not former Christians!
This is a phenomenon that exists, but you can't assume that it's the case for every Christian. Most people do go through a period where they question it, after which some leave and some come back after a great deal of consideration.
There are millions of people that leave one religion for another every year so it's not about whatever religion you were brought up as, it's about what is true. Read about the first Muslim Miss America (2010), Rima Fakih, she just converted to the Catholic Church last month. People gravitate towards the truth or away from the truth. https://churchpop.com/2016/05/09/first-m...
"Brainwash" means not being allowed to have clear thoughts. I was an atheist and I resisted being drawn into any religion before I was influenced by good sermons and arts and I eventually decided as an adult to pursue Christian faith with clear conscience and open mind.
I wasn't brainwashed because I have control over myself and I read the Bible... saw both sides by going to public school the to Christian school and I believe that Jesus resurrected and I believe that he is the messiah.
I think we all finally question our parent's authority . And even though I still belong to the same religion my mom made me attend I now know that we all create out our own life before we are even conceived . But , you would have to believe most NDEers statements about the After-Life to agree with me .
As with any organ donation, there would be issues of tissue type and possible rejection. Having to take immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of one's life (and hence be at higher risk of infections) is not really worth it for the sake of a foreskin, which has no essential function. Secondly, being a cylinder, it would not fit properly unless you and he had exactly the same size penis. Thirdly after the many years that he has presumably been without a foreskin the blood vessels and nerves would not be available to be reconnected.
Rejection issues aside, there is insufficient blood supply for a foreskin to be grafted onto a circumcised penis.
Yes, but the nerves wouldn't connect properly.
Certainly that pathetic lying hag only has her own nest feathering interests at heart. LOL That's why. LOL

Probably a good mixture. The drowning would probably kill you before the bleach really had a chance to, but you'd certainly fill the effects of the bleach while you're drowning.
Definitely drowning would kill you faster the bleach. You can only last a few minutes without ventilation before you before hypoxic.
you need to have alot of bleach to drown someone.
probably a little of both
Ask them to pull you out of the house to a therapist. They can really help. Cognitive behavioral therapy is short term, about 8 sessions, and proven effective for anxiety and depression. It can get better. You just have to take the steps. Or you can sit there and complain about how unhappy you are.
Ask your parents if you can schedule a meeting with your doctor to talk about these things.
See a doctor, counselor, therapist.
get a baseball bat and make them understand.
They are completely different disorders. Schizophrenia involves psychosis. PTSD does not.
What's the difference between a steak and an orange? How about I just say that they have nothing in common except that they are both mental illnesses. They have different symptoms, different causes, different treatments...
Schizophrenia starts with "S" and PTSD starts with "P". It is good and I am lucky that you have NOT asked for the "differences" in plural. Asian guys are always intelligent guys.
Schizo is not caused by any event, though it could be, and makes someone jumpy and think everyone is against them. Prod is linked to a traumatic event and can be expressed in MANY different ways
Survival rates are pretty low. There's info at the link
People generally don't die of cancer. They die from the cancer treatments, which are slash, poison & burn. (surgery, chemo & radiation)
Very few
None
It's slave breeding. Fat storage around the hips is a sign of reproductive value. Like your dog with the extra floppy ears (and eyes that pop out of it's tiny, tiny head) we set up the situation for extra production of the crops. An ear of corn is naturally a tiny bitter seed pouch. But if you select the traits you want... It's offensive but true. I argue most things we see as offensive are truths we're not willing to admit we see.
A small number have implants. Some do work for it... but, generally, they don't work for it... it's just genetic. They are born with tissue and fat patterns that give them a big butt and little waist.
It's a natural body type, although some people do have implants put in.

If you have termial cancer then yes you dont have to do anything as you will die soon and if you had terminal cancer school or church or yahoo answers would be the last thing you would be thinking about!
1. Prudent to see a psychologist, but not a psychiatrist. 2. In the name of 'cancer fear psychosis' you must never spoil yourself. 3. Speak to your school counselor and be guided to live happily and live full 90+ years given by the God.
Your silly question is a slap in the face to those people who really DO have cancer and are fighting it in every way they know how.
Most children with terminal cancer long to be able to rejoin their friends at school and are too ill to have any interest in sex, drugs or cigarettes.
I have Leukemia on top of Rheumatoid Arthritis. & it weakens me considerably but I still keep going as much as I can. You can't keep feeling sorry for yourself. Find something you like doing & keep busy. I't'll take your mind off it. I'm in constant pain but I try to ignore it as much as possible.
If you have cancer you sure won't feel like doing much of anything..
if you're ill and feel able to do something then do it as you need to live. I wouldn't recommend drugs and alcohol though as it will not help with your illness.
Dependent on you.
No it is not OK.
I ve always been a bit forgetful, but lately it s been reaching dangerous heights. Once I forgot that I put a pot of water on to boil and I almost got burned when it boiled over. Sometimes at work I forget that a pan of bread has just come out of the oven (when I m the one who took it out) and I grab it and burn my hands. It s getting to the point where it s dangerous for me to be near heat or anything sharp in case I forget and hurt myself. I m only 20 years old.
It's best to call a doctor or get checked out, because small tasks like that are not linked with memory. More in common sense, It could be that you have a certain medical condition that causes you to do this. But I'm just assuming. It could just be a case of forgetful memory.
Try increasing your intake of fiber containing iron as well as whole grains containing folic acid. You can also try a folic acid supplement. If you eat a diet high in sugar and salt, cut back on both of those. You will find your memory approves. If your memory is causing yourself harm or you are in danger, you need to talk to a doctor, you may have early warning signs of a memory based illness
Dang, I can only imagine how bad it will be if you survive to be 60. You will probably forget how to breath before that though.
Blue balls is really just a sensation of fullness because when super horny your prostate and cowpers and other glands will produce seminal fluid in anticipation of ejaculation. Doesn't happen so the glands are full and ready for release. So when you later ejaculate, the semen is not really "fresh" in that it was already produced and so not surprising it is a bit watery. If you ejaculate into a glass, it will usually be clumpy. But after 30 minutes or so sitting there, it will get watery, and then get back clumpy and back to watery over a hour or so. Same thing you are experiencing.
LOL... no. Your testicles have nothing to do with the semen that is ejaculated from the prostate gland. And there is no such thing as blue balls. Any doctor will tell you that.
Maybe but what kind of gf doesn't finish you off? thats just messed up
it's normal, when you are excited your prostate produce liquid, and the more time you are excited the more liquid it produces...
One of the causes of Prostate cancer is harsh chemicals and food. I would like to have a big penis. I ordered Prolargentsize “herbal” capsule which make my penis bigger and increasing my penis size. It has no side effects. My blood circulation is perfect . My performance is perfect.
Hi well better than average at 5 inches and only 2 inches is required to get a woman pregnant.
It's just above adult average! Not small at all. I'm 28 but mine is only 4-4.5 inches erect!
Small is under 4.8 inches. Average is 5.16 inches. So quite large.
average but the bigger side of average, its a good dick, most people lie and say 7 this is BS, it however is not a big dick so its a good thing but not a great thing
it's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
it's fine for your age
oh yes yes very good good !!
Why ask me?
To follow up, had her seen by my neighbor who is a nurse and the bite is superficial and non threatening. Our pup is not yet old enough for the vaccine which is why she is unvaccinated and is kept inside and only let out to go to the bathroom, therefore there is logically almost no way she has contracted rabies. Thanks for everyone's input
If the pup had rabies, then you would've already known about it. The pup would've been acting strangely before it bit her. I wouldn't worry about it, but obviously take the precautions, put an antiseptic ointment on the skin, put a bandage on it, etc. If you want to take her to the doc, go ahead, but it's unlikely it's necessary. But do get the pup vaccinated as soon as possible.
Year
The puppy doesn't have rabies because it has not been in contact with a rabid animal. Work with your daughter to not be so rough.
Yes you should, just to be sure. And explain to your daughter that you should never play rough with a puppy.
Get it vaccinated and take her in
Should of done that right away
Maybe try watching tv or doing whatever works to get your attention off it. You can try exercise. Or you can see a doctor or nurse practitioner.
It depending on what you want to satisfy your need. Sex toys are always worth a try, you can always watch porn while you masturbate. I would say find a **** buddy.
try using a hair brush, markers, electric toothbrush, bananas, carrots, cucumbers, try find your moms dildo/vib when she is not home and have a great orgasm from that start having alot of sex ASAP. ask your close guy friends to start having sex with. you need it.
You should try to find out why. I'm not a cutter but, my daughter was. The question is... why ARE you? Being glad she found out would be great unless she is the reason or even understood it. I don't understand it. I found out why my daughter was self mutilating and, it hurt me a lot. But, I am sooo glad she told me... Just something to think about.
Your problem isn't that your Mom found out. Your problem is that you're doing this in the first place. And what you should do is knock it off.
Kill yourself? Why were you self harming in the first place. Just off with your head then. No but seriously, it looks like you guys have to have a serious talk. Just talk it out.
be glad she found out. ask her if she'll help you find a counsellor. I used to cut and it just sucks as a coping mechanism. don't indulge yourself in it. I know, it's hard, but it's not a good road to go down.
So i started wearing about 3 bras and a sports bra in able to make it seem like i have boobs, when in reality i barely have any. Now i have to wear all that anywhere i go, even when im excersizing or going out too the store, what do i do now. If i suddenly stop wearing all these bras people will start too notice. Im 16, and i dont wanna meet a guy that only loves me for my "boobs" and then if we start getting serious he'll eventually discover the real me. Please help me what should i do
Nah, feel free to drop the extra stuffing if you are tired of it. Plenty of girls "change style" from day to day. Next day they come with a completely different hair colour. That's really no problem. Also remember, if you have the really small boobs, that they will usually be much more elegant and nice in themselves than the "ordinary" ones. So once you have started thinking about how they be in an intimate situation, rather than how much they would be apparent for everybody through the blouse, then you are suddenly on top. I agree with Diana A's answer.
If I were you, I would switch up to a push up bra, or a padded bra like someone said. I can't imagine how you feel with wearing over like 3 bras a day! If things get even worse, then maybe (if you want and you are comfortable with), getting plastic (fake) breasts. Hope this helped!
If I were you I would slowly start cutting down on the amount you wear, or the type. For example if you wear 3 normal bras and a sports bra change it to 2 normal bras and 2 sports bras or 2 normal bras, a bralette and a sports bra. If you start cutting down people won't notice as much, they don't pay as much attention to your boobs as you think they do
Should be able to angle it upwards for vaginal penetration during missionary position. Would be odd if it did not raise upwards. Should work fine. Only difference with a downward pointing one, you have to manually insert for sex, while one that points upwards will generally slide right in the vagina if she is experienced and receptive. Way overthinking this whole thing. Once you penis is raised upwards and put in the vagina, will be same as any other penis. Though ar your length will need to be careful during thrusting.
Direct answer: yes, you can do the missionary position with a downward curved penis.
When i was 15, i have a downward penis also but after i go circumcision i slowly correct it since bonerr would less likely to appear, and now im 18 and its now upward... You dont have to be circumcised to do this, when your flaccid, try to correct your penis with your tight boxers, the boxers will help alot, when you have ***** try to make it upward curve but dont push yourself further, basically you should have alot of patience and its not a short process, you go from downward to straight to upward curved... I hope i answered your question
yes it is and you'll be fine
It's not you.....this is NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! Your boyfriend is a grown man and he doesn't need you to baby him, mother him or rescue him. It's obvious that he was assaulted and needs to report this to the police. So, tell him to grow a pair and either go to the police or call them. This is NOT YOUR FIGHT and the more you try to make it right for him, the more DEPENDENT he will become and the worse he will be. With justice comes healing....he needs to go to the police.
He and mate probably did more than fight and now he is humiliated. You should both go to an endocrinologist and have your hormone levels tested. You probably just have insufficient testosterone and a dr. can correct that for you.
He was raped. Get intouch with rape counselor in your town if you have one. He should press charges. If underwear not washed or clothes place in paperbag for evidence. Tell him it is obvious he was raped or almost Raped. Does he want to talk about it?
I heard from some websites like BBC and the Atlantic that soon lots of diseases will become resistant to antibiotics so diseases that used to be easy to treat will now have a higher risk of death. I'm kind of worried about this. Can any of you guys tell me why this is wrong, or why it's actually nothing to worry about or something? Thanks in advance!
While you shouldn't get freaked out about provocative news stories, it is true that bacteria do mutate and learn how to be resistant to antibiotics. Overuse and misuse of antibiotics are to blame. New antibiotics with superior effectiveness against bacteria, however, are continualy in research and development. The newer antibiotics that become available, however, are more expensive than the older ones.
It is true. You can thank all the people who were prescribed antibiotics and did not properly use them. They took them until they felt better.. When in all reality you are supposed to take the entire prescription until it is gone. They then save the leftovers "just in case", which means another partial course of antibiotics. The point of taking the full course is to finish killing off any of the bacteria that has been weakened. Since it was only weakened, but not killed, it has developed an immunity. This bacteria will go on to reproduce and pass on this immunity. And that is how drug resistant strains form.
It is absolutely something to worry about. I see patients every single day with multi-drug resistant infections. It makes it terribly tough to treat them. If we would quit abusing antibiotics and use them properly, these bugs would not survive and grow resistance to the drugs. Most hospitals and doctors have adopted good antibiotic stewardship programs to limit the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Due to evolution, the strongest survive, This is the same with bacteria. Whilst the antibiotics kill off the easy and weak ones, the stronger bacteria survive and flourish. This continues until those strong ones are wiped out by stronger antibiotics, leaving a few stronger breed to continue on This cycle continues
His "cousin sister"? Just what is a "cousin sister". Most societies/religions frown upon sexual conduct among blood relatives, including fondling... which you referred to as "masturbating her".
It is sick what you just said. Hindu is false religion!

What are some healthier salad dressings to buy or make at home? I have to admit I love ranch but I am trying to slim down for a wedding that I am going to in August so I am looking for healthier choices. If you have any ideas please share them with me! Thank you :) ** My typical salad is made up of organic spinach, hardboiled eggs, bell peppers, sunflower seeds, carrots, and sometimes cranberries. (not all together but these are most of the toppings I use)
Anything that doesn't contain sugar, which is hard to find. The only one in the store I've seen is Newman's Own Oil & Vinegar. You can make your own with olive oil, or any oil you like, vinegar, lemon juice, spices, and even sugar-free Duke's Mayo. Do NOT worry about the fat, it's the carbs you need to avoid when trying to lose weight.
I usually stick to a simple lemon olive oil dressing. For seasoning I use salt, pepper, cumin, and garlic powder
You can make a ranch dressing from yogurt. It would be low cal. Here's a recipe for you: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/214081/emil...
Yes, your penis is a good size. It is bigger than average for your age.
so what you gonna do about it if you are told that its a rubbish size and it will never give pleasure to a woman..
I have the same question and the same size... Snapchat me- tylerjean8
Nah, I had a solid 7" when i was 12.
For another male yes.
it's average for your age
Don't worry about it, it will still grow.
yes
DOn't eat too much pork
Are you saying that your penis is just now growing at the age of 24? No, that isn't normal at all. Seeing any penis growth after 20 years old is somewhat unheard of. Did you actually mean 14?
Not normal at all for it to grow nearly 10 yrs after most guys are done growing.
Back for my third bottle ! 1 inch so far thank you for this miraculous solution from Prolargentsize
That is strange.
Low serotonin is implicated in HOCD & depression. Serotonin is a regulatory neurotransmitter that relies on several dietary factors such as iron, tryptophan, magnesium, various B vitamins (B1 & B6 especially) as well as vitamin D. These factors also influence health in other ways as well. It isn't generally necessary or altogether effective to rely on medication to address serotonin insufficiency. Not addressing nutrient deficiencies inevitably leads to more problems. If you are interested, search some of my other answers for more info.
This happens to a lot of teenagers but it could be either way.

Hi y
Many usa people like to smoke newport and marlboro cigarettes.
You just keep your head up and you keep trying! I am 39 years old and I'm still trying to figure out what I'm good at...I think eventually it will come to me and to you as well. To me, you seem to be very well spoken and intelligent with your words....which is super rare in people of your age! I know it may not seem important to you, but to me it is and I'm sure I'm not the only one that would feel that way. Having good grammar may not be (at this time in your life) what you want to excel in but I can promise you it'll get you places! Best Wishes!
i feel the same way. find a new hobby or activity and don't care about how good you are at it or what the outcome will be. once you stop caring everything gets a lot better. for example during the beginning of middle school i was shy and uncomfortable so i had **** grades and i was depressed. i stopped caring about what others thought of me and just tried my best and now i have a 3.7, lots of friends, and i really enjoy long boarding.
There are good books out there about increasing self-confidence. Go to an online bookstore and get a couple with high reader ratings.
She may have a friend that does similar antics, and they're rubbing off on your sister? I'm only saying this because I know kids at that age unintentionally tend to act like their friends. Maybe it's just some weird stage she's going through. That does sound weird!
Hypomania? Like a mild form of mania but not extreme. Being excitable and compulsively working on things and having an unreasonably high opinion of the results (in this case her art) can be symptoms of a mild form of manic phase of bipolar or cyclothymic disorder. But only a doctor can confirm this. Does she ever have periods of seeming very depressed? Sometimes withdrawal can be a sign of depression
She might be in desperate need of attention. You should encourage her to go to a doctor and just make sure that she isn't developing a mental issue
Yes, its kinda strange. She is probably on something and doesn't want anyone to know. Try to get her to a dr. who can help with meds or something. Or maybe she's not too young for drug rehab.
I would suspect a brain tumor but drugs are a more obvious suspect
She's probably bipolar and right now she's in a mania.
No way to tell, but having sex with other guys doesn;'t have to involve anal penetration at all, if you get aroused by guys then more likely are gay than heterosexual.
asexual. like the 4% of human population, not interested in sex
Possibly asexual, nonsexual, unsexual, antisexual, sexually fluid, mentally ill, or questioning.

There is no set time. Some hardly bleed. I bled for 6 weeks with one and about 8 weeks with the other
It's quite common for some women to have bleeding for that long after giving birth, although ideally you'd like it to stop before then. This bleeding is not, generally, a "period", since periods refer to the bleeding you get when you fail to get pregnant. Postpartum bleeding is instead called "lochia".
Not true, some bleed for a week or so and some dont beed at all for about 6 weeks
Some times but it is not the normal time. Normal is around 2 weeks.
No, I bled for 2 weeks only.
No, not true at all.
maybe.no
Look up yoga classes near you. They tend to be about an hour long and very relaxed. Yoga helps loose weight and tone, if you're specifically loosing weight go to a yoga class called hot yoga. Its where they heat the room from 90*-105* and you sweat out everything over time. Aim to go 3 times a week. And don't be worried about judgment they've seen it all, and are stoked you came to class. Were rather affordable as well for 5-10 classes pass or just a drop in. Google search places near you that do yoga and call they're contact and ask!😀 . Gooodluck!
Exercise has very to do with weight loss. Eat properly. That's what makes the big difference. So there is some good news for you!
Just make a list of the exercises you can do. Then as time goes by increase the numbers of time you do them. Also make sure to eat right.
I am a tea lover. I drink green tea, black tea, follower tea, ice tea... This is my first time to drink herbal weight loss tea. The taste is not bad. I drink one cup everyday. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product did make me a little bit lighter. I will keep drinking it to see what happens to me in long run .
eat that type of food which has low calories and low sugar.try to eat fruits and vegetables because they are energetic.do yoga at home on daily basis/it will keep you relax physically as well as mentally.
Eat healthier foods, I guess.
Hi longer than average at 5 1/2 inches big boy.
No actually your rather big for an adult. By comparison the average flaccid adult penis is around 3 inches and erect between 5 to 6 inches. You have a nice big cock and could continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties. Congratulations.
Not normal at all less than 5% of all men are even 7 inches.
Average is 3.6 inches at 13. Obviously a bigger one looks good in locker room, and possibly might enable sex at a younger age if willing females available. < M.
Well, it's not a matter of 'good', per se. More like comfort, if you get my drift. Also, I suspect you measured it from underneath, which is incorrect.
Eat these foods only... beef, hamburger (no bun), pork, hot dogs (no bun), chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, butter, nuts, green salad with a little dressing. Pick one day a week, the same day and eat other foods in moderation. When you get discouraged, ask your self "what do I hate worse, being fat or no carbs".
Just eat a bunch of salads and chicken and exercise more. Not that I plan on doing that anytime soon... *jiggles belly*
You are your own worst enemy. You just have to do your best and not eat. Try drinking water more often. It may help. That is what I do.
Just always keep yourself busy with something so you don't get bored, and try distracting yourself so you don't think about it.
*Get busy doing something constructive. Exercise something other than your mouth.
do something else. or drink water
You may be able to jump higher as you are moving less weight into the air yes, as for flexibility that is entirely up to stretching unless you are so big that your fat actually prevents you from being flexible or perhaps touching your toes for example.
No you will only be able to do that with practise there are over weight people in gymnastics and olymics who can jump super high and can do crazy flexible things weight has nothing to do with it though it will help but not alot
Yes it would

You need glasses. At best you are reading the centimeter scale.
Maybe you are part barnacle. Barnacles are stationary and therefore need to be well-endowed.
Im guessing you don't know how to measure.
I think your are having really powerful allusions
your just having a dream
I think you mean millimeters
The problem is in-theory doesn't translate to reality, if you want to lose weight, you need to raise your activity level, and eat balanced, starving yourself of 1 nutrient is the perfect setup to yo-yo. So do some sit-ups, and push-ups every morning, and evening, and ride a bike, or walk at a medium-pace for at least 30 mins. You'll lose about 2 lbs per week(which is good, anymore and you run the risk of loose-skin).
all these questions but everyone can't really answer this correctly. you have to eat things in MODERATION. for example if you have (I'm gonna over exaggerate this a lot) half a loaf of bread, a box of rice a roni and a box of pasta. you'd need to have 2 slices of bread 1/4 box of rice a roni or pasta (cut out one or the other) and do that. also you can't just cut it out immediately, you have to let your body adjust. also maybe to go along with it go to the gym or if you can't do that cause its expensive then get an at home exercise app
Eat less calories than your body is using and you will drop weight
cut bread and pasta, too

I usually use olive oil based spread or canola oil spread for sandwiches and what not and sometimes even to cook eggs 🍳 in the frypan 🍳 - perhaps it might help you in your little quest as well
LOL.. you kids crack me up.. You think substituting coconut oil is going to make a chocolate chip cookie, made with REFINED sugar and flour healthy? Just use the damn butter already. There is NOTHING healthy about cookies... if you really cared about healthy, you wouldn't be making chocolate chip cookies..
Coconut oil is fine. Alternately, try grass-fed lard, tallow, or even butter or ghee made from cultured sour cream. The higher the smoke point the better for baking cookies.
It's a contradiction of terms. Sweet, fatty cookies are the antithesis of healthy eating. If you want to make them less fatty, substitute applesauce for half the fat and use fewer chips. My sister baked paleo cookies. I don't have the recipe. You might find it easily and try that
Healthy alternative for chocolate chip cookies - a piece of fruit.
If you don't feel depressed, you probably have clinical depression. Try to manage until you are at least 16. It is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.

I went back and read your question again. It seems you have two concerns, not one. Still talk with the doctor about these two issues you have. They may be switching you to a different type of braces that will help your smile look more natural, while correcting you teeth layout. It is called Invisalign.
Express your concerns to your orthodontist, otherwise they cant help you
If in doubt, share your concerns with your orthodontist.
than talk to the dentist before he removes them and listen to what he has to say first
Theres no need to worry about it. Your 14 so things might get slower to see at first specially your havin puberty... Guys arent always the same, we arent on the same pace. So chill right there and enoy your life dude.
I wouldn't be worried. You are 14, so things may work slower or differently for you, but it will all even out
I was a bit skeptical about buying Prolargent 5x5 Extreme. I love it and would definitely recommend to other people needing a little boost.
I am a female. I am 13 years and 5 months old. I am only 4'11". (I know I'm short) Please give me some tips that will increase my height. What can/will stunt my growth? Please help! I want to be 5'5"-5'7" tall. I don't want to be short when I reach my full adult height. I will have about 7-8 years left of growing. Do you think I will be tall by that time? I grow very slowly. Last year I was 4'11" and still am.
Your adult height is primarily determined by your genes. If you have tall parents, then it is more likely that you will be tall too. Kids/teenagers have growth spurts at different times in their lives. You may have another one coming. Also, when you get your period, that's a sign that you have about two more years of growing. The best thing you can do is to stay healthy by getting enough sleep, eating nutritious foods, and exercising. I would also recommend doing yoga because it helps you develop good posture, which can make you appear to be taller since most people slouch
Women stop growing taller about 2 years after their first period. You can only grow to the height potential your genetic heritage permits. Good diet, staying generally healthy, and getting enough sleep at night will help maximize this potential. But if your parents are short (or your extended family), it's likely you would inherit that height from them.
There is no way to increase height.
Abrasion from your shirt while running on the treadmill can make the nipple sore and cause bleeding. But check it out with the doctor, or course.
A bleeding nipple can be a sign to the early stage of breast cancer.Dont panic and go to the docter asap.
Whatever it is, you should seek a second opinion. Either see a dermatologist (Could be a skin condition) or see another doctor who will take you seriously. My father had breast cancer, and this was not one of his symptoms. Hopefully it is not cancer in any way shape or form, and he will be able to put your mind at ease. Good Luck to you.
It is good you are getting this checked but an infection or simple chaffing are both more likely than cancer as the cause.
Probably coke. If she complains about her face being numb or tingly it's almost definite that she's snorting it. Coke is very expensive and strains relationships as the user becomes more paranoid. Don't give her a reason to be more paranoid.
I believe it's coke, the scratching may be from a allergic reaction. Study her more, if she sounds stuffed or if she sniffs a lot, licks her lips a lot, a craving for salt, alcohol, etc. then it may be coke.
“Every grain bears the name of the one who gets to eat it”. It is an old proverb. "Every patient gets a deserving medicine when he/she suffers some illness" is a modern saying.

I was very skeptical to try it but . Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is simply amazing!, Well, let me tell you, it was SO worth the price! I've been drinking it for about 3 weeks. The first week I only drank it twice a day and missed a day or 2 in there due to not remembering. That first week I lost only about 3 lbs. The second week I've been drinking it three times a day for the most part and have lost about 6-7 lbs more than the 1st week, for a total of about 10 lbs in the first 3 weeks. I found it from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea !
X is right. Using a *file* compression utility (WinZip, RAR, etc), an image file can be compressed without losing any quality at all. However, if you use an *image* compression utility (Microsoft Photo Editor, Ulead, etc), it will definitely lose quality. How much it loses depends on how much you compress it and what format you use. JPG/JPEG format usually gives excellent results and most half-way decent programs let you specify the amount of compression.
Slightly yes, as it compresses the data the picture takes up, but after you extract it from the desired location with winzip or another unzipping tool, it should be back to it's original quality.
No. It doesn't. The file it's stored as does. Say you save the photo as a jpeg image. It's a 'compressed' format so the image file size is smaller normally. Depending on how much it is compressed (usually determined by the camera or photo editing program) determines how good it will look. More compression, the worse it looks. That's why I store all my photos as a PNG image. It's pretty good..
Cancer and infection are entirely different. A liver infection is called hepatitis. Hepatitis is usually caused by a virus, which cannot be cured, but it can be treated to reduce or eliminate symptoms.
No, an infection is not cancer. They will probably be given antibiotics.
liver infection and liver cancer are different diseases. liver infection is treatable. there are viral infections and bacterial infections. the viral infections are treated with supportive care for hep a, supportive care and antivirals for hep b and aggressive antiviral therapy for hep c. bacterial infections are treated with supportive care and antibiotics.
Having an infection does not mean you have cancer. Generally antibiotics will fix up an infection.
Infection and cancer are two different things.
no it doesn't and yes it is if you see a liver doctor
They won't admit you to a psych hospital just for suicidal thoughts.... suicidal thoughts just are not dangerous enough to get you admitted to a hospital that costs Upwards of a few thousand dollars a day. You have to have suicidal thoughts, a valid plan (one that would actually work), the means to carry it out (a rope and a tall tree), AND the intent to do it. Then you get to stay for 72 hours while they put you one antidepressants. Then they send you home with a recommendation to see a psychiatrist and a therapist....
Yes it is however there is a catch. Individuals who come into mental health hospitals with suicidal thoughts unfortunately do not benefit from hospitals stays because this means that individuals do not take responsibility for their actions and rely on the staff to take responsibility for their actions and patients can also pick up traits from other patients to ensure they remain a high risk factor and remain in the hospital this is neither therapeutic for the patient or beneficial to the patient.
If you are feeling suicidal it will be enough to get you committed into a mental hospital.
sometimes depends i was dragged to hospital 3 times 1st when i was coming off drugs and they put me on a 24hr involuntary hold and another time i was taken in because i was suicidal i was seen by the on call psychologist and since they didn't have beds got some drug to help me calm down and was sent home (Y) week later i had actually attempted and was sent home again so i don't know their system but normally u are left feeling let down by the lack of support there is

Almost everyone has fear of public speaking. This is not an anxiety but rather a phobia. The best way to deal with a phobia is to tackle it head on. Do not run away from it as it will only get worse. A study showed that people fear public speaking worse than death. So most people would rather be in the casket than giving a eulogy for someone at a funeral
Yes everyone has anxiety
no. but i'd give it a day off maybe once in awhile. you'll enjoy it more after a break and it helps to prevent chaffing and stuff like that.
No, I started masturbating once a day when I was 13 and it's hasn't done me no harm.
No, it's good. It improves mood and in the long run helps prevent prostate cancer.
yes
only if mom sees you
I can say simple that, Love is an attraction. If someone looks crazy, they fall in love immediately. but actually not. If someone have a already lover or married, they can also fall in love with someone & it may multiple! Now a days Love is an attraction not a relationship !!!
Ywysys
it's great to be in love but it hurts when it ends
There must be enough rewards to offset the pain.
My mother has been a drug addict for years and she has been going to this recovery church group/service. I live with my aunt & uncle because of all the drugs and alcohol. I don t want to be mean and say no but I really don t want to go to a drug addict recovery group. My mother is bipolar and really sensitive so how do I tell her I don t want to go?
UPDATE: Also I am 16 and I have dance on Thursdays and I don't want to miss my classes because I pay for my classes. My mother just wants me to go to church even though I go every Wednesday Friday Saturday and Sunday. My schedule is so busy and trying to fit anything in is like impossible. I try to support her like literally I pay most of her bills because she sleeps all day and she won't take her medicine
It's important that you go to support your mother. I understand this may be uncomfortable for you- but this is important for her, and for her recovery. It's not going to be an all-the-time thing. Try it once, show your support.
In not going you are showing her that you do not support her good works. Keeping clean therefor you will hurt this beings feelings. Please think about how far she has come, you must grow also, or your relationship with her will never get better. Love is for giving. Good luck
Sometimes all you have to do is just be there. I went with a women I met to AA meetings even though I didn't really know her that well, & that's want she needed, was for someone to just be there with her....
She is very sensitive so it really doesn't matter what you say she is going to get upset because she didn't get her own way. There is no avoiding it. Therefore just say "No I don't want to go".
Well .. maybe the baby is just resting, or perhaps it is asleep. They do sleep, you know. Your baby is probably still moving, but you just can't feel it as easily as you once could. At almost 30 weeks, the baby is pretty good sized, and it only has a limited amount of room to move around it. It can't kick and poke as hard as it used to -- it just doesn't have enough room! See your doctor. If he detects a heart beat, then you will know everything's fine and that you have nothing to worry about.
Your baby's gonna be deformed
Stop moving people's questions, question moving jerkoff. You doing this from healthcare could get people killed you freaking moron.
See dr
If you have any doubt, see your GP immediately.
God, that's a tough one! But I think I'll say LSD.. Because that was my first psychedelic, (as well as my first drug ever, other than alcohol, actually), and the one that changed absolutely EVERYTHING! So it will always have a very special place in my heart... Thanks, Lucy. I so love you too!! <3 <3 <3 :) ..And I also love DMT + psilocybin, but that stuff came later. :)

No youre about 10 to 25 lbs overweight depending on body type. Shes about 40 or. 50 lbs overweight
you're 24 why does this girl act like you're in high school also despite you weighing more, you're at a healthier range than she is she's the one who is obese even if she doesn't look it
Set up a ratio to end this argument. Check respective BMI.
She's fatter than you.
no because you r taller and have more muscle and bone so u weigh a little more thats it.
It's called alienation and it's rampant in Western culture. Some psychotherapists, like Neville Symington, feel that our narrow materialistic perspective (selfishness, narcissism) is the root cause of this alienation and/or mental illness. To pull yourself out of this, it is important to cultivate a broader perspective. Some people would call this spirituality (which is different from religious belief). I'd start with a book such as "Being Genuine: Stop Being Nice, Start Being Real" by Thomas d'Ansembourg for some insights on how to avoid the curse of materialism.
You should be seeing a counselor, therapist. What your life is like at 16 has no bearing on what it's like at 25, 30, 35, kid. Keep positive so you can achieve your dreams.
Go online and find the phone numbers of teen crisis hotlines. Write them down and keep them handy. Call when things get really rough. They are free and confidential, so they are safe to talk to. And they are specially trained to help adolescents get on a healthier path.
Being lonely is normal, you are probably depressed. You need to work on finding yourself And think about things that make you happy, suicide is never the answer. Everything gets better love
I'm 16 with no friends either lol. You'll be alright :)
Sentence again! In any case please don't jump into any hasty or wrong steps without taking prior permission from your parents, girlfriend/boyfriend, your own mentor and your family doctor.
No it is not...and you should use your dream of being a doctor to help Others..including yourself.
pls dont suicide
no its not.
You cannot control the chromosome makeup of your sperm. You should be happy to have whatever gender baby you get by luck.
you can't. it's 50/50. you should not go in for having a baby if you are concerned what the sex is.
You cant. There are no male or female sperm. It's all sperm.
Lots of urban myths. None of those work.
sorry but you can't do that
some guys just dont have it
No way to do that.

Brown semen would signal blood in the semen, and brown means it had been an earlier "bleed" that already stopped. So while a bit shocking it more likely means you had a slight bleed in a blood vessel before you ejaculated, and then that blood had time to turn brown before you released. In other words, the blood vessel-- probably a tiny one- that ruptured had already sealed up when you came, otherwise you would see red blood in the semen. But probably want to avoid ejaculating for day or more so that it can ensure you are healed down there. not uncommon for guys to have tiny blood vessels rupture during ejaculation or even urination.
I remember when I first started at around that age, and yes it was brown. I think it has to do with the development of your sex organs. As you hit puberty, your body begins to change (not just in hormones, but well, everything). It should be nothing serious and after a few more times of jerking off, it should turn into a clearish color. If it doesn't and you begin to feel pain in your urethra, then schedule an appointment with a doctor. I had an infection in the urethra once and it was a very painful experience. It can result in you urinating blood and trust me, it hurts a lot.
As a young guy, this may be due to excessive masturbation. If you're masturbating more than once a day, that could be the simple cause. Try stopping for a couple of days, and see if it clears up. Otherwise, see your doctor to make sure there isn't another reason for the brown color.
Others are right: It's blood. But that MAY not be a problem. If you've also got pain, or a fever, or blood in your urine too, the Mayo Clinic says you need to take it seriously. Otherwise, wait a week or two to see if it goes white or clear again, and if it's still brown, THEN take it seriously.
The "brown" fluid in the semen is dead blood cells. Stop masturbating for now, seek Medical help soon .... and be "truthful" with the Doctor Doctors know about this kind of stuff.
Nothing. This is not unusual when beginning ejaculation, unless it goes red shouldn't worry. Probably not even bleeding but discarded blood corpuscles got through the filters. < M
I'm 13 also and I ejeculate white semen, how much do u mastribate? I do it 1-2 times a day, but I take breaks in between. Email me plz.
Stop eating brown sugar
Consult a doctor
You keep your semen reserves low is about all. Sperm banks recommend donation a couple times a week. So if you are trying to make a baby, back off to a couple times a week.
Has no effect, given nearly all males masturbate as teens at least once daily. You don't use up sperm, your body produces millions every hour until you die.
No it won't. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
Keeps you fit. Only affects marriage if wife catches you doing it. < M
Nothing
if your wife catches you it may have an affect
Yes 100 pounds in healthy
By now, you've spoken to doctors and have been evaluated. You are now the best expert on your situation. You are in the lowest percentile for height and needn't gain a lb. If this is your normal weight, maintain it. Check a BMI chart.
You have a BMI of 21. That is in the healthy range.
You're really small, no offense. So yeah, that's a healthy weight for you.
Senior was stupid- old myth. You want to masturbate BECAUSE you have good testosterone levels. You also don't use up or lose testosterone when you masturbate- semen has no testosterone in it. Testosterone is in your bloodstream. In fact you slightly increase testosterone production for a while following ejaculation, so if you want more T, have more ejaculations.
Not much. If you want to boost your testosterone, then lift weights. Big boost in the hours after lifting.
No. = absolute rubbish. < M
No, this has no basis in medicine.
No.
You mean without the semen-- Semen is what comes out of your penis. Only a tiny amount of that is sperm. But yeah, guys often dream they are ejaculating and wake up and nothing happened.
Sperm isn't necessary to have an orgasm whether you are sleep or awake. Are you referring to semen? If so that's a completely different substance produced in a different body part than sperm.
not sure what an orcasm is........sperm is invisible
no it's not
Haha you fat f$@!
Not going to. Your stomach will do that for you. Step on the scale tomorrow. See if you like what you see?
You naughty boy/girl!
Well shame on you.
It is possible you are pregnant. Really knowing when you are ovulating takes very careful attention over a period of several months... just counting the days or occasionally glancing at your cervical mucus won't cut it. But none of us are psychic. If your period doesn't turn up in a few days, take a pregnancy test.
Yes I think you are pregnant. Men lie all the time to get women to sleep with them.
This is gonna be weird so heads up. I masturbated three times within the time span of a day and a half, a couple days ago. What was weird that by the third time, blood was mixed in with my semen when I came. I just thought I should hold off for a couple days but then it happened again. I was wondering if I should see a doctor about this because I honestly don't know why its happening. Btw I'm a male, 22, and a virgin (unfort) if that helps. Also everything else functions properly and there isn't anything else that is irregular
3 times in a day is not excessive. Depends how much blood. Give it 3 - 4 days and try again. If still obviously bleeding see doctor for check. Small blood vessel do break from time to time. Usually repair in 4 days. < M
See a doc
Don't masturbate for a day or two. Then do it again still blood go to the doc.
not an uncommon thing, but it's better if you go to a doctor to check it
You probably have Prostatitis. Different things cause it. You should go and have the doctor check your prostate.
ED is treatable. Treatment options include sex therapy, sexual help devices and even surgery. But you also cannot forget the treatment of medicine. Among them, the Chinese medicine plays a unique role. The TCM Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory Pill have the work of eliminating inflammation and killing various bacteria, which can keep you body in a good condition.
Take an ED pill such as Cialis or Viagra. In most cases it will do the job. You may only need it for the first couple of times. After you have some experience having sex with her you may not need it. It appears your problem is more psychological than physical. (anxiety)
I never lost my erection . So we went for round 2 Prolargentsize .We were having sex for probably a half hour when my gf made me stop. She said her vagina was sore..lol. My close friend is Prolargentsize capsules. It is always in my pocket. I order it from Prolargentsize
I was a bit skeptical about buying Prolargent 5x5 Extreme . I love it and would definitely recommend to other people needing a little boost.
It all depends on genetics. Average is probably a B. At 13 I was literally a 32 A and could still use a training bra. My friend on the other hand already had D cups. I wouldn't say there's a norm as there are lots of different body types.
There's no average. Not all girls grow at the same rate; genetics sometimes play a part in it. When I was 13, I was still in a training bra, but I had friends who were already in regular bras.
It all depends on you, and when you got your period example about a month after my period I gained about 1 cup, I went from a 38 a to a 38b/c
depends on several things from genetics to your nutrition. women in my family are busty so i was a 34d by the time i was that age
A woman's body, before and after sex, is really pretty much identical. I mean, obviously if she caught an STD or got pregnant that would produce changes. But otherwise, sex does not change us.
unless she gets pregnant from it or catches a sexually transmitted disease nothing happens to a womans body after sex.
Your question is quite difficult to read/understand. If you think you were raped, you need to talk to the police. I would also suggest talking to a counselor, or reaching out to a local rape support group.
****.
Get him to wear a condom until you have been on birth control for 21 days or more.
you could end up with an unwanted pregnancy. if you are not going to wait for the pill to become effective use a condom or the sponge
You could ovulate early and become pregnant. Unlikely but possible.
You're not protected and could get pregnant.
They repossess your left breast
I had this once before.. It was because of stressing out over finals my sophomore year aka last year. If you're in highschool and stressed because the end of the year is the WORST then you could be mentally tricking yourself. Go to a doctor if you can and get tested for parasites if you come up negative then go to a psychologist that's what I did!
Sometimes allergies to soaps or foods can make you feel this way. It's just a thought.
Drink lots of Robitussin.
Go to a doctor and tell him or her the problems you have
see a neuroligist
Smarter in what way. It's certainly smart to take fish oil as it contains vitamin D, and Omega 3 oils which is good for the heart. I doubt it affects the brain though.
Its not like you can take some fish oil and then suddenly become smarter. But the omega-3s and other good things in the fish oil can help boost brain productivity, but you have to be willing to learn :-)
Omega 3 maybe. It is said it will because omega 3 repairs cells whicn the brain is made up of and this can off set the age degenerative brain conditions that a lot of people have,So taking omega 3 can be helpful to the whole body
Omega 3 supposedly does that
only dumb people believe that.
OK, you need to go see a doctor immediately. Ask your parents to take you. I suspect you have depression, but you need a full physical and a diagnosis. Then you need medication and treatment. If your parents won't help, then call 911 and ask for a temporary 5150 hold in a mental health unit. They will evaluate what is wrong with you.
Sounds like depression to me. Obviously your brain is not operating correctly.------ Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
Apparently you generated enough thought to compose and type 2 paragraphs and a question.... will you remember to come back to see the answers? This is something that really requires a doctor....

Nope, I recommend trying it, it was quite a fun experience for me. everybody does it.
of course it will hurt and it will burn a lot too

The parks are crowded. You go and just have fun. Bring and apply sunscreen. There's no reason to be unhappy or stress about a fun time. Dress appropriately like a one piece and flip flops

I am pretty sure most messaging services work just fine when fully clothed. In fact i receive messages on my phone just fine while wearing body armor.
You will be told by the massage therapist what to wear. Just go in your usual clothes. Normally you strip off to your underwear.
There's no need for that. Yahoo email works fine fully clothed.
just wear underwear or go naked or ask the massage therapist
yes naked.
No laughter actually helps any healing process. At the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, the care goes beyond what you'll get from your local Oncologists. Does your Oncologist ever discuss nutrition with you?
No, but questions like this indicate that there's something amiss in YOUR brain.
Only if you're a bored adolescent. Oops. You might want to go get yourself checked out.
Laughing is a good tonic both for physical and mental health.
Probably just as much as not laughing.
I hope not because I'm laughing right now.
Of course not but it can cause hiccups
Absolutely not
Laughter is good for the health.
No, but asking stupid questions might.
You will not lose any sexual sensitivity by getting your frenulum removed. The sexually sensitive nerves are not IN the frenulum but UNDER it, so removing the frenulum actually makes them closer to the surface and hence more readily stimulated. The frenulum can be the cause of problems in getting or maintaining an erection. Removing it can only improve matters.
No. Circumcised men have the frenulum and much more removed and they don't seem to have any sexual dysfunction. Better to have slightly less sensitivity than phimosis.
Huh...? No that makes no sense. The entire penis Kama shaft and glans is sensitive. You won't have any problems with sex or masturbation bro.
Hi simple answer when taking a hot bath ease back the foreskin slowly and easily. do this over a number of weeks and it will be become a lot easier to roll back when you need it to during sexual intercourse.
you just have to stretch it out by gently pulling it back everyday. there is also a steroid cream that you can ask the doc for - you know - before letting someone cut your d*ck.
Realize a calorie is not a calorie! Certain ones cause immediate weight gain. It will not be easy, but well worth it: Knock out all sugars, esp fructose & HFCS. They are hidden in a lot out american foods, so be careful as not all ingredients are listed. Watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6... It's hard to watch it all, but well worth it. Knock out any alcohol. Best to buy all organic and make all your foods. Yu can eat almost anything organic, just make sure it's balanced. Realize fats are not your enemy. Eat a portion in every meal. Try to eat as much raw as possible. There ya go, simple but difficult.
Eat a balanced diet and exercise 30 mins a day
Exercise and proper eating habits. Simple as that to be honest.
It actually works. It curbs your appetite and helps you lose weight. I've lost 20 lbs so far. Weight loss gren store tea is great!
All depends on height. for 5'0, it's fine, for 6'0 it's pretty thin.
If you are 5'2", fine. If you are 5'6", too thin.
It depends on how tall you are.
Go get braces right away. You don't want to go through life with messed up teeth. Most orthodontists will give you a free consultation and they will let you know the treatment you need. A dentist can fix the appearance of your front teeth, possibly file them down if they are too large.
An overbite is a very legitimate reason to get braces, really any "bad bite" is (and there are a bunch of types of bad bites), also TMJ or jaw problems. So yes by having "a very bad overbite" you need braces. You can go to an orthodontist even without a dentist referral to one.
Get them

And let those bullies win? Hell no! You have a life ahead of you and you are a worthy person who deserves to be happy, bullies pick on people because they have their own insecurities that they can't face up to. Talk to your parents or someone else you trust but don't ever let anyone make you feel you don't deserve to live because you most certainly do.
No !! We lost two teens last year because of bullying and you are special. We all are and maybe school years aren't the best but I know if you push pass the cruel people and apply your self to your studying you can be anything you want to be and watch them working for you in the future. Talk to your principal and teachers and parents plzzx
NO... no matter what...NEVER.... with your permission I humbly guess you're young enough to be my son/ daughter... firm steps have to be taken- immediately to stop the bullying- whatever it takes...including involving the police as needed... additional questions are to be asked in real life... but I want you to understand that the life and quality of life of NO ONE of us has to be at the mercy of the good or ill will of bullies or anyone else... please-inasmuch as possible- immediately let your closest available family first exactly know what you're going through- ask for and timely get the help you need...
Well....if I were you I whouldnt just give up and let them win, there is no reason to kill yourself cause of a bunch of bullies eventually Karma will get them back. Just simply ignore them for a while and carry on with your valuable life.
No, you should not. I am a 14 y/o severely overweight girl, i get called a "fat ****" at school and i'm still here, alive. You should not care what others think. All you need to care about is your health. Excercise and eat right because you want to be healthy, not because people call you fat. If you exercise because people call you fat, you would not be motivated to do so. You might not be beautiful on the outside based on stereotypes, but all you need to do is be beautiful on the inside. That's what counts.
Go and tell the principal or the dean at your school. Get your parents involved. Do not give up hope! Don't worry about being suspended once or twice ;) If you give them a nice broken nose I'm sure they'll stop then. GET HELP FIRST, THOUGH!
"My fiance has done something that he's done to me once before" KEEP REPEATING THAT 100x more. Your future is hanging on a thin thread. Do something before it breaks in half, because you're NOW ENGAGED with him.

There are so many reasons, why people NOT SHOW UP @ their own wedding!
You're offended that he looks at pictures of naked women? As long as it wasn't children, I don't see the problem.
You need to get out of Dodge city as soon as possible. This may have serous legal implications, since this guy seems to be doing something that is against the law. I would not be surprised, if he did this on purpose, because he is giving you a hint ahead of you finding out, since he did smell the rat, and is sleeping on the couch. This has gone way beyond you and him, and has these hundreds of women, who may sing another tune, if they are illegally on his tablet. Lose the loser.

Rapists don't think so.
Well... that may be how it works for you, but that's not how it is for me. Masturbation has no affect on my ability to perform during partnered sex. When traditional sex isn't available and I feel like I need a release, masturbation is a safe and effective way to achieve it. I do occasionally use porn, but do not rely on it... the theater of the mind (imagination) is all I really need. I would suggest that you go ahead and do whatever you think is right for you, but you shouldn't presume that the experiences of others, even those that are similar to yours, would result in the same circumstances.
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
I use this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product very regularly, I am very active with women and this gives me the edge I need. With this I am able to keep hard and strong all night . Does what it's supposed to do and some. You do get energy, alertness and endurance in a big way. Start of with half and work your way to full. You will keep hard for the entire time.
No. there are too many factors to make such conclusions...but if I were you I would make sure I'm taking a good multi-vitamin everyday ( one with zinc) and getting plenty of sleep, because lack of THOSE things will affect your performance
No reason it would do that; masturbation is just solo sex. Certainly if guys abstain they will be more horny and may even ejaculate a bit more due to a more intensive climax. But if you had sex daily with your partner, probably would enjoy that just as much.
This Prolargent 5x5 Extreme pill changed my life!! Excellent results for days on a single dose.
I'm 13 and haven't started my period yet but my sister got hers when she was 14, so i'm guessing mines coming soon ( got all the symptoms, just not blood ) And I am i HUGE social anxiety person. But anyways, all of my friends have their period and their younger then me but anyways, ( oh i have had discharge for around 2 years ) so i'm wondering if i should like have a school period kit just in case i start at school, i'll be prepared. Thank you.
You don't need a "school period kit". Just tuck a pad or a tampon into your purse or back pack or whatever you normally carry with you, and take it to school with you. Then, if you begin a period at school, you'll be prepared and will have everything you need. Even if you haven't had a period yet, you could do it now -- the pad or tampon could stay in your bag for months if necessary. Anyway, when you have your first period, you're not likely to have a very heavy flow - it will probably just stain your panties a little bit. You don't "gush", you know.
Absolutely! When I was in HS (and even in college), I always had a period kit with me. I just used a makeup bag that wasn't see-through and put some pads, tampons, panty liners and an extra pair of underwear in it. Sometimes I would put a Midol or aspirin in there as well. Even now, I'm in my 30s and I STILL bring a period kit with me in my bag. No one would know the difference - I just have two makeup bags in my purse - one for makeup and one for period stuff.
Yes most definitely I sure you know what to put in it but I'd not just extra panties a pad/tampon and wet wipes if you think you'll need them..also I carry a period kit all the time I've had my period for a long time
I always think a "kit" is overkill... periods are usually *not* that hard to deal with where you need an array of supplies. But keeping a couple of pads in your backpack in case of surprises seems appropriate at your age.
Yeah, leave some supplies in your locker and in your backpack. Also, have you researched period alternatives? Look up the videos on Youtube about cloth pads and menstrual cups. Especially Bree's channel (Precious Stars Pads).
Yep! It would be a good idea to, and it saves you asking the awkward question whether anyone has any pads.
First, get over it. There's nothing you can do about it and IT DOES NOT MATTER. You are average.
Well above average for your age, and stop comparing with p0rn.
its smallish if you are afro american

I was a bit skeptical about buying this because I feel like some of these just don't get the job done but I wanted to please my lady more and boy oh boy this did the job as said. I love this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product and would definitely recommend to other people needing a little boost.
I used the Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product just to see if it would work or not after trying so many others and with no success , I was truly Impress this product is better than viagra, it performs just as it says could not believe it would but it did I would use again and buy it again it was great.
i used to when i used carrots for anal masterbation
Maybe it makes you think of bunnies and you have a bunny fetish? Or thinking of playboy bunnies.
maybe you put them in the wrong hole...
Unfortunately, as you get older, the brain gets used to the sensation and reacts less. It is normal, but is no fun. Also, as you get older, your ejaculation will be less intense. When you are a young teen, you can squirt a few feet, when you get older, it just kind of oozes out.
i feel much better whenever i take this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme. this has a good effect of boosting energy and confidence and it gives me a higher endurance and stamina in bed. I am also receiving the same effect outside of the bedroom. in sports and at work, i am much more energetic.
Are you diabetic? Thats a contributing factor but you're still young
I hope you aren t really 18 because it seems you have 2 problems. One is that you lack vocabulary because you seem to be linking skinny with low muscle mass. I think the word you are looking for is "scrawny" or simply "lacking muscle." Second is that you seem to not understand basic anatomy. You don t lose testosterone when you ejaculate. There are things that can affect your testosterone levels (diet, exercise, supplements, genetics, etc.) but how many times you handle yourself is not one of them.
Unfortunately no. Otherwise slimming would be easy. And no, you do NOT loose any testosterone in ejaculating = it stays in your bloodstream. More ejaculating = your body makes MORE T. Growing big is controlled by inherited genes. < M
You are either being a troll and a really lame one... Or you are mentally ill. Masturbation does not cause that. SMH
nope
Probably about the same rate. Depends on the country of course but in the USA the rate has been always around 99% for decades.
Im sure its about the same per capita. Masturbation has always been popular.
It's about the same, it's very popular to masturbate.
I'm sure scientists are working feverishly to answer this important question.
i dont think there are any stats available but id say that its going up!
the same, biology has not changed
does it matter
I have an extremely severe anxiety disorder that causes symptoms of ADHD. I can't sit still and my mind is consumed with thoughts that I can't control. I'm a junior in high school and I am struggling so much. My grades aren't bad, but my counselor suggested to me that I get my GED. Would that make me a loser? That's what I have heard people say my whole life. That if you get your GED it's because your lazy and incompetent. ** I don't mean to sound ignorant and I don't mean to offend anyone. So please don't misconstrue my words.
A degree is a degree, and having your high school education is highly important. For starters, what do you plan to do as an adult? If you plan on doing a fellowship or apprenticeship then it's possible you may not need anything beyond a GED. However, since you're only in middle school I urge you to explore more options before committing to your future. Also, have you inquired to your parents and/or doctor about acquiring medication for your conditions? That could really change the way things are going for you, because counseling helps but it can only get you so far. I hope this helps, and have a lovely day.
Getting a GED doesn't make you stupid. I am friends with an older gentleman who had to drop out of high school to provide for his ailing mother. He got his GED and he scored high enough that he could do anything he wanted. He's still a truck driver though because of an accident that made his legs bad. That aside, he is still a very intelligent man.
One gets a GED when one didn't graduate from high school. You can't go BACK to high school, nor can you go back in time. A GED is so you can get a job. How does that make you a loser? Trying to rectify your life?
No of course not you can get ur GED and then go straight into community college for the 2 years and move in to college before any of your friends and move up to do big things, go for it if you want to.
I'm 17 male. Look,I'm not one of those people who "broke up" and is wanting suicide only to get over it a week later. I have a PERMANENT disease causing fatigue dizziness migraines and more 24/7, I would rather die than have kids. So I'm alone and no wife either. So that leaves me. I have nothing worth living for. I can't even work 25 hrs a week. I've tried. I can't stand or sit and focus for that long . I want suicide sept 1. I'll be 18. Thoughts?

Self harm is just of the symptoms of depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
Urine contains various chemicals hence the color is pale yellow. If you consume any vitamin tablets then then the yellow color is more prominent. Those suffering from jaundice will have dark yellow color urine. If you are otherwise okay do not worry about color. Enjoy . Regards.
Urine varies in appearance, depending principally upon a body's level of hydration, as well as other factors. Normal urine is a transparent solution ranging from colorless to amber but is usually a pale yellow. In the urine of a healthy individual the color comes primarily from the presence of urobilin. Urobilin in turn is a final waste product resulting from the breakdown of heme from hemoglobin during the destruction of aging blood cells. Colorless urine indicates over-hydration, generally preferable to dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests can suggest an attempt to avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration.
Generally it is B vitamins that are in excess in your body that cause urine to be yellowish. If you take multivitamins you might even see your urine is bright yellow.
Urine can be clear or have a yellowish colour depending on the amount of various chemicals that your body is getting rid of at the time.
Normal, healthy pee actually has a yellow color from a pigment called urochrome. It's true that the darker that yellow becomes, the less hydrated your body is. However, drinking so much water that your pee is clear can actually cause an imbalance in your electrolyte levels.
It's a by-product of Vit B5.
Because of protein by product's from urea and bilirubin.
because of chemicals in it. if you drink a lot of water it wont be yellow
Yes, your penis is a very good size being 6 inches with a girth of 5 inches. It is a very good size soft too. You can definitely change and take showers in the locker rooms without feeling small.
You have a good size but you can also increase your penis size 1 to 2 inch's long... as I have also experienced growth in my penis after using Tongkat Ali Pills that really worked for me.... I was surfing net one day and got its ad on the site...first I was skeptical about using it but later I used it and it worked really well for me and I was amazed with it's outcome.. but beware about the website as there are fake sellers also.. I took it from http://www.tongkataliplus.com/ amazing site and they have a health care executive to guide you... They can be reached at +919056598341... I would suggest you to go for it...
Good size
No. Because no ones penis is 5" in circumference. You're a liar. And probably have a small *** dick. Keep up a good relationship with your hand because you'll never get a girl with a small dick like yours
I think that a nice size coming from a girl around ur age
Well, guys generally don't sport their full erections in locker rooms, just their flaccid size. Certainly near the top on flaccid size on average, so nothing to be ashamed of. If you see some guys in there hanging a lot more down, they probably either thought of sex or played with it to get a bit engorged, or just got turned on by being nude. Not small either way though so be proud of your gear.
I'm 13 4.5 inches soft 6.5-7 inches hard I feel happy as I have lots of growing time left id say yours is ok as that was my size when I was 12 so yes your doing good thats about right
Better size is 6 inch.
Huge bro. Like Ron Jeremy
If you shoot yourself in the leg with a pistol, it would hurt and you could die from either blood loss, infection, or clotting moving through the body. In most cases, quick treatment will make all these problems rare. If you shoot your leg with your foot, a bruise is the most likely outcome, and you will not be in any danger of dying.
Noah said, "You have a 0 percent of dying if shot in the foot unless you have a blood clotting, then youd bleed out. " What the HELL are you talking about? Blood clotting then you bleed out? Kiddie... you are no doctor. If you're stupid enough to shoot yourself in the leg or foot you're stupid enough to die from it. I won't bother going into the bloody details. Better yet... try it and get back to us. If we don't hear from you we'll know you just poured a big slug of chlorine into the gene pool. God, I love the smell of chlorine in the morning.
It's possible but there's a very low risk of you dying. Chances are: • the wound won't heal and you'll bleed to death (will take days) • the wound will develop an infection or gangrene that will eventually kill you (will take days or even weeks) • you die due to shock or panic (almost instantly but very rare)
You have a 0 percent of dying if shot in the foot unless you have a blood clotting, then youd bleed out. If shot in the leg it depends on where you are shot. The higher up the leg, the more serious arteries and veins there are that cant be shot. So it all depends on where on the leg you are shot
As long as you don't manage to sever an artery, not huge.
You have a better chance if through the mouth.
depends how fast you get medical help
dude ur life never experienced it do it if u wnt to
Only women get that kind of treatment like why is there cancer charities for women but almost none for men? More men die because of cancer than women so shouldn't there be more help for the men? No, we live in a world where Women and Children (girls) come first.
Men are encouraged to check themselves. As most men spend most of their time with their hands down their trousers to have a 'Feel' then they can easily feel a lump.
They do. It's part of a routine physical exam.
Men are supposed to check themselves. I thought all men know how to do that.
Why do you keep asking that same question over and over and over again?
Very large size at 7 inches. Odd how most guys on Answers are 7 inches or more. Less than 5% of all men are 7 inches or more. Normal for a flaccid penis to hand downward.
Yes, your penis is a very good size at 7 inches. It is a lot bigger than average.
so what you going to do about it if you are told that its a rubbish size and will never be any good at giving satisfaction to a woman? ....
youre in my dude
Not likely at all. You'll be around 5ft 4/5 and like 99 percent of females will be completely done growing by 15/16.
No chance. Women stop round 15. Your father is average. Your mother well below. Get used to your height. It's unlikely to change.
Unlikely few girls grow that tall
not likely
If you enjoy drinking peppermint and chamomile tea then it's alright. If you're just drinking it because you think it's good for you but don't like it, then stop
Yes. You have my permission to drink herbal tea. What a party animal.
yes,it is not harmful for your health.you can take it if you like it.
Why would it be a problem?
It wont do them any harm and wont boost anything
i eat what fills me up and makes me happy
No, these are low GI (= good carbs)
If you heard it, it must be right.
I've always been rather skinny and at the moment I'm extremely skinny, nearly underweight but, the thing is, my thighs almost look fatter than they were before. My thighs have always been big no matter my weight but, after losing weight, they appear to be even fatter and jigglier than they were before. Can anyone explain this?
Everyone's thighs jiggle
Thighs? The largest muscle of your body? Of COURSE they will jiggle, everyone's thighs jiggle. Only people who's thighs don't jiggle are those who are 5'6 and 62lbs, or those whose legs were blown off at Vietnam. Sounds a bit dysmorphic.
If you're extremely skinny I don't understand how your thighs can jiggle although it could be mostly skin.
I agree with "Noah" and "Sauna". A lot of anorexics get extremely skinny, but that doesn't mean their thighs have any muscle. A lack of protein, bad diets and all you have is loose skin, and bits of fat. This is what is jiggling, muscle doesn't.
The thigh muscles are the LARGEST muscle group for everyone. They ALL JIGGLE.
body dysmorphia? they definitely aren't MORE 'fat'. it could also just be in comparison to the rest of your body. plus, if you have a high body fat ratio.
Is the therapist helping you with anything? Maybe attending sessions and dredging up more actually causes anxiety and thinking too much about everything. Think what others do who don't have any money or the luxury of going to a therapist or enough time in the day to go on the computer and ask strangers what to do. Basically it's needing attention - totally typical for teenagers - so nothing abnormal in that way. Cutting has become trendy in an unfortunate way. Get out of yourself and learn to play an instrument, write poetry, paint, help disabled children or the elderly - fill your time with being productive and making someone's life easier or better. Stop focusing on yourself.
First, definitely tell your therapist. That is the only way to get help from them about cutting. Second, go online and find the phone numbers for cutting/self-harm hotlines. Write them down and keep them handy. Call the next time you are tempted to cut and when you won't be interrupted. They are free and confidential, so they are easy to talk to. And they are specially trained to help people in your exact situation. Make the call.
You should definitely tell your therapist. If you are less than honest with her, she can hardly help you. Be glad you have help so readily available! If you imagine you can keep this activity a secret for much longer, you are wrong.
It's not present tense, it's I had a heart attack. It's in the past.
I have had a heart attack. Use "a" instead of "the." However, for other diseases, you don't use "a" or "the." For example: I have diabetes. I have tuberculosis. You don't use "the" in front of any disease I can think of.
It depends on what disease you're talking about and how you're using it in a sentence. You would not use either of the sentences you wrote. "I'm having a heart attack" "I had a heart attack" "The heart attack is what killed him" "A heart attack is what killed him" "I have diabetes"
Just say I have a heart attack or. With others, such as the flu, you would use the article the.
I have a heart attack I have the flu I have a cold I have cancer I have diabetes I have a broken leg
If you're on a diet don't eat so many carbs. They bloat you. Have foods with a lot of nutrients like fruits veggies and lean proteins. Also living off 600 cal a day isn't sustainable. You'll end up crashing, binging and gaining it all back plus more. Trust me I've done it all.
You keep asking this question and you keep getting told that 1. You are eating too many carbs. And 2. You are eating too few calories. It would help to educate yourself about the types of calories that exist and how they affect your weight and your body, that way you won't be on here repeating the same nonsense question. Knowledge is power.
There is NO SUCH THING as a 600 calorie diet. That`s called STARVATION. You are at a perfectly healthy weight and have no reason to be dieting. The foods you`re eating are absolute crap. You could consume a proper diet of 1200 calories of proper food and be a hell of a lot healthier and happier than you are now.
I'm not calling you stupid because you asked me not to. All I will tell is research how to lose weight properly, look up Mike Matthews and research energy balance for weight loss. As for your question, with the piece of toast you will be going over 600 calories. Good luck.
You need to stop obsessing. There's worse things than not being skinny. Like being mentally anguished and anorixic. You need help. And yes you should eat if you're hungry.
Possibly a cavity that is hot sensitive. I suggest getting an x-ray taken to see if you have a cavity. If it is a cavity you want to make sure you get it taken care of before it turns into the need for a root canal. Those can be pricey!
pain with hot foods or drinks that lingers more than a few seconds usually means you need a root canal. the fact that it lasts for up to 2 hours means it's pretty likely.
you might need a root canal in that tooth
Probably a cavity or tiny crack
make an appointment with you dentist asap
Why cant i just expire already? ~~~ Notice from management; All units come with an expiration date. It is inevitable. The perfect moment! Perhaps yours is not yet? Might as well Pay Attention until then, you might find something 'interesting'! Again, and again, and again....!! *__- They are just passing 'feelings' (thoughts), and they always pass! The comfortable and warm feelings, the cold uncomfortable feelings, all of them, just an ephemeral passing parade before our awareness. Never 'believe' it! Never 'believe' your thoughts! Therein lies insanity!
Deal with the devil you know. When your body dies your soul will be just recycled into a new body, and it *might* not be in a body, place, and time that is better than what you have now.
The can you are in probably hasn't been stamped yet .

Lesson learned.. Well here's how it all started.. I used to date her back in middle school. She was actually the first girlfriend I ever had.. we split up before highs school and didn't talk for several years.. I had hit her up one day on Facebook and we started talking.. we hung out a few times and things seemed like they were going good. I was acting like a gentleman and the lady gave me a kiss..a week goes by and I start seeing things not adding up
Yeah, don't hang around with psycho chicks like that.
You take it to the police and let them test it.
I overheard one engineer make the claim that we do not know the long-term effects of radiation from 60 Hz electricity. That's probably a true statement. I am not aware of any long-term studies of the effects of low level electrical radiation on mammals. Given the fact that 99.99% of us will opt to live near electric power lines and live with electric power in our homes and offices, a better question is how to better cope with the anxiety and depression that is so common in teenagers. I'd start with the book "Saying What's Real" by Susan Campbell. We cannot change some factors, but perhaps there are other factors within our own psyche that we can change.
I would like to see some proof of this statement. Believe it or not, there is always electricity around you, it's a part of nature, and you'd die without it.
you ask yourself, why do we exist if we make harm to each other? and we are the one who have reinvented electricity
No, sorry, don't believe it.
No. Brain damage requires some sort of physical trauma.
Yes
Depression is basically your brain being overly sensitive. So no.
no it can't
No
I've had it for years and it took me 4 years to finally go to therapy....it never fully goes but you learn to deal with it! CBT really helped me but meds not so much! I still get it now but i can handle it a lot better to be honest i should probably go the see my therapist every now and again for a top up! Thats my opinion anyway!
Well everyone has some level of anxiety, some have it worse than others though. But I do believe you can lessen it to a pretty big extent.
I have anxiety. But therapy helped me control it. Sometimes I still get it bad but I just know how to calm myself down now I guess.
It's a frame of mind. Change your mindset.
Meditation, medication, counseling.
sure; tell a dr. how you feel. There are good meds for anxiety.
Counselling I guess
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
Iam a woman who has been trying everything and nothing was working ... Arganrain argan oil is my best kept secret.. Got my acne under control even during my period...has been getting my complexion beautifully even... Iam on my second bottle now and extremely happy with the results !! Thanks
Well as god is really all three in one, I think it is safe to say that Jesus disappeared entirely up god's butthole. So in a sense he did have sex with his father.
God jealous of someone? Doesn't make a lot of sense.
The boys got demons in him I tell ya! Demons! And the loch ness monster! And Yeti too! And Jesus!
Such a warped mind you have there. I think you meant to say, "Do you think Anonymous coward was ever jealous that Daddy never ****** him like he ****** mommy?"
Certainly not. Jealousy is a mortal sin.
You win the Troll of the Day award with that one.
You posted this in the right category.
Cowardly coward is cowardly.
you are a coward. you will be punished and tortured for eternity by demons in hell.
no not at all
I have been feeling self conscious about my vagina recently, do I have an ugly vagina? I'm 19 and a virgin and feel like my vagina will be a turn off for when I decide to have sex. :( is it gross? I found a picture online that looks EXACTLY like my vagina. NO JOKE. Like the color and everything. As a matter of fact I thought it was a picture of my vagina itself I got scared. Anyways I got the link to the photo and its the before picture. https://www.google.com/search?q=vaginal+rejuvenation&espv=2&biw=1242&bih=606&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjM4uXt6NnMAhXJJh4KHYysBEgQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=ooKY1zelTbpBSM%3A
What's "pretty" or "ugly" is subjective to the viewer. But in all honesty, all vulva are different (not vagina - that the canal that your tampon goes into). The vulva (which is the outer parts) is different on everyone. Some women have one labia that's longer, some have shorter or longer labia, some have flappy ones. They all serve the same function. It's no different from boobs where everyone's built a little differently but all serve the same purpose. Rather than wondering if your vulva is cute or not, just be glad it's there. Most guys don't care what it looks like - all they care is that they get to see it and touch it.
When a guy is with a woman and they are aroused he isn't going to care what her vagina looks like. All he will want to do is get his stiff penis in it. Sorry don't mean to be rude.
no such thing as an ugly vagina
Guys don't care what your pussy looks like, just how it feels during sex.
LOVE YOURSELF GIRL . SO WHAT IF ITS UGLY . THATS YOUR POINT OF VEIW . WE LIKE VAGINAS CU THEY FEEL GOOD NOT LOOK GOOD .
Ok so in December I decided I wanted to get shredded for this summer and I lost a stone and put on some muscle. At the moment I am looking quite lean but what I want to know is how do I lower my body fat percentage down to shredded state. I am 17 and I wanna loose body fat and keep my muscle I already have. I have 50 days to do this. What kind of training? How many times a week? Diet plan? Lay it all out there guys thanks
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product helped give me a flatter stomach. As we all know, lower belly fat is hard to get rid of. It also curbed my appetite without me feeling like I was missing out on something. Had more energy, without it affecting my ability to sleep. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't have any side effects.
You LOSE weight, you don't LOOSE it.
loose it ... lol get that flab loose, shake it!
Yes because you don't have much fat in your body. I'm not saying thin women can't have large breasts because some actually do but boobs are made of fat tissue so if you gained weight your boobs would grow more. I'm small too and barely have a butt or hips so I feel like I'm less of a woman :( it's just how we are born tho
I think only a woman would quote so many measurements of different body parts, so you are a woman okay ;o) I don't even know what they all mean. But just relax about it. Breasts are beautiful, even when smaller than yours.
You're just fine. No need to feel less a woman or self conscious about yourself. If you were to gain weight, yes your boobs would grow but so wouldn't places you wanted to keep slender.
Friends lie since they know no one will challenge them to prove it. Might even try that sometime- bring a ruler and challenge guys to "measure up". Bet they will all run. Less than 5% of all men are even 7 inches. Rare for over 8 inches and extremely rare for 9 inches. So they are lying.
grow up and stop posting rubbish. why would 15 years olds have longer penis than a grown adult?
EIther a troll or a porn addict.
tell your friends to show you
Sexually abusing the elderly is a serious crime. You didn't specify why you were looking at an old man's penis but keep in mind that this sounds very suspicious and illegal.
Sorry to say but you'll just have to live with it, you could try distracting yourself and keeping busy
Ha! That's the old guy trick! It came out of the bottom of his shorts, I bet.
So you accidentally saw a penis. So what? Get over yourself.
depends if you are a girl or boy.........if its your first you should get out more
Well you too have penis , the only difference is his pubic hairs are grey and yours black. Forget it my friend. Regards.
Get over it...
Einstein, with all his intellectual might but zero intuition, thought that the Universe was still, even though Lemaitre was around... If Einstein were a bit smarter, he could have stated that he hasn't computed it... Hawkins stating that "there is no God" contradicts Ghandi at least... Apparently, artificial intelligence does not contain a soul... If he "can't make it" doesn't mean other souls can't... Retards! Tesla rulz!
We don't. Idiot, there are a ton of Christian scientists. I myself am a type of scientist and a science lover for life. You can't base an entire group of MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS of people based on a few wackjob fundamentalists. Grow up, please.
Where do you get such silly notions ? Many of the greatest scientists who ever lived were Christians, like Kepler, Newton, Bacon, Galileo, Faraday, and many others. Listen to a man who knows more about the topic than you or I...... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSF_e8fE...
They fail to understand that an individual purposes logic to find truth and in doing so that simply goes against the grain of the irrational Bible. Akin to a child blocking his / her ears to avoid hearing what they do not wish to hear. Atheist.
It's not fake Christians who make fun of him, it's actual Christians.
Because they have been indoctrinated by the extremist sects and cults to believe that God was not clever enough to use the big bang, evolution and science as his tools!
we don't hate scientists, we just offer alternative worldviews when it comes to things like evolution.
I make fun of Dawkins, he's an idiot that knows he got way "over-estimated" with his special crew of followers. Einstein was the Mac, I love him. He puts the boo in KABOOM!

The Paleontologist is despised the most. (: With their fossils and setch.
I recently graduated college and work a regular 9-5.I've gained a lot of weight in the past 3 years. I want to do something active that's fun, but not the gym, I despise going inside somewhere and staying in one place to work out. But feel I am too overweight to join any local sports leagues. What do you do for fitness thats fun?
Hike. Bike. Ski. Kayak. Canoe. Backpack. Swim Run Trike Climb/boulder Walk.
I bought a bike and have really gotten into cycling great low impact cardio work-out also a lot more fun cruising on the open road or trails than on a stationary bike in a smelly gym. Also if you have your own place doing yard work and building stuff can also burn lots of calories.
I workout daily with GSP's Rushfit DVD's skip rope out in the back lane for 35 minutes and go swimming for an hour at the city indoor pool.
Running. Join a local sort league.
this can be urine infection. drink plenty of water with lemon juice .1 spoon of honey do this 3 times a day eat more fresh garlic. If the pain is only 1-2 days then nothing to worry about if it is every day then it is kidney stones. so u cut down on red meat .There is too much uric acid in the body. eat more fresh fruits like melons,water melons and cranberry juice and make sure you get the right one as some drinks only have 10 % juice.go for 30%.
Requires a DOCTOR's prescription. < M
See your doc, need antibiotics most likely.
see a dr
it depends on the exact reason. see a doctor
if, you should visit a urologist
Because you didn't really do anything to lose fat. For the most part, we know very clearly wht to do to make your cells do stuff. All this is, is convincing your cells by nudging them over time. You've convinced your muscles to grow a little in the legs, but you have not asked the fat to be used yet.
Mmmm, well, body fat melts away, mainly, by doing cardio, so muscles-groups-exercises mostly strengthen the muscle itself. Fat burn has many factors to help with, first of all, your metabolism. Then other factors like your calorie in-take, density of your exercises, and how long they are, besides how various are they. So, bottom line, everybody's different, maybe you need to adjust one of those things I mentioned, or just you need to wait for some more time. Best of luck : )
I like this Muslim guy, and he likes me too. He asked his parents if he could date me, but they said no since I am Christian. I thought that a Muslim guy could date a Christian woman. I talked to some of my other Muslim friends, and they just told me that it is very looked down upon. Is there anything I could do to get his parents approval?
Well 1 Corinthians 7:39 provides the strong counsel for Christians to ‘marry in the Lord’ is the apostle’s admonition, which is in harmony with the practice of ancient worshipers of God in marrying only those who were likewise true worshipers. That principle applies to dating as well so prayerfully consider that counsel in conjunction with your desire to live a proper Christian lifestyle and let that guide your decision. I hope you the best.
When a Muslim man marries. She is expected to be a servant to His parents. If they approve of you. You will be the one to do their work.
erm I don't think thell allow him to go out with you since they said no. you might as well speack to his parents.
No, those are their rules. His parents are not going to change their minds.
No. The Bible says not to be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
yes remove brain software ,,,install update for 20th century ,,,

yes; and vice versa
So I had pneumonia about 2 months ago and had a lot of chest pain. So after it was gone I got a chest X-ray and everything was clear. I went back to the hospital due to chest pain again and got another chest X-ray it was clear again. Then I went back one more time and yet again it was completely clean. Would they have spotted lung cancer if it was there? I just really have been freaking myself out lately and can t tell if this is a carry over from my pneumonia or just chest pain from all the anxiety. PLEASE help me out.
Hi you would need an x ray in about 6 months time as the Pneumonia will have left scare tissue on your lungs.
A chest x-ray would certainly tell your doctor that there was *something* in your lung that needed investigating. Those other investigations would tell if that *something* was cancer or if it was something else.
If three X-Rays, checked by a competent doctor, are clear then it is probably the result of scarring and anxiety. A freind of mine had Pneumonia, and Pyema, about 10 years ago and still gets the occasional painful twinge.
It would show a huge tumour if you had cancer, how else could they diagnose cancer. Stop being neurotic.
Yes, you should, at least to a certain extent control portions of fruit and veggies. Fruit does have a lot of sugar, but also good nutrients. Eating too much of anything can make you gain weight.
Fruits AND vegetables have sugar, fruits obviously having more. EVERYTHING requires portion control, and in this case, your body will do that automatically. You don't need to consciously control how much f&v you eat. What makes you feel full is insoluble fiber, which fruits and veggies have much of. Your body requires calories, and sugar is a quick and easy way to get calories. ADDED sugar is a quick and easy way to consume TOO MUCH, bc there is no fiber in sugar as there is in f&v. Fiber fills you up and regulates the absorption of the sugar found in f&v. So, fruits and vegetables have built-in portion controls.
Natural sugars aren't anywhere near the same as processed sugars,
Ah, well, you can find your prostate by sticking a finger up your **** - that's how doctors perform prostate exams.
do you mean prostitutes? hookers? depends on how low class and dirty you want to go - if you are under 18, no prosti is going to come anywhere near you
grow up and come back when you are 18

I ignore them but I am more tired of people saying things like I have a pain in my chest am I having a heart attack or I have a cough do I have lung cancer or I have a headache do I have a brain tumour - how do we know?
I think you're judgmental for generalizing an entire website, and I think that's stupid quite frankly.
5' 5" Normal: 114 to 149 lbs. Fat: 150 to 179 lbs. OBESE: 180 to 234 lbs. https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/qui...
Unfortunately, yes. You are about 60 pounds or more overweight for your height.
What matters is the percentage of body fat in ratio to lean body mass...... If you are all muscle with a low body fat percentage then no, you are not obese.
Yeah a little but don't feel bad
Yes, as much as I hate to say it but you are very overweight.

I have diarrhea and that means I've wiped my *** like 5 times today. I am a clean freak when it comes to wiping, and I make sure to wipe really good until all the poop is gone. Well, it's kinda rough on my butthole to wipe so much. It hurts and I'm getting small traces of blood on the toilet paper. Do I really gotta shower every time after I sh*t? Seems like a hassle.
Use wet wipes. It is more convenient to toilet paper and faster than a shower.
you need WET WIPES and you need, ALOE VERA GEL after the wipes, it will soothe your raw butt hole
Ask your mom to do it for you
I legit want to move to Canada. Like the place always seemed so cool and if Donald Trump becomes president that's where I'm going anyways. I also wanna go to college there but I also really want to stop my period cause I think I have endometriosis. I have HORRIBLE heavy periods that bleed through heavy duty pads in about an hour. And it bleeds through my pants bad it's super embarrassing. I know I won't have children in he future cause I'm aro/ace so it's all good. So can I get a hysterectomy in Canada
No Dr will do a hysterectomy unless there is a good health reason. They certainly aren't going to do it on a young, childless woman. There's other treatment options, such as birth control. Now, maybe when you are 35-45, had a kid or two and have gone thru various treatment options, then you MIGHT find a Dr willing to entertain the idea.
it's normal for your age
Yes.
Nope not even in U.K. Would be at 14. < M
sure.... if ur 13 months old!!! HAHAHAHA BABY DlCK!!
at 13 years, of course
Who knows? If it stays that way will be small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Try eating fruit, they have good sugars in them.
Peanut butter and jam on whole wheat bread has the combination of fast acting sugar, mid-level carbs, and protein to moderate and sustain the higher blood sugar level without causing a crash. [Fruit is good, too. 83 only feels low. {Unless your meter is inaccurate, and the real reading is much lower.} 80 - 120 is (was?) the standard range.]
Your blood sugar (glucose) level is already "up", my friend. 83 mg/dL is NOT low.

Crushed garlic, vinegar, and olive oil. Avoid anything with sugar - which is ALL commercial salad dressings.
Salad dressing is very unhealthy limit it as much as you can

You are a healthy weight. Maybe gain a few pounds.
If I calculated it right your BMI is 18.4. Usually a BMI of 18.5-24.9 is healthy weight. So based on this limited information I would say you are at a healthy weight.
Yeah perfect weight, if anything a little too low
Healthy! If you want to be toner, search ab workouts on YouTube!
Yes!
you're a tiny bit underweight. Not too bad though.
-You're JUST "Right." So don't give it another Thought. :)

Make a list of all the ways you and your friend came up with and then call your primary care doctor. Ask them if they can help you with a project you are working on. Let them you were debating which way would be the quickest and least painful way to kill yourself with a friend so you two made a list and you wanted to schedule some time with the doctor to go over your list and have them help you rank the ways you came up with. If they can not help you ask them to refer you to someone that can.

Gun shot to the head but I'd research where to shot urself just saying also because guns are pretty common in America but I guess the best way would be a type of poison idk what kind but I'm sure there's one that numbs you and and slowly kills you

Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked amazingly. Kept getting me hard for almost 4 days and I felt huge! Could last longer the first time , then was hard and ready again in minutes. The second time lasted forever. Well worth it to me!
Yes your penis will only get hard when you are aroused.

It's totally normal. It just means you were turned on. Your body produces natural lubricants when you get turned on to prepare for sex. The only time this isn't normal is if it a) smells, b) is any color besides clear or a slight milky color or c) has a (forgive me) has a cottage cheese-like texture because these are all signs of infection. Also I just have to add bc I'm overprotective of everyone, that you should make sure to communicate with your bf and be sure you both know your limits. If you have sex always make sure to use a condom no matter what anyone says.
Being wet is a natural thing babe. It means you were turned on lol definately not a bad thing. But its bad tht he went n told everyone. guys actually like it when girls are wet lol
Nothing wrong with getting wet when you get aroused. He shouldn't go around and tell everybody how wet you get though. It should be something that only him and you share.
Yes it is normal for you to become really wet, but I would dump this guy, he should not be telling everyone this, what happens during sex is private, not for him to be telling the whole world
normal- suggest you learn How your body Works Sexually First-- getting wet means your body is turned on and getting lubed for Sex- this is Basic Sex Ed http://www.scarleteen.com/article/sexual...
Good you were wet. Bad that he told every one. I'd ***** him out for that.
yes, your body secretes lubrication when you're aroused. but it's quite rude and disrespectful of your boyfriend to be telling everyone that, shouldn't it be between both of you guys only?
It's AWFUL.

All dentist can make dentures. Some like it more than others. Some of the younger ones don not like to, and older ones tend to have more experience, since more and more people are keeping their teeth. I have been practicing for 20 years and I love making them. I have friends who hate making them and may refer you to a prosthodontist.
a prosthodontist takes impressions and measurements and has a dental technician make dentures. a general dentist can also order dentures from a technician or lab.
most general dentists can make dentures. More difficult cases are prosthodontists.
The kind that makes Dentures
Denturist which is not technically a dentist.
Prosthodontists are the specialist for denture...

i was looking for my hymen and tried inserting a finger. mine and my boyfriends fingers have been in there before, this time i was half lying down/ sat up. i fut my finger in a felt almost like a sensitive muscle close to the opening? i was wondering what this is? i have felt a sort of muscle before. is it just my vagina? when i looked it was almost like it block part of the vagina opening?
There are multiple muscles present that form the pelvic floor and support the vagina. You know how you can pee, and stop mid-stream if there's a reason to? (For me, it's usually to tell if the phone is ringing.) Those muscles that stop the flow of pee are the pelvic floor. That group of muscles plus the pubococcygeus muscle contract when a woman has an orgasm.
the vagina IS a muscle
The hydrochloric acid in your stomach will kill them if they have not already been suffocated by the time they get down there
Probably not, because it's hot in your stomach and the stomach acid would kill them
No , human acidity kill them and take them as a meat

I have always maintained healthy eating habits and try two exercise three times a week but I still have some weight that I just cannot lose. When I started with Weight Loss Green Store Tea product initially I felt let down but after the seventh day I started to see a gradual weight loss. I guess I was expecting a miracle and not letting Weight Loss Green Store Tea product get to work. I am now only a few pounds away from my target weight
Weight loss is not linear so you will not always lose and a week is not a plateau. It isn't a plateau unless it's been 4-6 weeks with no change and for optimal muscle gain, you would need a surplus of calories and for weight loss you need to be in a deficit. Lifting helps retain lean muscle while losing and since you're still pretty young and male it isn't out of the question to gain some muscle while losing but again for optimal muscle growth a surplus of calories is needed.
Okay lissen to the pro. Eat 6 times a day and make it to around 2000-2500 calories. Your body will then burn more calories and you will be able to lift more. And I took a 3-5 month brake from doing anythiinmg with excercise and my muscles shrivled up. Now my muscles grow rapidly to where they were and probably are a lot bigger. Point of story yeah it is probably muscle memory but can be water and salt if you started to drink more water. If you want to lose weight try hiit. It's the best way of burning calories. Read a little about it.

I'm 16 years old, and for as long as I've been going through puberty my skin has been so bad. My face always has pimples, blackheads, whiteheads and dialated pores, as well as my chest and my back (bacne). I drink 4 litres of water a day, I eat a lot of fresh produce and I exfoliate and wash my skin with anti-bacterial soap. Nothing is working and it makes me very insecure. *I'm also on the mini-pill to help but it does nothing. What can I possibly do from here?
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Drink less water, over-hydration flushes away vitamins, and minerals before they can metabolize, stick to 2 liters. Secondly, less processed sugar, it inflames the skin a little, and especially during puberty it's usually the bottleneck that allows dirt to clogg-up, instead of just be expelled. Finally, do any of those fresh-produce ever tingle on your lips, or tongue? Because you could also be having some allergic reaction to a food.
you could be washing too much. i honstly think soap clogs your pores.. try not using soap as often.. just rinse with hot water for a long time every now and then and finsih with cold water.. hot water opens and cleanses the pores and cold water closes them when youre done.. this is also good for your circulatory and immune system.. you can switch back and forth too. hot for a few minutes, cold for a few minutes back and forth.. flushing them out. soap isnt really necessary and might make things worse. i honestly hardly ever use soap unless i have a lot of dirt and tar or something. try it.
Get bevoline, it completely cleared my bacne in about a day and it also got the acne I had on my face and neck area but that took about two to three days. I still use it from time to time when I get a pimple. I f***ing love it!
Unfortunately, I'm not an orthodontist. However, I would say chewing gum is kind of bad for you (I'm guessing here as I haven't yet had chewing gum yet with braces), but it would have a considerably high chance it would get stuck in your braces. It might not seem so bad; however, there is quite a chance that they could get stuck, and if it does, I can't imagine the removing of it wouldn't be extremely easy, probably quite difficult. I personally would stay away from it (I have done so far).
I've had braces for more then a year now and I've chewed gum so many times I can't count!!! Your fine just try not to get it stuck in your braces.
Ask your orthodontist.
you can faint...lol

You have obviously not properly overcomed with your anorexia yet. Which is okay. But please tell someone how you're feeling. There is no point going back to the way you used to be after spending so long trying to get better. There is so many negative and dangerous outcomes that could come out of going back to being anorexic. Just eat a healthy balanced diet and try to tell yourself that its better for yourself and for everyone who loves you.
Yes, it is normal, but you should continue on the road to recovery. You will be much happier and healthier down the road.
you are still not recovered and are out of touch with reality. Go back to your dr and tell him
Please go and seek medical assistance. If you become anorexic again you could become really unwell and even die.
no dont it is extremely dangerous and if you continue doing it you could eventually die of starvation
By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some degree.

Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
It is what is called "Fate" and nothing can be done about it. You have to consult a good astrologer with your horoscope. He will give a good solution.
Could be a common cold, could be a form of hayfever, might be some sort of other allergy .... if the problem continues for more than a week or two, you might want to go get an allergy test.

For a healthy life research has told us not to work over 50 hours a week or you can end up In an early grave
I don't think it is too much if the rest of your life practices healthy choices. Some people work 70 to 75 hours a week to make ends meet. Just relax and don't try to burn the candle at both ends as some say.
You need to keep an eye on it, but if this is something you enjoy then at this time of your life it should be fine. Keep track of your feeling and if you start feeling tired work a couple of shirt days. If you feel stressed take a holiday and work 5 day weeks for a couple of weeks.
You might. But change is up to you and nobody else.
No, that is fine.
No, everyone does this and it happens to all of us. The warning is just there for those who use a netti pot to wash out a sinus infection, and don't use purified water. It is terribly rare, yet they warn you to use purified or distilled water when washing out the nose this way. Getting it in your nose once in the shower won't do it . . . be completely at peace, really. Ain't gonna happen, honest! :-)
Brain eating parasites live in warm fresh water outside, such as rivers and lakes. They don't live in tap water, so you'll be fine.
Yes. Amoebas will get into your brain, reproduce and start breaking apart your brain tissue. They will literally eat your brain from the inside out. You will get head aches, next pains, nausea, and eventually you will start blacking out. This has a 97% mortality rate so you will most likely die a slow painful and incurable death. Jk your fine, amoebas don't live in your shower.
do you get your shower water from a shallow ditch ? that is where those parasites live .
Too Late. This question indicates they have already inhabited your brain.
Of course you are going to die, everyone dies. Unless you have a habit of going for a swim or bathe in Contaminated water you have little to fear.
Not from a shower. More likely from watching MSNBC.
Since overweight people are vastly more likely to have overweight kids, should a couple who have allowed themselves to become obese be allowed to pass on their health problems to their children? Obese children almost always go on to be obese adults and have so many health problems later on, not to mention a shorter life span. Isn't this cruel, bringing someone into the world knowing the quality of life you're almost certainly condemning them to?
Not necessarily is it that an obese parent will raise obese children. That is a misconception. I believe that any person should be allowed to have children despite their lifestyle choices. Certainly it is important that the children are healthy, but it is quite brutal to assume that just because a parent is obese that his/her children will be too.
Obesity is not a crime. Two obese parents do not necessarily have obese children. Unless you are a model of human perfection yourself, you need to mind your own business.
I think you shouldn't be allowed children, it's kind of cruel to condemn them into a life with you. Stupid parents tend to have stupid children after all?
Yes they most certainly should. My Sister in law is overweight, and both of her children are tall and skinny. This has nothing to do with being fat and pregnant.
Surely a shorter life span is a matter of natural selection? Your proposition is draconian..
Hitler is your love lust. And karma exists, have a nice life.
Trump isn't so bad, Trump would make a decent president but Hillary is so horribly corrupt that if she is elected there is a considerable chance that what you predict will come to pass.
The 'liberty' Patrick Henry referred to was popular sovereignty, the ability of the voters to pick their leaders. If Hillary is legitimately elected with a majority of both popular and electoral votes, THAT is the liberty Henry was talking about. YOUR idea of liberty seems to be just whatever -you- want. For instance, Christians see anti-discrimination laws as a violation of their freedom of religion. You see YOUR liberty as the right to dictate your own choice of president. You should leave discussions of 'liberty' to those who understand the term.

My vagina was very itchy so I went to put some cream on it and when I did so I noticed that the inside was EXTREMELY swollen. It's just the two middle pieces. They both swelled up like they are full of fluids. I change my underwear every day I rinse it out with water when I shower and I don't wear super tight underwear. I'm a virgin, so I know it can't be an STD or pregnancy. What's wrong with it? How do I treat it without seeing a doctor?
See a doctor
Depends on strength and type. You should ask your doctor that prescribed them however instead of a bunch of strangers and idiots on yahoo answers though where anybody can say anything and troll spreading rumors and false info. Also if blood thinners are due to heart issues you may want to take a little rest/break from sex for a while to prevent killing yourself... Again just ask your doctor though or an online doctors office thing and not all the idiots/trolls/strangers on yahoo.
This thing works well. I am very satisfied for what its has done to my body. i dont know why some people who tried this male enhancement of huntington labs did not get the result they i get from it. Maybe because they might be doing it wrong. Henceforth all of the negativity about this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product, i have tried and and saw results. Great!
Definitely if you have much lower blood pressure it can impact the ability to get erect.
Probably = depends which one. < M
Well, starting a sentence with 'life sucks' makes it pretty difficult. Google how to be happy.
Live with the right people. Move away from Violence, Drama, And report the Drama. Apoligize to the people you hurt. Don't use drugs or Drink Alcohol or smoke. Draw and Write, get a good Job, Get promoted, Graduate from school, Go to College.
be happy for others when things go well for them. You can not get enough personal gain in your life to be happy for long. secondly base your self esteem on indelible non changing things. if you are very well mannered and paitient be happy with ypour self for those things they don't change. don't compare your self with others.
How old are you? Could this be a case of normal adolescent mood swings? If so, hang on - they will go away.
Ignore your problems that's the best thing you can do, instead of focusing on only the bad.

Seeing the natural ingredients and that it was caffeine free I got a bad figuring why not. I am not to much overweight and a big tea drinker so I could easily slip it in my normal routine. I was impressed over the increased bowel movements it gave me. I also enjoyed the taste promoting me to keep drinking it simply because I liked the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . Then after a week I noticed weight starting to drop off. I guess all those masses clogging my intestines are finally out of my system. Feels good to be clean inside.
Doesn't work that way. Get a library card and spend some months reading learning about how to control ur weight and life
if you are 200+ then you should have 2000 calories because according to doctors, you dont want your body to end up feeding off itself to get callories. stay healthy, be active and make sure those 2000 cals are healthy foods!
With a calculator
im thirteen as well (5'2 is my height) and i'd love to be 92 lbs lol. im currently 106 lbs but I don't consider myself fat or overweight or anything like that. keep in mind there's a height to weight ratio so our weights may differ although im only 1 inch taller than you. The average weight for 5'1 should be 95-116 lbs but im not you doctor so I wouldn't know much. all I can say is that youre definitely not overweight, but even if you were, it wouldn't matter because weight or size doesn't define beauty :)
I would say that is to skinny, but then again you are only 13 years old, so you could be healthy. you could just have a fast metabolism. When I was 13 I was 4'11 85 lbs so I was in the same boat as you are in now. Currently, I am 18 years old, 5'1.5 tall, & weigh in the upper 90's/ close to 100lbs but not quite. Just eat healthy (:
Underweight
Ladies, throw away those do-nothing diet pills! Now there’s a proven way to lose weight fast. It’s called The Beta Switch and it can give you visible results in 20 days! Guaranteed. The trouble with weight loss pills is that they only do part of the job. Sure, they might block fat, but what about the fat you already have? And what about the carbs that turn into fat? The Beta Switch is a great-tasting chocolate shake that delivers a complete “fat attack formula.” It burns and blocks both fat and carbs 24 hours a day … while you work and while you sleep. The Beta Switch is amazing. You lose 19 pounds in 2 weeks! tinyurl.com/fatdiminisherxxxx
Average weight for your height is over 100. You are underweight. You're not a small child anymore...of course your weight will gradually increase
That's kinda too skinny. And you're over weight? Don't be stupid. You'll end up like that girl that's 59 pounds and be the skinniest person Alive
In no way, shape or means are you overweight.
Your healthy, theres no issue with you. Just try to do what you do to maintain your current weight. average weight for a girl your height and age is 90 - 110. Hope I helped!
I'm 5'1 too but I'm 14 and I weigh 130 pounds... So no
Omg girl u need to eat urs shoud be about 110 pounds
I m currently still on the toilet while writing this. I just released one of the biggest turd burgers of my life. It smelled so bad that my nose and sinuses are now in in agony. I need help. Should I seek medical attention? I mean, it smells like someone fed a skunk Indian food and lit it on fire whilst it was pooping it out.
Step One: Plug Your Nose Step Two: Flush the Toilet Step Three: Spray A Gallon of Air Freshenner Step Four: Run To a Different Bathroom This should help you!
Cut your nose off. Or just buy some febreeze
You need to collect the feces in a bucket and take it to the Dr.'s office. Without proof they would not believe you.
No. If you are currently on birth control you can skip your placebo pills and go straight to the next packet of pills and possibly skip your period that way, but short of that, there is no actual way to delay your period. You might want to consider getting a menstrual cup (such as the Meluna, for you I would get the "sporty" model since you are active) and practice with it now since you can leave those in for up to 12 hours.
You could look into getting on continuous birth control. It sounds like you have a lot of time to prepare. However, there are many women who do contact sports without taking this step. Because there's literally dozens of other options. Tampon/menstrual cup + pad + leggings under the uniform usually work.
It is not possible to delay your period, sadly. But your period might come late and my period always comes like a week late. Good luck on your competition! :)
a doctor would KNOW the symptoms of being bipolar and unless your brother knows exactly ow a bipolar person acts, he's not going to fool anyone and if he convinced anyone he is - he should be on medication and you will definitely be able to tell if he is taking the meds or not, because he will act very sluggish and low and aggressiveness is NOT a symptom of Bi Polar
The best thing you can do is stay the bleep out of it. You can't diagnose him yourself, you can't control what he says or does, only what you say and do. Recognize that he's a huge jerk looking for excuses to be a huge jerk. I'd steer clear, personally.
It is but its quite a severe way of telling someone to drop dead, it basically implies that you want the person to suffer in a painful way. It's like telling someone to go and play on the motorway and is usually used in a joking manner but once again it is quite a harsh statement because it implies you either want that person to die or be horrifically crippled for the rest of their life. It kind of depends on the context of what your saying really.
Bleach is not itself a poison, it is just caustic and therefore painful. So, all you have done is told them to do something unpleasant. Have them follow it with some vinegar, that will finish them off.
Pure bleach is extremely caustic and can burn through flesh easily, so yes. I only told them to do that because they are a spam troll.
Yes. It's also very painful.
it's not funny and yes it is the same thing
It is basically the same.
Pretty much
Short of illegal hormones and surgery, you can't increase your height. The best things to do are healthy eating and getting lots of rest. Don't smoke anything (the oxygen deprivation affects growth) and don't drink alcohol. The biggest factor is genetics, which cannot be changed. Ashwaghanda is a member of the nightshade family, which is a poisonous plant. So you have to be careful. It is not known for increasing height. It allegedly boosts your immune system.
No snake oil remedies increase height. Growth hormone injection is the only way. And men stop by 16 not older
nothing can increase your height

Average teen will do it about 30-50 times a month. Average rate of ejaculation for guys in teens/20s is at least once daily. Most guys can ejaculate 3-5 times a day if they put their minds (and hand) to it.
42
Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. If you do it 10 times a day it would be fine.
As often or as little as you want.
Well an IPhone 6 is 5.44 inches. Average adult erect size is 5.16 inches so above average. Not short at all. Quit being scared. Nothing wrong with your penis. Could still grow as well until about 15.
Dude, chill. Your penis is just around the right size for a 14 year old.
I don't think that's too short. I think that's just the right size for your age. If you want it bigger don't worry. It will grow through out puberty
Too short for what? Make a trunk call?
There will be much bigger things in life to worry about then that.
You apparently have difficulty separating science fiction from reality. I'd see a psychiatrist about that.
Aa Bb Cc
Yeah, poor robots.
Yes. I am with you. You are right in your assumptions. "It's just like creating life just to be your slave. No wonder terminator wants to destroy humanity."
we love and respect our parents have a little faith that we'll make good ones too
who said we will build robots just for that?
No rule says you cannot bottom with 7 inch penis. Increasingly gay porn shows guys who swop roles, and as you get older, you may wish to try bi or tri. There is no disadvantage in having a cock a little bigger than 5 inches. < M
Being a bottom has nothing to to do with the size of your penis. It doesn't matter if it is big, average or small. So I would suggest that you stop worrying about size and just get on with the things that interest you.
No, you cannot stop how big your penis gets, and no reason a guy who is a bottom would want a small penis. There is more to gay sex than anal sex, dude. Even if you only receive anally, you would more than likely receive oral stimulation and longer means more length to be stimulated orally.
Nothing can stop it just let it be. And being submissive doesnt require smaller d!ck. The only one you need is to pleasure a guy, make him agressive and dominant. That way he may realize how lucky he is. I am no gay but if i was the guy, i just want to feel how he like it, how he served me...
Walk your dog, you will burn 3, to 4 calories a minute walking

9 pounds of what?
Hershey kisses aren't really a meal, it's not like you're gonna call everyone for dinner and give them a bowl of kisses :P. They are a treat and it depends on your guests. Vegans, people dieting, not into chocolate, will probably not have any. However, if there are giant sweet tooths then they might have a lot. How many people are going to the baby shower?
It depends what you buy if you mean 9 pounds in money. It can probably feed 6 people easily if you buy the right things and cook it yourself.
nine pounds of what because that's a meal for me
Nine pounds of what?
there are so many things happening in the world now; the financial crisis, mass immigration from the 3rd world...globalization...the free movement of people? im in my late 30s, live alone in a council flat...suffer health problems and mental problems.......i have no social support network.........im a lonely man......and im frightened for the future? i don't want to be here now, there is too much going on? i genuinely feel insecure and worried.....is anybody else feel the same?
The world has always had a future that one could be frightened of, but the reality is in general people are living longer, are healthier, and have many new enjoyments, such as the internet. I think you should consider volunteer work, poltical activism, joining a church, joining a club, or taking classes with the express purpose of addressing your loneliness.
I'm sure some people are frightened about the future. You are not alone in that respect. However, I am not frightened about the future. I try to be optimistic. I don't worry about new politicians taking power or immigrants stealing a job away from me I wish I could've gotten. That stuff doesn't bother me. I just try to have faith. I can anticipate the worst but expect the best.
The world can be a frightening and lonely place-but it doesn't have to stay that way! Make some friends, try a new hobby, take a vacation-whatever you need to relax and remember that some problems have always been present in the world and can't be solved no matter how much you worry. If you still feel anxious, consider visiting a therapist or talking to a relative/friend. And if you have medication, make sure you take it.
As much as you want to, to a certain extent. When you begin to get sore, then you should give it a rest for a while
Most average once a day.
Well however much you do is fine. Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much.
As often as you can so you'll know your limit once you have a girl.
You should increase the number to 100x a week :P
much as you want. start asking girls to watch them pee and be amazed. its awesome
I've had my period for nearly 5 years, and I have never taken a bath during that time. I always just showered. I'm really in need of some relaxation and cramp relief. I know that it isn't dangerous or anything, but I still have a lingering fear that I'll end up bathing in my blood. Plus. my parents think that too..... Do you take a bath during your period or just a shower? And is bubble bath okay to use?
Cant guarantee that you wont be bathing in your own blood, but I have taken a bath many times while on, heavy, and ive never had a problem. It always seems to stop wen i get in water. And if you do try. defiantly wipe really well before you get in that might help a lil.
My best friend has baths on her period, she uses natural organic bubble bath and essential oils. Yes, her blood does go in the water, but just use the shower head to wash it away afterwards
Grapes. No 'added' sugar; just fructose.
frozen mangos without added sugar are delicious, as is frozen blueberries or strawberries
different nuts and seeds are good. Beef jerky maybe, dried fruit. also fresh fruits and veggies.
Nuts are good
me an my girl friend have recently been do sexual activities an im never fully erect but any other time im hard as a rock but at the same time my penis is different when we do it other than when im by myself when we do it my penis is not as long but really thick but when im alone its long but not as thick.......whats wrong with me?
Performance anxiety -- just need to relax and not be self conscious about having sex and certainly wear condoms.
Sensitivity. Basically you know how to stimulate and pleasure yourself more so when your expectation doesnt reach you will not gain much erection.
you are conditioned to wan king
I had a root canal. I didn't contract any disease or sickness. In fact it's still there 20 years later. You are over reacting. You can have it pulled if you want, too...but just know you have options, no matter what your dentist says. I have done Both.
I would go ahead with the root canal. You can always research the oral surgeon before hand so you feel more comfortable. My mom just got a root canal about a year ago and she has had no problems at all.
Its 2016 im sure root canals are safe now
I've had a few. Not a big deal. Tooth pain is the worst (maybe 2nd to kidney stones) so it was worth it. This isn't a recommendation one way or the other, just an anecdote.
Ummm, this decision is best made eith your dentist, not random strangers on Yahoo.
Much better shave with a straight razor as far as being smooth and close. An electric razor is about the worst thing you can shave with.
Sure, a straight razor- or regular manual razor for that matter will give a closer shave than an electric.
most barbers in my area havent offered shaves since the AIDS outbreak in the 80's
People can say yes or no but, only you will know by going and having it done. You'll love the whole experience of hanging with the guys... conversations, joking, etc.
Is having someone wash your car for you better than you washing your car yourself? That depends on how well each of you or at washing a car.
That's average.
Adult average size, so no problem down there. Problem is all up in your head, thinking you need to be bigger. But same size as about 60% of all males.
At 17 you might get some girth probably finished length. < M
Tie a rock on it.
no, you are not virgin because of it.
If you shaved it can happen. The hair follicle gets infected. You can put a hot pack on it several times a day to make it go away faster.
Might want to see a doctor. Could be a cyst or boil if it's big.
Did you shave? They're likely ingrown hairs.
You should go see a doctor about it

There's nothing in the information you've given that suggests that you are at any increased risk of any cancer at all. Cancer is rarely hereditary; fewer than 10% of cancer cases are hereditary. ancer diagnosed after the age of 50 is even less likely to be hereditary. A sign that cancer might (only might) be hereditary is when several members of the same side of a family have had the same type of cancer, especially if some developed it at a younger than usual age. Two second-degree relatives, unrelated to each other, having had cancer doesn't increase your risk
There are many things that people can do to prevent cancer. Get rid of any foods that are processed with cancer causing ingredients, like MSG. Avoid using cannned foods due to the BPA in the can lining. Everyone should do the homework on cancer prevention. Your immune system is your first line of defense against cancer, so by all means keep your immune system strong. Watch a series on YouTube called, 'The Truth About Cancer'. It's loaded with information that will help.
No. Most cancers are not inherited and it takes an extensive history of he same cancer in many family members to indicate a genetic link.
One with breast and one with bowel doesn't give it a hereditary factor..
Sounds like your risk is no different from the average person.
Not unless it is genetic and your mum then got cancer
I do really well during the week and look forward to a cheat day on the weekend.
Motivation is not an exact science. What may work for you might not help somebody else. That said, I recommend getting Jesus involved through prayer. In Gospel of John chapter 21, He feeds the disciples a meal of fish (a good source of protein) and bread. So enjoy a tuna sandwich and talk to the Lord in prayer about your concerns.
Do goal setting. Commit fully. Get someone to help motivate and encourage you.
I do feel as if Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea works for the long term. I started using it about a month ago. I stopped using it for a couple of weeks due to an illness I got, and did not gain back even 1 pound of weight. I have now begun use again, and it’s working great. I am pleased with it, and even more pleased by the fact that it doesn't give me any negative side effects.
"kyross522" is right. You can be a little chubby and still be in good enough shape to run and stuff. Maybe do more of that of you feel you are getting too chubby. Remember, some people just weigh more than others. Usually when they are the same height those that are heavier are the people with bad diets. You aren't fat at your current weight. Take care to keep it that way.
I'm 5'8" and 160lbs and am pretty healthy. I've always been a little chubby but I'm in good shape and run and stuff. Some people just weigh more than others. You aren't fat at all. Trust me
You are fine for your height. If you gained 10 pounds or so that would be okay too.
that seems like a healthy weight. if anything youre too skinny
Considering that your masturbation doesnt interfere your social life, your school or other stuff, masturbation is normal and not to worry about it.
You're an early developer. Unless it interferes with anything else, such as homework, socialising with friends and family, external activities, etc. then there's nothing at all wrong with the number of times you masturbate. Keep well hydrated, and obviously, IF you catch colds, etc. then avoid JO-ing off. You may find it gradually lessens as you grow older. The other caution I'd make, is that you try not to fall into the same-old routine, cos that can easily lead to boredom. Explore Jackinworld for different techniques and ways to have fun, safely.
I certainly hope so, when I was your age I was at it 5-6 times a day.
So? I'm a highlsnder and I Jack off 12times an hour
Thats fine
It's unlikely that you'll have any significant further growth in your height. Growth charts stop tracking boys at age 20, although growth of more than 1 cm are uncommon after age 18. Most likely your parents are short, and you've inherited their height.
At your age it's not likely, but it's possible still. You're just running out of time very fast. Males typically reach their completed height by age 18 or 19.
No. Men stop round 16
Well you could be. Some guys end puberty in their late teens while others still grow until their early twenties. Time will tell.
Most likely - no. healthy-relationship-dating.com/how-tal...

No
That's my guess. The dude is a total fraud in my opinion, just like the rest of that family.
he is a shame for his daugthers if he has been doing all this for fame. Maybe because he always was a ****** but the producers told him that turning into a tranny will make him more famouse than kris and kim. Actualy i did became more famous than the hoes. The next step of the ****** will be the one who keep him on the public eye.
He's still a man with a Disk Tracy.

Love it, first time in a long time I've taken supplement that seems to be as accurate as it's description. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is really great as a pre-workout or for a natural energy booster throughout the day. I've only been taking them for a few days but impressed enough to purchase another supply .
It depend on how fast your lose the weight. If you lose the weight fast than yes you will have loose skin or saggy skin. But if you take it slow, eating right, and not in a rush to lose weight gradually than you won't have those issues.
Not if you lose it slowly and intelligently: You can lose 10 lbs/mo this way: Avoid junk food, greasy food, starches, carbs, sodas, coffee and alcohol in all forms. Stick with fresh fruits and veggies, salads, eggs, chicken, fish, turkey, fruit/yogurt smoothies and lots of water. Good luck!
LOL, no. That only happens if someone is over age 60.
If there was a simple answer to this very difficult question, depression would not be such an issue. Often people do not have any idea when others are depressed so if you open up to friends, family, or counsellors and explain why you are feeling the way you are they might actually understand and want to help you. Do not hesitate to ask for help or worry about your parents laughing at you because no matter what they are concerned for your safety and suicide is no joke.
Start by going to see your school counselor or nurse. Maybe they can help you figure out good ways to talk to your parents so that you can get help.
boohoo, poor you.
It's normal to jerk off if your in a relationship or not up to as many times a day as you can, that's not the issue, your a young guy an it's fine, but it does seem like your relationship is the problem, get out of it an u might be much happy with your sex life
Yeah, well your gf does not attract you any more. May not be her fault. but whatever you need to be turned on = she ain't doing it for you. I think it would be sensible for you both to go separate ways and find a mate. Unlikely you are addicted = this is fairly normal sexual response. Also from your spelling, I'd guess you are Indian, so there may be a cultural factor. < M
This shows ur mental ailment and less strength to satisfy ur GF
If you cook the vegetables no. If you eat them raw possibly but unlikely. Raw meat is not poison it just carries the risk of bacterial infection.
Most likely you are fine, but there is no way we can know for sure. Certainly good health practices were not followed in this kitchen.
Well you could be exposed to germs (some of them nasty), but if you feel well, then count yourself lucky and forget about it
If you don't feel sick soon, you are okay.
no your not
I'm 13 and my sleeping pills are almost gone. I have enough for about two more days. The reason I take them is because I have ocd so it's really hard for me to fall asleep. Before people say there unhealthy these are all natural ones btw. I need help getting off of them because I don't want to rely on them my entire life. I have tried to sleep without them but I can't. When I tried I ended up sleeping like at 1:00 am and I had school the next. Day Can someone comment tips or things I can do to help. Thanks in advance :))
try putting lavender oil on your pillow and have a bubble bath before bed. so relaxing things, turn your light off, turn your phone off. read a book or watch a calming tv show, i like to watch david attenborough before bed. i hope this helps :)
Tell a dr. how you feel; there are good meds for OCD. Meantime, drink hot cocoa before bed, soak in a warm bath, take melatonin (otc), and go to sleep early.

Performance anxiety and pressure from the girl. You need to see a urologist for some help with this issue as it is mostly psychological. A short term medication may be the answer (and quite frankly, a different girl that does not DEMAND that you perform).
My husband was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme package! Neither he nor I were disappointed. He has been taking the recommended dosage of one tablet a day. Within a few days we both noticed the difference. Sex is more pleasurable for both of us! He is able to last longer, and his size has increased in both thickness and length. He also has an increased desire for sex. honestly, I was skeptical that these would work, but we were both pleasantly surprised!
Sounds like simple performance anxiety and need to just get past that.
What to do when you think your sick: 1) Describe the symptoms to people at work and get their opinions 2) post questions on Yahoo Answers 3) see a doctor and get an accurate diagnosis. This of course is a last resort if co-workers and anonymous strangers can't help.
You should see a doctor. Get regular tests. No more unprotected sex especially since you suspect being exposed to something. Worry won't help. It can cause symptoms just like a placebo can make symptoms go away without explanation. In other words, you could be making yourself sick. See a doctor. Get tested. Follow your doctor's schedule and advice.
There is no way you would have full blown AIDS with symptoms in two weeks!!! The only way to know for sure is to get blood work. You will need to repeat this from time to time.
Up to you- some guys like using condoms to avoid the mess, and all guys should do it some anyway to know how a condom will feel when having protected sex.
Gets to expensive using a condom each time. Condoms are made for safe sex
It's easier to masturbate without wearing a condom.
why waste a condom
Please see http://www.circinfo.com/post-op_care/car... for very useful advice on the post-op care of your new circumcision. Your problem is due to the large amount of swelling of your penis at this time. As the swelling subsides you will stop having this problem. If really concerned about any aspect of healing then always consult your doctor for reassurance.
Give it a little bit longer, and if it does not heal more correctly, then do what kelvin said go back and ask your doctor.
Just look at the pee hole, spread the "lips' and see what the obstruction is- might just be some debris of some sort you just wipe out with your finger.
The reputation is true, but really exaggerated. Asians eat tons of soy and you don't see lots of asian men with breasts. Soy does have small amounts of estrogen, but your body also even produces estrogen. So eating soy products occasionally won't have much effect on a guy's masculinity.
Soy products are known to increase estrogen levels in males. That is a medical fact. It affects different males more so than others
Soy does contain plant based Estrogen, but one would have to consume an inordinate amount of it for it to even begin to have an adverse effect.
lmao. You'd have to consume GALLONS of soy for it to begin to even affect you in that way.

Most have two, although some have only one and some have none at all. In rare cases a human might have three legs. Like Franceso Lentini. He had a conjoined twin brother, who comprised only a leg and a set of genitals. So Frank had three legs and two sets of genitals. This is a true story - but the bit about a twin brother who was composed of only a leg and a willy is quite hard to believe, or to read without giggling. It also poses an interesting philosophical question, can a person be a person if they are only made up of a leg and a willy?

You have a yeast infection or bv. It's normal and can be treated. A yeast infection can be treated with OTC meds. And bv would require a doctors visit since they have to give you antibiotics.
1) You don't have herpes 2) Birth control is protection from pregnancy 3) Go to the gyno. It may be BV. The fishy odor being a hint to that. It's nothing to be freaked out by.

Normally I'm really happy and never let anything get me down. But for the past few months I've felt so distant, and I've lost all interest in everything. I broke up with my boyfriend, my friends have no interest in hanging out with me, they've all gone their separate ways (started having kids) so no one is around. I'm really shy so I find it hard talking to people. I'm at the point where I've started drinking more and eating less and I really don't care what happens to me now. I want to be happy again but that seems so impossible. What can I do?
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
you should see a psychiatrist and a psychologists. it sounds like depression. you shouldn't wait cause it could get worse and i don't know but i feel like it can manifest into something much worse. tell someone really close to you and if your ex still cares about you try to talk to him. you could talk to your parents too if you have any. i hope you find something that helps and makes you feel better byee ^.^
During absorption and digestion, the carbohydrates in the food you eat are reduced to their simplest form, glucose. Excess glucose is then removed from the blood, with the majority of it being converted into glycogen, the storage form of glucose, by the liver’s hepatic cells via a process called glycogenesis.
You are thinking of Pancreas. Secretes insulin to deal with sugar levels.

Cough syrup or cough drops or see a doctor
Cough drops.
cough drops will help. Tea, honey, and rest will help as well. Also, small doses of zinc can help cure colds in certain people
Robutussin will help quite a bit. It's over the counter too.
Because liberals have this notion that it is better to accept reality and the truth, whatever it is. Guess they have the silly idea that if reality does not fit their agenda, they should amend their agenda.
conservatives believe in science that is done by and paid for by big businesses in a fashion that only promotes the big business. The rest of the world supports science that is peer reviewed, able to be replicated, tested, and verified.
Because if you only believe science when it suits your agenda, then you are approaching science from a religious view point.
Example please.
What the heck does "no homo" mean. Weird thing to say. But average adult penis size is 5.16 inches. Only about 12% of all men are 6.2 inches or larger, less than 5% are 7 inches or more. And no, most guys are not 8-9 inches since less than 1% are 8 inches or more.
Medical journals say the average length for an adult male is between 4" and 6" erect. It is kind of like a guy who says he has caught a huge fish but has no proof. Also, being overweight prevents a portion of your penis to not stick out as far. Skinnier men have more of their penis visible.
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
No, it has to be under 5 inches erect to be considered small.
dont believe everything you hear
Therapy will help with your worries. I browsed your past questions online and they don't see too bad. Nothing is private online. If that gives you anxiety then schedule your therapy session for more than once a week. Also take a break from being online and live in the real world.

I m extremely prone to yeast infections even as a young preteen I would get them really bad. I never really worried much until now because I ve had 2 in under 2 months. I recently got tested and I m clean so I ruled that out. I don t use harsh soaps because of the same reason, I did use a douche within the last week, I hope it s just a yeast infection and nothing worse.. I have done everything I can.. Creams, home remedies, maybe Doctor is next ? I get this horrible discomfit inside of my vagina, what has anyone done that helped them?
If your discharge is like cttage cheese its a yeast infection and it does cause itching. They sell "MONOSTAT" at grocery store.That will fx you up. If that doesn't work it might be Bacterial vaginitis, Nthing serious. Too much bactria. It would smell bad.And youd have to go the doctor fr that. Try the other stuff first. Ive had your probem since I was 15. It can be common as we are delicate creatures.
Are you using douches bought over the counter? If so, this is counter productive. They are full of chemicals, not natural, and can destroy the natural bacteria which keeps your vagina clean and healthy.... if you have to douche use apple cider vinegar (1/2) cup to a quart of warm water. This is a neutralizer and does not destroy the good bacteria. You also said you're prone to yeast infections and if so, you ought to know the symptoms by now, right? Since you already tried the creams (i'm assuming miconazole based) see the doctor. Let him know you tried the creams.
Nothing you can do without a doctor. No creams, no home remedies, I have the same issue. nothing works. Yes. It sounds very much like a yeast infection....see your doctor.
Tell her to go easy. Some soup, toast...water. Then if her stomach can handle it a bit of canned fruit. She should go easy for a few days.
What did her doctor say she should eat? Usually, doctors will tell you. I think soup would be nice.
If her doctors have not told her, she needs new doctors. Generally soups and things; but I'm not her medical provider.
Crackers and chicken broth

Really, it depends upon the age of the man and his experience. Young guys are faster than older guys. At least 15 minutes is desirable. After about 20 or so it seems more like a chore for both of you. We usually have sex for 15 minutes or so. William, you are joking. Either that, or you have no female who wants to have sex with you. What's the rush, dude?
The average time? Approximately 4 seconds.
Generally speaking an experienced man can go on average 5 to 7 min of actual intercourse.
Following genital penetration, 6 to 10 minutes is common. Too short and your partner is unlikely to be satisfied. Too long, and it's a chore that everyone gets bored with.
1 1/2 hours to 2 hours.
I told you already - some of us can go for half an hour or more, while others last about two minutes.
Average what?
LOL. No such thing. Learn...(practice) healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
all depends if he's rushing it or taking his time
I can trust you with my secrets right? Alright well I've been masturbating a LOT lately, and by lately I mean the past month or so I've been masturbating anywhere from 2-4 times a day and my penis was already hurting from all of that. But I just got out of the shower and my left testicle is HUGE compared to my right testicle. Like nearly 4 times bigger. There was pain in that area but I can't tell right now because I took a powerful pain killer for post-workout. Obviously I'm going to quit cold turkey but please tell me how to find out if this is cancer or if its just swelling from excessive masturbation?
Cancer does not usually swell THAT fast. You "might" have hydrocele but you need doctor's diagnosis not mine. 4 times a day is not usually lethal at 21. Give it a rest for coupla days, see doctor if still swollen. < M
Could be an infection, just see the doctor and say you've got swelling and pain. Don't mention the masturbation as that is unlikely to be the cause
cancer does not suddenly appear- more likely you have a fluid build up due to leakage or other swelling. See a urologist if it is that big.
It has nothing to do with masturbation and I think you should get to a doctor in case it is serious.
Actually, it's the other way around: It's bad to be a pothead if you workout.
It isn't bad to workout unless your heart or other parts of your body are not healthy enough for exercise, which is usually only associated with rigorous exercise
It's bad to be a pothead, period. Get your life together.
No I smoke weed on the daily. I also find myself with food in my hand constantly. Which made me work out I love it and when I get done I'll smoke a fatty and be satisfied!
No. There's nothing wrong with staying in shape...
Yep, you might die.
Yes it is the caffeine that does it. Quite helpful actually if you are ever constipated. :) Even decaf coffee does the job with a handful of chocolate.
Caffeine is a stimulant (not a laxative), so it stimulates all the processes in your body to speed up a bit (heart rate, metabolism, etc) briefly, so that combined with the fact that most people drink it warm/hot, is conducive to having a bowel movement soon after having some. LOTS of people poop shortly into, or after, their morning cup of hot coffee. ☺
yes
Yes, it does the same to me.
I am 40 years old and the people in my HS that were beautiful now look like Hell and the average people are now very beautiful. I do not know of many people that did not think they were ugly including myself. Just look around and you will see that the "beautiful people" are not so beautiful inside. You will be fine.
When I got very hard hit in the testicles I had first agonizing sharp pain and some seconds after the pain intensified and deepened into my both testicles. The pain in the testes was so severe that I was near a shock and I needed instant hospital treatment.
Doubt anyone on this forum can tell you first hand. But most guys have been racked in the balls and most likely it hurts like that if not worse.

I have had a wierd mole on my back for years. But it seems like it sometimes my back hurts near the mole. its upper left by my shoulder blade. thats been going on for a year. now i have been having some breathing problems. but i also have a severe allergy problem and i don't know if i'm having chest pain because of the allergy or because i have cancer. for the past week i have been having joint pain throughout my body. does this mean i'm dying? I'm freaking out i don't know whats wrong with me.
Step 1 should be to put tobacco on your back, if something is wrong like cancer, if your genes are receptive to antigens and immunogens, it will make your own body kill it. If there is nothing wrong with you, it won't do anything and your body will flush out the chemicals. Take it from a guy whose gallbladder has ruptured twice and is still alive. You probably don't have a clue that tobacco has been used as medicine for thousands of years, yeah that's right thousands of years and it is biologically active against melanoma. You need to look closely at this, scroll down to the bottom of the page. https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index...
Cancer is something that when it hits, you'll end up in the hospital because you wouldn't be able to deal with the pain. If your mole stays the same texture/color then nothing is wrong with it. Chest pain could be due to a lot of things like anxiety for ex.
Step 1 is see a dr and ask them to check your mole. Any mole that changes should be cheched. Most are not a problem. Step 2 ask about shoulder pain. Step 3 ask about respiratory issue. Step 4 ask about joint pain. All of these steps can occur in a single dr visit. I am guessing you fave a virus.
A trip to the dermatologist will determine if your mole is to blame.

Never ever use super glue on your glasses. It simply doesn't work and in your case you would only end up getting the glue on the lens and it can't be removed so you would be getting new glasses. "naruto is very wrong. You don't even have to go back to where you got your glasses from. Any optical shop will be more than happy to fix your glasses for you at no charge.
I got new glasses today and I noticed the lens is slightly popped out on one side. I don't want it to fall out. How can I fix it at home?
Take your glasses back to where you got them. Usually most will be happy to fix them at no cost to you.
DO NOT use glue. DO NOT try to fix it at home. Go back with them.
super glue, or just take it to your nearest eye glasses shop and they'll fix it for you
When i'm not doing anything with my schlong I notice it's naturally leaning to the left, wether i'm sitting on the toiler or lying down naked on my bed. Is there any natural reason for this? Why doesn't it lean to the right? Is this something like the case of dominant-handedness where some men have their penises leaning left and some leaning right?
For some reason most guys find their penis swings to the left. Some say it is because most guys masturbate with their right hand which causes it to curve or swing weft curve but I doubt it.
Youre right, some penis point to the left others to the right, some points downward while others upwards... Its position depends on how you used to place your penis. My penis point downward as it is the way i used to but at 15 i was circumcised so i decided to point it upward... Now it is as normal as i could feel.
At least your penis hangs or leans. Those of us with very short penises, ours only pokes out a little bit and isn't long enough to hang down or lean anywhere
Just how you are hung, and can be any reason- even how your balls rest -since most guys the lower part of the penis rests on the scrotum much of the time.
What you are describing is Stage III or IV cancer. And just like with all cancers, it is harder to treat, but each cancer is different. Some respond well to treatment, even when advanced, some are very difficult to treat in a more advanced stage. Cancer is not one thing, but a collection of over 200 individual diseases that share common characteristics.
Whether a doctor sees the cancer or not has NO bearing on the severity or presence of the cancer. If a cancerous body has metastatisized to other places, the odds are good that it is too late for our treatments to help. Diagnosis = identifying. NOT condemnation.
There really isn't an answer. It depends on the type of cancer, where it has spread to and how aggressive it is.
depends on what type of cancer it is
You should go to the doctor either way and get checked. The sooner the better.
for 1 month ive been having pain in my lungs and my doctor told me(1 month ago) that they are fine. but lately I still have pain also feel like throwing up. I cant sleep because im scared it might be cancer. my mom told me it might be an acid problem. ive never felt like this. Please only serious answers. do I have cancer im 22
Cancer can't be diagnosed just from pain alone. Many things in the body cause pain. In order for cancer to be diagnosed, a doctor would need to find evidence of abnormally replicating cells in your body. Many (but not all) cancers manifest themselves as tumors, which are abnormal lumps on the body. If you do a self-examination and find lumps, have a doctor check them out to see if they are cancerous. If you don't have any lumps, there are lots of possibilities as to what could be causing your pain. You and your doctor would have to work through the various possibilities (one possibility being acid reflux, as your mother said) and eliminate them one by one.
Sounds like indigestion Health anxiety questions belong in Mental health, not cancer. People in cancer are dealing with life threatening illnesses, not imagination
You would needs scans and xrays to find out but sounds more like acid reflux so take an antacid and see if it helps and avoid spicy foods.
Hypochondria, you're ridiculous.
ERs miss a lot of things...and diagnose a lot of things as the reason when it's not. Definitely follow up with either an orthopedist or your regular doctor.
I think I'd go to a different hospital emergency room. They sound like a bunch of idiots. You should have at least gotten some pain meds. I really think I'd seek further medical treatment, just not there.
You should seriously make another appointment with your real doctor and get another x-ray. An orthopedic surgeon may be useful to see too.
So i went to the dentist after like 5 years(don't have insurance) and iv'e been wanting braces, after my visit the dentist gave me a whole list of what i need to get done, and its a lot! it all came to the average price of braces! I do need to get a root canal done on my front tooth and get a crown on that tooth which id what im ganna get done first..but anyways can I just get that done and then get braces? then after theyre straight can i fix the rest?
If your teeth are in bad shape i.e. rotting or unhealthy you may spend a ton of money on braces and when you get them off a bunch of your teeth fall out. Braces straighten your teeth, but they do not improve the health of your teeth. I would talk to the dentist about it and see what he or she says but most likely you need the work done to get your teeth in a healthier condition before worrying about straightening them, good luck!
A good orthodontist won't put braces on teeth that have cavities (depending on where the cavity is the brackets might not adhere to the decay or the ortho appliance could make it much harder for the dentist to fill them).
Dental work comes first, but if it can wait and you need that much dental wotk, get insurance first
Yes
Yes. I m sad that this is even a question. Ever heard of left-overs?
Probably not if you didn't refrigerate it
If it was in the fridge, sure. If it was not, no.
I am not a doctor but it sounds like urine mixing with your semen. Try using the washroom prior to masturbating and see if the issue continues. If so, you may want to seek a professional opinion as it could be something more severe.
Nothing to do, normal for semen to be clear, white, gray or even yellowish.
Could be the foods your eating and whether ur on medication or not? Does it smell
give it time to change on it's own
Its probably your pee bro i think you should see a doctor.
That is piss not semen.....
What you are doing.
Don't listen to the other answers. You are in excessive pain because you haven't worked out in a while. I always feel like that once I stop working out for 3-4 weeks on end. But yeah, take a break for your body to heal. You should feel better on the next workout.
Your trainer is an inexperienced idiot who is going to hurt you if you stay with him or her. He had you start with an advanced program when, basically, you are a beginner again. He had you do a lot more than you should have done and not, for over training, you are paying the price. Tell the gym owner and manger what happened because that trainer will eventually hurt someone who will sure the trainer and the gym for letting him or her work there and mislead the clients. Go online, find a good three, non-consecutive days training programs that works the full body. Start light and work into it.
No, excessive pain is not normal. You are overdoing it! Take a day off then go back. You need to recover. I suggest you reduce the weight you are using. If you hurt that bad lower your stress and repetitions. Work up slowly! Also, make sure you drink water, and eat a good quality protein meal afterwards to help recover.
Please read the pdf provided. https://www.acsm.org/docs/brochures/dela... It is called delayed onset muscle soreness (doms) and can occur 1 to 2 days after a workout. When you haven't worked out in a long time - people can overdo it. Best to wait a few days before working out again. Take Advil or ibuprofen.
Take a break. Take some advil, and a bath with epsom salt. It's helps with DOMS
never, only if you are injured
*: ･ﾟ✧ Hi from France ✧ﾟ ･:* (Je suis Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Bruxelles / I'm Charlie, Paris, San Bernardino & Bruxells) Don't worry, root canal is not painful, since they do an anesthesia of the tooth. It's nothing. I had many root canals in my life. ~~ Have a nice day ~~ Cat.

No, but it can be improved and you need more veggies. You are eating too much of the same grain too. Keep grains to 1-2 servings a day and don't eat the same thing. Also pick one fruit at a meal, don't do two.
Keep an eye on your weight and if it starts to go up over a length of time then you are eating too much compared to your energy usage.
Ooh, that's a lot of food. It sounds like you're eating too much for one day. If you keep on eating like that every day you'll gain a lot of weight. You should spread that amount of food over two days. Good luck and stay healthy :)
I am going to purchase eyeglasses with progressive lenses. The optical store near me said they only stock Zeiss for progressive lenses since they are top quality and have the best options, meaning their scratch resistant option uses a better technology than other glasses, and their transition technology is excellent too. I did a web search for lens ratings but all I find are lens company sites, online eyeglass stores, and personal reviews (which are usually rants from dissatisfied customers. Are Zeiss top quality? I need lenses for computer work and photography work, so it's important I get good glasses.
Zeiss is a pretty good brand. I know because I'm an optician and I sell them at work all the time and know a lot about the quality of the lens. I've never had a patient I've sold to complain about Zeiss. They have a new lens that is high definiton. it would be very good for computer work and anything else you need the glasses for.
Yes high quality.
I don't think people think this through. If we throw out our traditional christian values from government what replaces them? Most would say humanism which is essentially atheism. The problem with this is that morals and values become relative with no asolutes and subject to the ever changing views of society. This leads to perversion and destruction.
The 0bama Jarrett Administrations values are Communism, they want to destroy our culture, destroy our traditions and allow Radical Islam into America instead.
If you want our government to uphold Christ's values of feeding the hungry and healing the sick and helping the poor, then that's great. If you want government to praise Jesus in government activities, then that's not good. If you want government to kill infidels for their religious beliefs just like in the crusades, than that's not good, either. Your description of moral relativism is based on a poor understanding of humanism. We can make laws against murder, which happens to be a Christian value, and a Jewish value, and a humanist value, without saying, "OK, time to enact all the Christian values because we happen to do something that aligns with that Christian value".
It seems the people who try and govern by Christian Values are just using the personal values of themselves and trying to pass them off as Christian. Separation of church and state is a most valuable tradition to a nation.
The values of the people in general.
American values. Is this a trick question? The answer seems so obvious.
Hi the average male has these issues alter time. the average male penis if 5.5 inches in length it usually has a girth of 1 and half inches. as it only takes a 2 inch penis to make a female pregnant what is the point of having anything longer or bigger. so yes you have more than mister average so there should be no problems sexual positions do make a lot of difference when both are over weight.
1) Tape round widest part 2) Probably not. 3) 4.7 inches is average. most experienced women can grip a pencil. < M
Take it to a Gay Bar. If you want faster service, wear black leather.
Frequently that is due to vitamin C deficiency. In extreme cases its called scurvy and people have died from it. Eat more vitamin c containing food or take a supliment. IF you still have gum bleeding see a doctor.
Use a electric toothbrush. Ask your dentist your question.
you most likely have gingivitis and need to floss your teeth daily and have a professional cleaning. at the dentist.
does it bleed usually when you brush your teeth ?
vitamin deficiency ?
vitamin c.
the plan: 1/2 of the plate is fruits n veggies; 1/4 is protein and 1/4 is rice or maybe lesser.
Not if you eat Brown Rice.
No, only if you eat too much of it. Eating too much of anything will make you fat, including eating too much of healthy foods such as veggies and protein.
depends on how much you eat
many people masturbate and have sex several times a day, others once a week or even less. The short answer is as often as you want or need
Well, Masturbation IS solo sex-- as it is the same physiological act as sexual intercourse. Just using a hand instead of a vagina. For teens average rate is daily, and older guys still generally have sex one way or the other (a or b) 3-5 times a week. Guys should have sex as often as they have the urge, what we are designed to do.
I've read that there are serious studies showing that men who ejaculate more often, have less prostate cancer risk. So men should probably have a daily ejaculation, either from sex or masturbation. Haven't heard anything about women.
as often as you want to
Check with your local Parish...
as often as they (a) want to and (b) find mutually agreeable with their partner
When they feel like it
Whenever they want to.
when the need ARISES
Finding out about cancer hardly ever starts at the hospital. I had pneumonia and was sent for a chest x-Ray. A week later, after the pneumonia passed there still was a shadowy area. I was then sent for a CAT scan and later an MRI. Blood work and lung tests all concluded that there was a mass. I was then scheduled for surgery. Once removed, a biopsy showed some malignancy and I decided to have radiation treatment. That was nearly 20 years ago! If you're co corned see your doctor. Catching it early...if it is cancer can totally save your life! Best of luck.
You would go to your family doctor if you have symptoms of illness. You should also go yearly for a check up to see what your blood work shows, what your blood pressure and pulse are and at some point you'd have a EKG or what ever test your doctor thinks are appropriate.
If you go to routine checkups, many times your bloodwork will show abnormalities. Other times cancer is not detected even for those who do go to the Dr. My advice is live life to the fullest and don't worry about something that probably isn't even true. If you have a concern, go to dr.
It's suggested you go get a physical every 1-2 years. they usually do a routine blood test, blood pressure test, oxygen levels, heart rate. Those cover most issues.
If you have advanced cancer you will be ill enough that you will see a doctor.
Long-term, if you have a malignant tumour you will go to hospital.
You will become so sick that you will have to see a doctor and by then it could be too late
Just swalloy a camera
By your own Doctor.
Yes.
I don't know yet, every time I think I'm at my lowest it only gets worse.
yes
Instead of causing a miscarriage, think of alternative ways in which to raise a child. You could put a baby up for adoption if you are too young to raise a child. There are no safe ways to have a miscarriage because there will always be damage psychologically. I won't give you a spiel on "too young to raise a child too young to make one" because you seem to already feel bad enough and at least you are acknowledging that you two are too young to raise a child.
No, and any attempt could either harm you or the fetus. You could give birth to a baby with all kinds of problems.
No, there isn't. You can injure yourself or worse. Abortion and adoption are options. There are people who want children and will pay your expenses. Or you could have the baby and drop it off at a hospital. http://www.wikihow.com/Drop-Off-an-Unwanted-Baby
You need to go to the doctor, or you may not have kids later when you want them. What did you think was going to happen when you had sex?
If there were any, that were guaranteed to work, no one would ever bother with birth control or abortion, would they?
No, definitely not.
No.
Maybe do a diary tomorrow and keep count of how many glasses you do have, the next day do the same but drop it by two, and the day after again drop it by another two. Slowly but surely until you get to one or two, one or two isn't so bad, soda contain a lot of sugars so u may drop a little weight but as you drop the soda maybe increase your physical activity by 15 mins each day and when u hit two glasses a day increase it by 30 mins and you should notice a difference. Even lowering your portion size of food will drastically help. Eat what you like but drop the amount. Good luck
15 GLASSES a day is an immense amount of calories. cut that out and dont replace it with anything and you should loose weight
Have fifteen glasses of water a day, instead
yes
yup
This will sound harsh, but you need to get off of Yahoo Answers and take your daughter to a doctor/therapist. At 85 lbs, she is severely underweight. There is nothing wrong with working out and being fit, but you have to feed your body to fuel it for those workouts. Lack of eating is classic anorexia. No one here can help you, your daughter needs face-to-face personal help.
You tell her she needs help and she declines? If she broke her leg and you told her she needed to go to the hospital and she said no would you let her make that decision? If she became very ill and she needed medication and she said she would not take it would you let her refuse? If she started smoking and doing drugs you would allow that? All of these are just as detrimental to her health and well being. Schedule an appointment with her doctor and discuss the possibility of a referral to a specialist that deals with teens and eating disorders.
Yes, she is on a very bad place, that's pretty much textbook anorexia. 85 lbs at her height is grossly underweight, and with a bunch of exercise piled on, she's in danger of dying to be 100% honest. She doesn't get to decline help at this point. You force her to start therapy, etc.
Take her to a doctor ASAP. She would probably have to go on some kind of medication or hypnosis. Also if it helps, tell her to look at herself and make sure she realises what shes doing to herself (this is just my advice).
See a Doctor before it is too late.
sounds like the beginning of anorexia too me and you need to talk to her about the change
Normal haha
It's only possible in the troll universe that you live in.
This is a physical impossibility, troll.
Air in the rectum can cause air embolism and death,
Yes they can. See it's you who are privileged to receive the prescription... no doctor anywhere is required to give you drugs for any reason. I assume you lied about using pot.... If you don;t choose to give up pot, then find a doctor that doesn't care if you smoke it... not all psychiatrists care. But it's dangerous for you to combine prescriptions drugs with street drugs. Make sure your doctor is aware of any street drugs that you use so that they can adjust your prescribed medication accordingly.
A doctor is never required to refill a prescription. Your drug use messes up the other medication, which is also addictive. He won't know if you are getting better because of your drug use. Stop using.
your not supposed to smoke weed when your on those and if you do your condition might get worse and what he did was right
Sadly Yes...this is a new thing now, that is why they do urine tests now before prescribing your usual medication.
Yes.
Yes, especially the klonopin because it has the potential for abuse.
When I drink Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea #in the morning, it curbs my appetite, reduces my cravings, and gives me more energy! This tea also keeps me going to the bathroom regularly instead of going 3-4 times a week.I lost the pounds and even more (28 pounds total)! I have just ordered the new bottles from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea
Skipping meals is one of the worst things you can do, I would recommend just eating healthier meals for lunch and lay off carbs such as peanut butter and Bread. Every day go on a jog or walk until you feel comfortable jogging/ sprinting. If you are in need or more help just do some online research.
For every 3,500 calories that you eat, you gain 1 pound. For every 3,500 calories that you burn off, you lose 1 pound. Keep track of how many calories you eat each day and how many calories you burn off each day. Eat foods with less fat in them since each gram of fat is 9 calories. Eat foods with more carbs and protein in them since each gram of carbs and protein is only 4 calories. Make sure that you're burning off more calories each day than you consume and you'll gradually lose weight. If you want to speed up the process, eat slightly less each day and exercise for 30 - 60 minutes a few times a week.
Starvation does not work. It in fact slows weight loss. Eat right and exercise daily.
BBQ is the best!! I used to get them from planned parenthood but that got ruined... now I have to buy them on the street. I have no idea whether or not I'm getting quality baby....
Since you find that they are delicious to eat there is nothing weird with eating babies particularly jelly babies. Enjoy!
More than weird
It's kinky, but I had to try it myself... it makes me really violent, actually.
I really want to die but everyone keeps wanting me to live even if they don t know me. I need to get people to realize that I do not deserve to live. Some arguments I have are people who want to live can use my organs and I have been rejected by over 140 women consecutively. Please do not talk me out of this. I am in constant pain and my life is going no where.
Suicide is never justified. I have been in a mental hospital 10+ times, and I would know that there is no justification and that therapy can definitely help.
There is no justification for suicide. Suicide is the last option. Don't give up. Go to counselling
Why do you seek justification? It's not like you are going to care what people think afterwards?
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft if you are at least 16. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
THERE WILL NEVER BE AN EXCUSE FOR SUICIDE. Why end your life when there are people struggling to live everyday. People who are sick and still fighting to get a cure and fighting to live longer to be with their families they love. A lot of people will pray to even have at least a day to live just to be with people who care for them. Life is so precious to just go to waste and end it.
yes you are still growing. At stop worrying about it most people are average sized anyway and its not what you have but how you learn to use it. Some women like big guy some don't at 15 your too young to worry about this you'll find someone in your life that you are happy with and she will be happy with you.
Your penis size is perfectly normal and fine for your age. It will probably get bigger because of your age since growth occurs until the ages of 16 to 17.
sure it will hopefully be 6 1/4 inches by the time you are 16
I have acne Scars and only 2 tiny pimples, i heared this Grounded Coffee with honey face scrub is amazing? A lot of people used it and loved it, so i tried and i use it once q week and it really really feels amazing and makes my skin so soft! But it makes my skin so red.. :/ and sometimes it gets a bit itchy but its not annoying me that much but i don t know if its okay to continue or stop it and try another face scrub? I want my marks to fade away
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
stop using it if it makes your skin red and itchy; that means it is either too strong for your skin or you are developing an allergy. acne scars generally do not go away by using a face scrub. a dermatologist M.D. might be able to treat them with facial peels.
I had light acne scarring between my chin and neck area. I used a lotion called bevoline and it got rid of my acne scars as well as my acne. It comes in a gey and blue box not expensive at all.
If your face is red and itchy then it would be best if you tried something else. For acne scars what is recommended it olive oil and baking soda used as a scrub.
Yes.
all that will do it get rid of dry skin - it won;t do anything for scars
Waste of time
It does nothing for you, it is extremely unhealthy mentally and physically if anything. Not sexually relieving yourself often and when you feel it is needed can lead to stress, increased blood pressure, anger, mood swings, prostate cancer, testicular cancer and ever mental diseases like OCD, ADD and GAD. Masturbation is a natural and important thing that 85 percent of the entire world does. If you are a teen and up. You should automatically be exploring your body. and I am glad you made the decision to "relapse" lol. Because masturbation isn't a drug. its part of life.
It does a whole lot for me!!!!!when I go long periods without fapping I get lots of attention from women especially older women plus my confidence sky rockets!! I could walk up to an attractive girl without feeling nervous and get her number even if she turns me down I won't give a *****
No reason there would be any benefits to not having regular solo sex; just seems a waste of some good self enjoyment.
Where did you get the idea that not masturbating would be any benefit at all? Masturbation is nothing more, nothing less than simple self pleasure. There are no benefits to masturbating, and there are no benefits to not masturbating.
You cannot see your sperm without a microscope, so I presume you really mean you don't have a flow of semen. The most usual cause of problems with semen production in the elderly is an enlarged prostate. You should see your doctor to get an appointment with a urologist who can check your prostate and do other tests to determine the cause of your problem.
No idea, you'd need to be examined by a urologist to see what the problem is.
How do you know? Have you been tested? You can't see sperm, so how would you know...
prostate problem. check them asap
the well is dry
You can't spot reduce so you'll need to lose weight and eventually it will come off there or if you are already in a healthy weight range and don't want to lose anymore weight then you can do a recomp with a structured lifting program.

My doctor is always pressuring me to get a pap smear. Today I asked if I could have a female do it. He went on and on about how the family doctor usually does it, how inconvenient it would be to be referred to a female gynecologist for this reason, and that there would probably be a six month wait. He repeated this about three times, but I told him that it's what I'd prefer. He finally threw his hands in the air and stormed out while muttering that he'd make a referral. This was very awkward, as he's normally very friendly and polite. Was I wrong to have insisted on having a female doctor perform my first pap smear?
I have been a practicing OB/GYN for over 30 years. As such, let me assure you that you have every right to insist on a physician with whom you are most comfortable. Many women feel exactly as you do. Frankly, your doctor acted irrationally, in my opinion. He should have simply made the referral and not have tried to change your mind. That was unprofessional as well as devoid of empathy. Again, you were right to demand what you want on this issue. Hope this helps and I wish you well.
i've never had a pap smear but i would prefer a woman to do it as well
because they see anything stupid to be good fun so they try it out. It's the same with smoking and because they start at a young age they feel that its good to boast about it and they get addicted to keep up expectations. I'm 15 and I smoke so I know how it feels although I have an E-cig now so I am getting back on track. The best way to know is through self experience
Because their brains are still developing as a teenager. Therefore, the younger the child tries alcohol, the more at risk he'll/she'll be to becoming an alcoholic. Same thing goes for drugs.
not sure, but if there is a lack of vision and hope for a better future. they will look for artificial satisfaction.
Whatever
Because they lack judgment and self control and they are impulsive and reckless....
Actually beacause its spellled nicoTEEN.
No. {You can take your own pulse.} You can buy a home-use monitoring machine. (It has a cuff attached.) The cuff is needed to temporarily stop the flow of blood. A medical person uses the stethoscope to know when that point is reached, and when flow restarts.
Most pharmacies have a blood pressure machine where you can take your blood pressure (no charge). Otherwise, it is impossible to get your blood pressure without a cuff and stethoscope.
A blood pressure machine u put the cuff on and hit state button and it takes it for u it explains how to put cuff on and alway has wrist monitors too. I own both
Go to your local Drug store or Wal*Mart. Most have machines that will read your BP
You can't.
There are two types, one for the wrist and one for the forearm. My druggist tells me the forearm is much more reliable.
You can;t.
No, that has never happened to anyone.
awesome, maybe now you'll finally STFU about it
😹
Lmaooooo!!!!!!!!
stop this myth
Im recovering from bulimia and it is not nice. I would make myself throw up for a whole year and know one knew except my sister. She kept my secret. Even 30 minutes in the room is fast enough, it started getting really depressing because i couldnt even keep the food in my mouth without spitting it out, i didnt want to BUT ANYWAYS, tell you mom and make sure she gets help :[ Now.
You need to tell you mom and dad and you guys need to sit down and get her health. Explain to her what fit vs thin is and that fit looks much better. As long as she eats protein she wont get fat just gain muscle in the right places. But you need to say something to your mom and do it in a very concerned manor. You need to be coming from a good place or your sister will be mad at you.
That's what my ex would do. Just bug her about it. I don't know if it works like that for siblings but my ex gained 10 pounds when I kept bugging her to eat a little more.
I would suggest bringing this up with your parents. This is not something that you should be dealing with at your age, and is their responsibilities. There is a fine line between anorexia and those awkward teenage years of trying to be as thin as possible, so she could well be developing anorexia.
At her age, body image is everything. So she feels pressured to be extremely thin like models and singers. Teach her not to copy them
Talk to her. Discuss her meal plans, and why she hasn't been hungry. If she is resistant to talking, tell your parents. Your parents can make the decision. They know what to do. If she needs to see a doctor, your parents will know.
I would try to talk to her before you tell your parents, but it's better to have her mad at you for a while for telling your parents than have her seriously hurt herself.
I used to be underweight, and honestly I had more energy back then. I became ill and hardly ate. I get enough sleep, nutrients. I do a lot of exercise. I am a 14 year old girl, do you think this is enough? I cycle 10 miles a day usually. Sometimes I take off 1-3 rest days in a week. I eat a whole foods diet. I drink enough water as well. I just don't get it. I feel hungry all the time too. Is it making up for the short period of starvation I went through? I hardly ate a single thing for almost 3 weeks, and I fainted a few times. I don't understand! I want energy!
It depends what you're eating. Maybe your body is just adjusting to the diet.
My friend said that he has suicidal thoughts. I don't know if he is really at a lot of risk though. He seems fine and happy, and has shown very little if any signs of suicide. I had no idea until He told me that he has suicidal thoughts. I don't know if it's just he has suicidal thoughts, but doesn't actually want to commit suicide at all, or if he does want to and has just been hiding it. How do I know which one it is, and what do I do about it? I'm really scared.
Listening to him can go a long way in helping. Remind him that he is a valued friend of yours and that you would like to help him in any way. Offer to take him out for coffee and just listen. People who suffer from depression are really good at hiding it. They want to appear confident to their friends and family, otherwise they feel like they might disappoint. (Which they absolutely would not!) Encourage him to seek professional help.
try to help him. just because you think he's happy doesn't mean he's actually happy. talk to him about it. ask him why he feels that way. ask what makes him feel that way. and try to be real comforting and there for him
Likely lower testosterone levels. Next time you go to the doctor, ask for a testosterone test-- just an additional blood test. Mine got low around that age and have been on supplemental testosterone since then. Makes a huge difference in how you feel, plus you want to have sex again more often.
because you are 51 years old.
old age
New account... First troll question
Also, it's only been since I started cutting. I've always had depression, so that's also something to go off. It's like I don't allow myself to feel sadness. I can get happy (to an extent), I can feel anger, so it's not like I am completely emotionless. And I have it under control. Since today, I had gone a week without relapse so I'm recovering. I do talk to people, but no one thinks that I still do it.
Firstly, if you're cutting there's probably something wrong... Secondly, depression can be sadness and feeling numb or emotionless, as I've heard, so I suspect this is what's happening to you. I think you should get help, but it's your choice. Good luck ^^
This feeling is not caused from cutting. It is caused by depression. It is common for people to feel numb and emotionless after being depressed for awhile. I recommend you talk to someone about this and get the help you need. It may seem like this isn't a big deal right now but cutting is actually really addicting. Eventually you will want to cut deeper and deeper and that will end very badly. Not to mention the fact that you will be stuck with scars for life.
Physical therapy is the answer! Exact thing happened to me. It did take a few weeks of treatment 3 times a week with my chiropractor because I am very athletic. Understand that the more you succumb to it and stay in bed, your body will constrict and never get healed. Try this stretch. Grab a towel and with two hands place under the ball of your foot and stretch back. Now switch feet. This is a start. Now get it taken care of for a better quality of life
You need to be referred to an Orthopaedic surgeon in the UK for MRI scans to see what is causing it. I was fobbed off for years until I insisted on a referral. In the meantime you could try an Osteopath, they are much gentler than a Chiropractor. Go back to the Doctors and tell them you want it investigated. They know little about back problems. UK
Try to get an MRI on your back to see if there is any structural damage. If MRI is clear and there is nothing hitting the nerve. It is a muscular problem Focus on all forms of planks especially the back ones. You may need to get your core (abs,sides and low back strong) as was my case when I had low back pain and sciatica in both legs. There is also a muscle in your hips that can cause that too if irritated.
Sometime a good chiropractor can give you some relief along with some exercises to do. Worth a try. It helped me once upon a time and I am not bothered with it anymore.
You are foolish to refuse physical therapy. There is no quick cure for this. If you want to feel better, follow the doctor's advice. It takes work, if you want to heal.
Painkillers and heat pads helped me.
Well have you considered that the "wet" aspect could be ejaculate?
It's normal to be wet (with precvm) before ejaculation. And normal after ejaculation. Some guys leak precvm very easily, all the time. So their glans is often wet or at least moist. Especially common with uncut guys.
Yes it's normal for the penis head to be wet after ejaculation. My penis is wet after I've ejaculated.
Are you uncircumcised or not? I've seen uncut penis glans wet sometimes while masturbating and cut too but both probably from precum. I don't know about after ejaculating though. Probably just a drop or two of cxm that came out after you hit your orgasm. Happens a lot when you don't push it out.
Well the semen and post-- pre-ejaculatory fluid come out after ejaculation for up to an hour so liquids are present.
vaginal discharge may have a slight odor, but it should be musky. it should be fine if it itches a little but it's not normal if it's super itchy, that could be a yeast infection (nothing that serious, just go to the doctors and she'll give you medicine which will help). clear discharge is totally normal and can happen anytime because it's your vagina self cleaning. if it's stretchy and white, you're probably ovulating and should stay away from unprotected sex during this time.
Yes, sounds like a yeast infection coming on, best to shower after water activities and wash daily. Use a new panty shield daily. This has been happening t me since I was 12, I'm 53 now and still use daily shield, you'll find the discharge will ruin your underwear and rip the padding off your undies.
its normal. NEVER wear pantyliners. you should start eating the discharge. it tastes AMAZING. try it
No such thing. The only thing with cats and women is that pregnant women should not empty cat litter boxes due to the ammonia smell and possible contact with the feces.
Yes and no. Cats are a common carrier of a bacteria called Toxoplasmosis Gondii. Infection occurs, most often, by accidentally consuming it in the cat's feces. T. Gondii is known to be harmful to a devoloping fetus, especial when the primary infection occurs during pregnancy. T. Gondii, however, is believed to have latent infection which has the potential to cause fetal harm. The current recomendation is for pregnant women to avoid cat feces [ie make hubby change the litter box], in addition to prenatal screening.
I don't see the correlation between the two
I'm depressed. I told my parents and they said that it was just because of being a teenager or that I was on my period or something like that. But I cut myself, I have tried to overdose, and I think about committing suicide several times everyday. I cry myself to sleep and I just feel like I can't deal with life anymore. Can someone please help me?
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Talking to someone always helps. It may seem daunting to open up to someone, but it helps, trust me. Talk to someone other than your parents though. Maybe a teacher that you like and trust, or even the nurse at your school. Its their job to not only help with your physical well being, but also your mental health
You could start with your school counselor. Show them what you wrote and ask them for assistance. See if they can contact Social Services and tell your story to a social worker. They can interview you at school and will likely want to interview your parents also. This link provides several counseling options to choose from - http://bfy.tw/2dzq
Get a dream, get a real big dream. Not an impossible one, but one such as change the world. It's easier then you think. You could invent something great, you could be the best president. It's your life
Yes, a counsellor can help you.
The sun does not set. The earth spins. Maybe God does it, maybe gravitational forces in the universe cause planets to revolve.
Seth- Sun Set . Da dude set the sun down and brings darkness . Amin-re is real and resurrected daily . One resurrection puzzy .
it sets due to the rotation of the planets
The planet earth rotates.
God is an idiot. He made humans suck another animal called Mexico LIKE WTF **** GOD He's gay!
It's normal, it's the natural position for it to enter a females vagina.
"That's your 'Friend Compass, and it's pointing up because Jesus is your friend." That's what it's supposed to do.
And what? Normal. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
"Looking up" is the natural position for entering your sexual partner. Her body is made for that (internally), so it's actually an advantage.
This is normal
lol penia
No, that is not necessary. Use clitoral stimulation before you ever penetrate that gets the girl closer to orgasm anyway.
you most likely need to use foreplay and your mouth to give any woman an orgasm - very few women have orgasms from intercourse alone
some women are incapable of orgasm
Nope. It's all about how you rub the inner walls of her vagina.
You need to never use your penis for anything except making pee pee otherwise your genes will be passed on.
Other way around, Champ.
No, it is the friction of your penis that should do it.
I am a 15 year old girl, and I've been on my first period for 3 and a half weeks. Now, it's not painful at all and it never has been and it's always medium to light, rarely heavy flow. I need something to balance out my hormones because I've already gone through many pads and it's really bothersome to be bleeding for this long. My problem is that I am so so so very terrified of the gyno and I just cannot go. Will they prescribe something to fix my extra long period without a pelvic exam? If I have to I'd rather wait for my period to even itself out. Also, I am a virgin.
It depends on the gynecologist. Technically, no, it is not required... but since it is part of good health for a sexually active woman many doctors do insist on pairing the two. You'd just have to call and ask. Most Planned Parenthoods can do a birth control prescription without a pelvic exam. Also just FYI, going on hormonal birth control is a bit excessive for a single wonky first period in a teenaged girl.
They have to figure out why you are having that problem. They don't always do a pelvic for bleeding. They sometimes order an ultrasound and some blood tests first. If you make the appointment for when you are on your period, they really won't want to do a pelvic, because they won't be able to see anything because of the blood.
well i am a happily married man and i just went with my wife to one of those yesterday and her doctor did a pap smear while i was there and it was like over in 20 seconds and what you should do is have someone go with you for support
You don't have a disorder most likely you're just alittle self conscious and perhaps insecure. It is normal to feel this way. Sometimes for example I think about how I am walking and then suddenly forget how to walk lol. Don't try to be anything you aren't. I wouldn't worry about being more charismatic because you probably are naturally when you aren't trying to be. Just try not to overthink things because if you try to define yourself a certain way or label yourself a certain adjective it won't be genuine. Be yourself. Some people find awkwardness charming anyway. No worries
I had girly low pitch voice n I thought changing my voice makes me confident like others I see Now I changed voice but still I'm not confident I learnt so far is u should have enough knowledge n proud of wtever u r(don't take too much) I'm trying. Also try to speak with More ppl. Once u get used to talking u be good enough to talk bold I'm trying but I lack emotions lol.I got mostly 1 expression on face.
awkward is cute
Don't be embarrassed. You could continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties.
Your'e only 4inches tall? That's extraordinary!
Your penis size of 4 inches is slightly smaller than the average for your age, but still a good size. It will probably grow some more because of your age too.
Most likely not. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Might do. Maybe use it more. < M
is your father small
Lung cancers are slow-growing and quite rare in teens. This sounds more like a respiratory tract infection. See your doctor to get evaluated and treated.
A respiratory tract infection is far more likely. See a dr. You may need a course of intibiotics.
Had a similar thing happen to me as a child,i coughed up blood a lot.I had a severe lung infection,best get that checked out...just to be sure.
It's possible but not likely.
it's not possible and if it bothers you see a doctor
Highly doubtful. But you should have a chest x-ray. see your doctor.
Nose bleeds are common.
No, its an average size, most guys fall to this size, 80% of men and 20% is either smaller or bigger penis.
Nope. That's a very good size. Almost a full inch over average.
Yes
No, about an inch above adult average.
No. It's not small. Is it large? No.
Considered average - it is small. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Nope...unless she's a size queen
average for caucasians
nope
My best and only friend of ten years was recently diagnosed. I was shocked but now I feel...I don't want to say indifferent, but that just about describes it. I love her and can't imagine her not being here, what is wrong with me? Sorry if this all sounds selfish but I don't know how to react. I just can't really believe it.
You're probably in shock. Dealing with bad news like that is hard and everyone deals with it differently. Don't feel bad. It's normal
Your best friend has been diagnosed with cancer and your only questio, asked in a cancer forum, is what is wrong with you!?! Sounds like you are pretty self centred. As for being sad, depending on your friends prognosis, sadness is not always an appropriate emotion anyway. Shock, fear, concern, curiosity, are all valid. If you are as self centered as your question indicates then indifference would be appropriate .
You're in shock it's normal. Don't push yourself things will happen naturally in the way you can handle them.
Nothing. You are simply in a state of shock, and it's hard to put that into feelings.
It just hasn't become a stark reality for you yet. When you see how she suffers over time, you'll come out of the Twilight Zone.
There is no one way to react. And honestly, your friend is not dead yet. So don't rush to mourn her and miss her. She is sick. Help her out in ways you would with any sick friend. You will have plenty of time to mourn her if she dies.
Definitely not. You want to avoid white potatoes if you want weight loss. You can have up to two sweet potatoes a week, but avoid the white.
I can't lose weight with potatoes unless no fat and one fourth cup only, no seconds.
Only if they're in the form of french fries.
no they have carbs
20 is a great start, but you should steadily increase the number. Do as many as you can without building up soreness that lasts more than a few hours. Do pushups 5 days a week, and pick two days to rest. (Maybe Sunday and Wednesday). At 15, you can probably increase the number of pushups by 1 every workout session. Though if you notice excessive soreness, maybe 1 pushup every other workout session.
Depends what for. You need a lot more than 20 if you're aiming high
What's the matter with you? Get your studies done first!
it's not good, but it's a better start than most.
20 is pretty low, if you been doing it for few months.
The relationship between a brother and sister should not be a sexual relationship. Both should feel safe in the family relationship. The love between a brother and sister should not be a romantic relationship. The human race survived partly due to genetic variances from marrying and having children between genetically diverse genes. That reduces the amplification of bad and faulty genes. A romantic relationship generally leads to a sexual relationship in the short, medium or long term. A sexual and romantic relationship will often lead to creating a baby.
The problem with sibling birth is that IF they have a defective gene in their DNA, & most people have one or two, both of then have the same DNA & they are much more likely to have a problem child.
And still, you just keep asking this one.
Please see http://www.circinfo.com/post-op_care/car... for very useful advice on the post-op care of your new circumcision, including how to reduce nocturnal erections, and improve sleep. The penis always looks worse for the first week or so and many think that they shouldn't have got circumcised - however once all is healed you will be very pleased with your circumcision.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked amazingly. Kept getting me hard for almost 4 days and I felt huge! Could last longer the first time, then was hard and ready again in minutes. The second time lasted forever. Well worth it to me!
Take painkillers. Maybe try taking Aspirin, and Ibuprofen (at the same time) rather than tylenol which is not very good.
have you been back for your follow up visit
A scar is a scar. You will have it always. After it heals well, you can use a product like vitamin E or Bio Oil to help fade it. P.S. don't get a tan on that area, it will cause the scar to darken.
Use an ice cube it will help get rid of the scar don't worry I have so many there's one close to my eye but it healed quickly..
Put a blob of moisturiser on it and after about 20 minutes take it off, the scar should come off with it. If it doesn't, just try again
They have ointments for scars at the pharmacy. You can try to put cover up makeup on it to hide it.
Apply lemon to the scar. ... Use honey. ... Try onion extract. ... Consider using aloe vera gel. Aloe Vera's anti-inflammatory properties help reduce skin irritations and help remove dead skin from wounds. ... Use Indian gooseberry. ... Make or purchase cucumber paste. ... Try tea tree oil.
give it time to heal on it's own

Let the hate flow through you.
Nope, sounds right to me.
no, you are mature and sensible.
No.
Why would you ask that? That's completely up to you. And your parents have no say in whether you shave or not. They can't prevent you from shaving. That's just silly.
Seeing as you can't spell correctly I'd advise you not touch anything sharp.
Why do they not allow you to shave? Do they actually believe the myth that if you shave it will grow faster or thicker? Just cutting dead tissue -- any visible hair is dead.
if you don't like your mustache then shave it.
You keep active which you seem to be doing and heighten your metabolism with caffeine (coffee recommended) chocolate and tea works also and eat lighter meals.
For a woman you are very tall and you are also athletic, your weight is fine. Too much lost weight will harm you
don't need to lose any weight at all.
girl or boy? that doesn't sound fat. maybe above average but not really fat. it's hard to say without pictures or anything though.
If you don't work out or play sports, ya you probably are.
yes,you are fat
lol yea bro
Lie on your back, lift your legs up over your head, and take it in your mouth. You have to be very flexible in order to accomplish this though.
You need to be very flexible AND have a long penis. It's a rare combination.
Lmao get a girl to do it for you it's less difficult
start with a long di ck
you must have a special body
You should stay away from Yahoo Questions. Yours is an abusive post and does not belong here.

why you telling us? call the hotline.

I do have a valid prescription, but my last job made such a big deal about the whole thing and made me see their doctor and have my doctors say I was OK to work. It was so intrusive for someone who has had a chronic condition and seen pain management for several years with no issues. I was hoping to avoid the whole thing if it wasn't going to show up in the first place. I have read that oxycodone has to be tested specifically and is different than just testing for codeine or other opiods.
They should test for it purposefully. However many of those drug tests will verify what drugs you are taking legally before sending it in so they aren't inadvertently sending your employer your list of legal medical treatments. If that was the case they would have interviewed you for a list of prescriptions first. If your employer is ethical, they won't be interested in what prescriptions you are taking unless you operate machinery. In which case disclosure of your medication should be in your employment contract.
Yes, they can test for those, But if you have a valid Rx for them, you can use that to explain why it would be showing up, so you should be fine.
Probably, but they'd be easy to spot
My parents were lucky. They lived in a rural area where it's perfectly ok to not fix your dog. So they have puppies to raise and to remember their dogs that passed away but still it's hard to lose them but the puppies help. As for living in the city with my doggy I too worry one day she'll be no more. It's only natural that I outlive her, I am going to have to buy a puppy of the same breed after she is gone. I know it won't be the exact same but I can't come home to an empty home.
Get another dog. Or if you have the money you can clone him :D I'm not joking, you really can. The dog will look the same and have the same temperament. If all else fails, get a bearded dragon, they live for 12 years or a tortoise which lives for 120 years or a rabbit. They are all splendid cuddle buddies <3
Adopt another dog from a shelter. He needs you and you need him/her.
Buy another dog and get attached to him or her
see a counselor, therapist.
I read where law suits are piling up at Johnson & Johnson due to the recent discovery that talcum powder can cause cervical cancer. Their baby powder is made with talcum powder. Don't be scared just find out whats going on.
There is no such thing as a cancer jab you are being vaccinated for a virus that has the potential to cause cancer but it does not simply prevent cancer. It is nothing get over it.
A needle is a lot better than cancer. Counting just one cancer , I got about 20 needles, 2 surgeries radiation and chemo. Wish there had been a vaccination for that.
I would not subject my kids to something that does NOT prevent cervical cancer

Ugly women
Drinking, food poisoning of some sort, norovirus
It can be over-eating, and motion sickness (seasickness)
knowing your life sucks and your either gonna kill yourself or be homeless
Too much beer.
2 kids, both of you work. How can you find time for 4 to 5 times a day along with household chores and making dinner? Married 24 years here and my husband may have wanted it but was man enough to understand the family doesn't revolve around his pecker. Tell him his has 2 hands or help with the family ... get a hobby.
There are people with high sex drive... Try not to eat and you'll might understand.
Get him a sex toy.
If you don't know how to talk to your husband, why did you marry him?
He apparently was a punk. Now he is dead.
Gee, get a new line. That is old turkey and he wouldn't have liked you either. At least, learn English if you are going to live in this country.
I hate you and Zimmerman is a punk.
ok????? and your question is????? Obviously you can't spell and your statement is idiotic... I'm assuming you are all of 12 years old. Go play someplace else... This site is for adults.
Go a day without eating food and your stomach will decrease in size making you not so hingry the day after. The day after just eat veggies and fruits and then stick to that and eventually you're not going to crave fat foods and all you're going to want is healthy stuff. But don't do this for one day and then the next go to McDonald's and get a Mcpick 2 for $5 and come back on here and ask the same damn question.
Well are you ugly or just fat? Ima be honest with you, ugly can't be fixed. Fat can be and if you want to lose weight it's easy as ****. 1. Reduce your calorie intake. Based on your weight and height and how many calories you burn in a day. You need to burn more calories than you consume because the food you eat gives your body energy. If you eat less and burn more calories, your body has to use the fat and other resources already stored to get energy. 2. Workout to burn them calories 3. Do whatever the **** you wanna do
well- with your kind permission- I'm not sure enough whether you're really fat enough to need to lose weight or not....to begin with... until proven otherwise- you might need the professional advise of a nutritionist in real life-in your area- someone skilled in treating people of your age... very much depends on your age, height, real and ideal weight, caloric expenditure( for instance-your practice of outdoors sports), growth needs -if so... beyond this- beauty and ugliness - are in the eyes of the beholder... and nevertheless - everyone of us is a unique and unrepeatable pearl of mankind... so making your life miserable about whether you're ugly -if so- sounds to me a lousily inhuman idea ...
what you need to do is distract yourself I have the problem if im at home all day i tend to eat and eat when im not home I dont eat and this hole month i started working and i lost 10 pounds just cuz i wasnt at home i was distracted at work. another thing is that you need to try not to drink so much soda or juice water is best or you can drink both i always server my self a cup of water and when im done eating i drink the soda or juice so when im done eating i wont want to drink so much
are u ugly or fat ? either way u dont truely want 2 stop eating. perhaps try a diet. ps (dont be so critical)
Just eat vegetables.
Technically you posted this question in the wrong category. Spiritually you posted it the right category though, cause yes you are mentally sick. I find that very funny! Hahaha! Now get some goddamn help!
recently i have found that putting PVA glue on my penis, then waiting for it to dry and peeling it off, has been turning me on. I just find the pain so pleasant, it is hard to describe. It just works at getting me to ***. I want to tell my friends about it as it is becoming a frequent pastime for me. Should i? Or would that freak them out to much?
Probably don't want to share this with anyone except the kind of buddy you can share such intimate details with. Otherwise, not a good idea. Be careful. The skin there is thin and delicate. You could get a tear or cut. I've heard others like to do this with hot wax. I can understand why this might be a turn on as the skin is sensitive and has a lot of nerve endings there.
It's perfectly normal. Frequently I am at parties where adults discuss in detail the different adhesives and epoxies they enjoy putting on their penis and taking off again. You could even form a PVA club.
No. The military is the complete opposite of socialism. Officers give orders and lower ranks obey or be punished. The "workers" don't run the military. It doesn't generate money, anyway. So it in no way fits any sort of definition as a socialist institution. If the US was a socialist country, then you could say that the military was socialist to the extent that it fought to defend the revolution, but of course that is not the case here.
Listen up you stupid self righteous uneducated tw@t, you idiots mocked Republicans for the past 15 years when they were calling you guys socialists. Not only did you guys outright deny it over and over, but even tried to be condescending for that very question being asked in the first place. Suddenly an admitted socialist runs for president and you guys are, in an instant, all about socialism. So dude, go fck yourself with a cactus because I assure you, you are extremely stupid and your life's achievement will be to get the stubborn stains off the floor at McDonalds when your 60. Fck you and whatever parents failed to raise you with an ounce of brains.
And the tax funded health care systems that wealthy GOP candidates take in, while they vote against it for working class Americans. R stands for rich. They're for the rich.
GOP cons don't hate socialism provided it is restricted to the bottom 99%. They just want to eliminate any financial liability for themselves.
Lots of cognitive dissonance, that's for sure. Ones who are honest with themselves realize conservatism is intellectually dishonest. How do you think I ceased to be a conservative?
We LIKE that part. We just despise the part that pays Your Internet bill.
Learn what socialism is, idiot. It isn't the spending of tax revenue.
So you're admitting you want even more government control
Feudalism, not socialism
It gives them a reason to always be angry.

you look normal and be happy with your body
Some people come from families and a generation that, even when we were children, made us feel like burdens. Speaking for myself, I don't want to raise a family that way. Bringing children into the world is a responsibility and should be given time and serious thought as to how you want to do it or what you would do if you had an 'oopsie' baby. My parents didn't plan to have kids and weren't prepared and I want my family to have a better start and a more loving home than we did. It takes time and planing.
I'm a woman. I choose not to have children. I choose not to have children because I think it's selfish to want to bring a child into this crazy, screwed up world with all of it's mixed up priorities. Mix in the fact that genetics in my family are really bad, and each generation turns out worse than the previous one, and I feel like having kids, would be unfair to the children. For a lot of people I think it comes down to them not wanting to lose their freedom, they cannot get pregnant for various reasons, or they simply cannot afford to raise children
my theory is that as the population grows too large to sustain itself then there is a mechanism that switches off the reproduction genes. So that's why you see more women want to hook up for sex rather than settle with a boyfriend or men want to be women or marry other men,mgtows abandoning dating and marriage the environmental stressors relating to overpopulation like pollution are causing the sexual reproduction genes to "switch off" somehow. They've done experiments where they show that when mice get too overpopulated the male mice lose interest in breeding, I think you can see some parallels like with the Asian "grasseaters" etc.
It's not about not choosing. It's about having the means to support a family, let alone yourself these days. I would like to have kids, but that just isn't an option right now, and it may never be.
It seems though that the more successful a woman is the less chances of her wanting a child,so sometimes it is not a financial issue but a matter of just not wanting a child, you think ? To them success is their baby.
It's not just women its young couples who don't see kids in their future. I see nothing wrong with this. Why do you?
Birth control has a way of killing baby.
because they are to sellfish and to proud of their career, a child would only disturb that.
horrible generation
It does nothing to ruin your sex drive. In fact you are more turned on if you masturbate often
Depends on what you call excessive. Most guys do it at least once a day. All normal.
Yeah porn can ruin ruir imagination and get bored of everything.
yep
Hi, i recently received an emergency ct scan on my brain, after the doctor at emerg said there was something wrong when she looked into my eyes. (Plus having a variety of other symptoms and pain). My ct was done in 2 minutes and they did not use contrast. The results came back within the hour and the doc said it was normal; but somehow I'm scheduled for an MRI this week because they want me to get one. I'm wondering if it's possible for me to have a brain Tumor, even if my ct scan was negative? They said it was clear, but my symptoms are persistent
I seriously doubt you have a brain tumor. Your doctor should have said what he suspected so you don't go crazy. A CT scan shouldn't be done in 2 minutes. I had one of the chest, which is less complex, and it was 15 minutes. CT scans are better with bony structures. MRIs are better for soft tissues. CT scans don't give the detail, but they are faster. So moving to an MRI makes sense.
My tumours showed up on an x ray.
It depends on how tall she is. If she is at least 4'9" tall she is probably not overweight. It is best to talk to your pediatrician if you are worried about her weight or health.
this really depends. If she is 4 feet tall, that might be slightly overweight. If she is 5 feet tall, she's probably fine. It would help to know how tall she is to tell if she is overweight
depends on how tall she is. 4'0 yes, 5'0, no
It depends on her height.
Masturbation doesn't cause memory loss. If you're having a hard time focusing on your work due to pent up sexual frustration, go take care of business so you can concentrate.
Geez, don't believe everything you hear dude. Masturbation is just simple solo sex, a normal bodily function. Does not cause memory loss in any way. No logical reason it would.
LMAO... stop getting your information from other dumbass middle schoolers who don't know what they're talking about. Masturbation does not cause memory loss smart one. And no... you dont "need" to masturbate. You want to, big difference. there is no physical requirement to do so.
Masturbation does to cause memory loss nor retard penile development. However, the effort you put into it can cause short term drowsiness, therefore it is best to do your masturbation at night rather than in the morning before an exam.
no it does not cause any kind of memory loss. I'm doing it right now in fact and I....................what were we discussing?
90 pound is a bit underweight if you are 5'1", and 125 pounds is probably a bit too heavy at that height. But if the person is eating a healthy diet and staying active, then both are good.
You are a tad bit underweight. A female who is 5'1'' should weigh between 100-115 lbs
Depends on your frame . If you are anything like me, well I can't go over 98 and I'm 5'3.5. I feel sluggish over 98 plus look odd;stomach on a skinny body. If you are naturally skinny like me I don't recommend it .
125 is definitely more of a healthy weight.
not really i'm 95 and i'm 5'4
There really isn't much therapy anymore. Doctors think that their drugs are good for that. The drugs are mostly useless and dangerous - but doctors love them anyway because it gives them the sense that they're DOING something. And when they got drugs, they stopped turning out as many therapists. So sadly you'll find it hard to get anybody to talk to who knows much of anything. But look around - you might get lucky. Anxiety has an underlying reason which, when you understand it, will make the anxiety slack off and leave you alone.
Do you actually have social anxiety? First, get yourself diagnosed. Make sure. Then, just ask your doctor for medicine. He can't force you into therapy.
Well maybe. They may prescribe a medication or refer you to a counselor.
I'm afraid of vaginas
Please tell me the name and address of your doctor. I will go and verify.
If i cut my eating down to 1/3 of what i eat now.. Which is about 1800-1950 cals (which will end up to 600cals) Run 2-3 miles and drink 2gallons of water a day for 3-4weeks.. Do you think i will be able to lose 20+lbs (also cause i will be dropping my cals i will be taken vitamins, and tryna squeeze as much protein as i can into my diet)
Seeing the natural ingredients and that it was caffeine free I got a bad figuring why not. I am not to much overweight and a big tea drinker so I could easily slip it in my normal routine. I was impressed over the increased bowel movements it gave me. I also enjoyed the taste promoting me to keep drinking it simply because I liked the Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . Then after a week I noticed weight starting to drop off. I guess all those masses clogging my intestines are finally out of my system. Feels good to be clean inside.
No. Your body will go into starvation mode and will stop burning calories. It's even possible that you could gain weight though it's more likely that it will stay around the same after an initial significant loss in the first week or so.
*Eat these foods only... beef, hamburger (no bun), pork, hot dogs (no bun), chicken, turkey, eggs, cheese, butter, nuts, green salad with a little dressing. Pick one day a week, the same day and eat other foods in moderation. When you get discouraged, ask your self "what do I hate worse, being fat or no carbs".
Something like Gatorade or Pedialyte, or any drink with sugar and electrolytes. I prefer to use Squirt and just add a little salt. This does not guarantee that you will stop throwing up immediately, but you are more likely to keep some of it down, and replenish the salt and glucose levels in your blood. Even if you do throw up, keep drinking. Some will stay down, and eventually it will stop. I don't recommend sugary drinks under most circumstances, but in this case it is a good idea.
Are you sure it's the flu, vomiting isn't that common. DON"T DRINK GATORADE, YOU WILL REGRET IT. Drink water or real ginger ale not fake ginger ale. ONLY DRINK SMALL SIPS AT A TIME
You should stick to the BRAT diet (Bread, Rice, Apples, Toast) and Gatorade sometimes helps with stomachaches because is packed full of electrolytes and keeps you hydrated (which is VERY important when you are sick because being dehydrated often gives you head and stomachaches)
Things that have worked for me in the past: goldfish crackers and Coca Cola consumed very slowly. Then if you can keep that down for a while, potato soup helps.
Absolutely
Most girls can do it. There is no physical reason why girls would not be able to. I can do it, no problem.
Yes its possible
I am doing it right now
Oh no, there is a small chance that the sperm will enter your face and will get your face pregnant. I suggest you feed your dog pills and let it lick your face again.
A person can only get pregnant if the sperm enters your uterus . people give blow jobs all the time.They don't end up getting pregnant , do they? So since it was just your face , you don't need to worry. but in case the dog licked you down south , you'd need to re-check.
The only way to get pregnant is for sperm to enter your vagina and travel into your uterus. The answer is no, you will not get pregnant. However, I would advise your sister and her boyfriend to properly dispose of used condoms, and to wash your face.
I would rate your trolling at about 2/10 Next time, try to include some dragons
There's no chance you'd get pregnant from that if it's on your mouth. Pretty gross though... Wash your face/mouth lol...
Yes, definitely.
Even if you had oral sex you couldn't get pregnant
This is awesome, lol.
Retard
um...seriously???
Please do not even begin to consider this, call 911 or reach out to someone because suicide will not help anything, only bring pain to the people around you. You say no one needs you but that is impossible, everyone needs each other and I am sure more people care about you then you think. Just look at the few paragraph answers of people that care about you without even having met you. Just believe me when I say it's not worth it, please do not do this.
I’m so glad that you are reaching out for support today. It sounds like you’re struggling at the moment and you deserve some help to get through this. If your suicidal thoughts are overwhelming, please call 911 or go to the nearest hospital for immediate treatment. It’s also important that you let somebody close to you know how you’re feeling. An adult relative, trusted friend, counselor, therapist, or doctor can work with you to come up with some strategies to get through these thoughts and feel better. Know that you’re not alone in these thoughts and there are people out there who want you to be safe and happy. Please continue to reach out. PF, Counselor
Listen to me you think this will fix anything no it wont. The only thing that coms with suicide is more suffering. You'll become the devil's ***** He will make you expirence more pain then you are now and you will wish you had satyed. What you are going through is normal in life everyone has experienced in life. Hell look at me i thought death was my only way out before and i tried to kill myself and i did they brought me back. And everything changed. Nothing is worth loseing your life over
Suicidal thoughts means you have depression. Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. Once your body adjusts to it (2-3 wks), you will feel like a new, happy, healthy person.
well, with your kind permission- I humbly guess you're young enough to be my son/ daughter- to begin with... it sounds to me- until proven otherwise- you're depressed and/ or traumatised deeply and severely enough to urgently! need the professional help of a psychiatrist-in real life-in your area- someone skilled in treating people of your age- with no further delay... inasmuch as you feel that bad GET NOW to the Emergency Room... I hereby beg you: refrain, repeatREFRAIN - from ANY form of even trying to self- harm or take your own life- whatsoever...
Tie a string around your tooth and tie it to a ceiling fan and then turn the fan on, that'll kill you pretty quickly
well you could shoot yourself in the roof of your mouth. but i guarantee you wouldnt be able to bring yourself to actually pull the trigger. you can do that (make sure you use a shotgun) all other ways are horrificly painful.
just don't do anything. Imagine you're dead already. Just sleep all day.
the least painful thing to do is not do it and get some help
When you're going insane does everything seem slower? Like it's in slow motion? ~~~ No.
No you don't even notice till one day you lose 100% attachment from reality and a dude with a clipboard says congrats you're nuts.
From that time when I started like this to think in a negative way i.e. (to act like an insane person), I have not been able to decide firmly about my future. It is a pity.

The age and severity of the mutilation varies by country. Female genital mutilation (which usually involves a clitorectomy) is a mostly muslim thing, although not all muslims do this and not all FGM victims are muslim. 98% of the women in Somalia have suffered FGM; that's over five million clits. And yes, this is awful to think about.
It's referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM) it is done with either a piece of broken glass or a sharp piece of scrap metal.
whats the question
Hi there. I am 16 and reaching the point where I have opportunities to have sex but with all the talk of big penises and all that, i m really self conscious that i ll get laughed at. My penis is roughly 4-5 inches wide and just over 5 inches long. I have already hit the peak of my growth spurt a few years back but never saw a huge growth in my penis. I have grown hair everywhere on my body except coarse hair on my chest and stomach and coarse facial hair.
All the talk about big penises is just that. Talk. The absolute average size for an adult erect penis is 5.1 inches. In other words, you have exactly the average and most common erect penis size. You have nothing to worry about.
A bit possibly but it is pretty much adult size now. I would grab those "opportunities" while they are there. Girls do not as a rule carry rulers. < M
Sorry , it is more than small and will not grow any further
tanning oil, creams, They are for sale commercially in many places
Plenty of sun
Tanning lotion, go to Walmart etc.
Baby oil and iodine.
Now you tell me.. I just spent a bundle on a professional exterminator to clean out all my asp holes and cockatrice dens.
You do know an asp is a snake that lives in burrows don't you?
That is the most absurd way that could be worded lol...but I believe it is true. There will come a time when God ushers in an era of peace that hasn't been seen since the Garden of Eden and at that time man/animal will co-exist in perfect harmony.

Wait.... what.... why.... what....?
Probably some kind of acne. Maybe milia. Try using a pimple extraction tool that is thoroughly sterilized. Then put some triple antibiotic on it.
Sounds like pimples it's normal And Joey shut up

Dr. Google is not your friend. It doesn't matter how much you are convinced ... you don't know ****. You claim to have been stressed for weeks? You don't believe your mom? Your mom knows you and your hypochondria quite well. There's nothing wrong with you other than the voices in your head. Stop listening to them.
The fact of the matter, if you think you have cancer, pray to God and read your bible and get some organic flax seed, it has been proven to eliminate breast cancer, you take 1 teaspoon a day everyday until the lymph node is gone and not hard anymore. Also Your milk that you drink, get organic milk and drink 100% natural spring water to hydrate your body. May God richly bless you and save you and watch over you. Try to only eat organic food or 100 % all natural food, because I think the food is what is giving you the problems.
I've got a lymphnode the size of a grape right next to my carotid artery on my throat, it's fine. That's your body's landfill. Even when you don't feel sick, your body is killing bacteria and burning their corpses. Sometimes, however, a lymphnode can atrophy from lack of use. In these situations, another lymphnode carries the burden while another grows back. In other words, grow up kid.
So get help for your very bad health anxiety. That's not normal, you spend your days worrying your life away. I'd say that's serious enough to get help for.
So go to a doctor and have it checked. It could be a cyst or other growth that has nothing to do with cancer. If you enjoy panicking over what could be nothing, that is your choice. We can't help you deal with ignorance.
Im 14. i have been bullied well still bullied and everyday i hate it i can't even talk to people. i have suicidal thoughts and don't talk to anybody anymore. i have thought about self harm but never gone through with it. i hate myself and life in general. Im bullied everyday and teachers don't care. I have not yet told my parents yet and i feel so isolated and alone i just want to curl up in a ball a die. I don't know what to do.
I'm 36 was bullied all my school years pl don't suffer in silence tell someone if not parents doctor maybe Iv had depression all my life from school years the bullying probably caused it you can be strong the bullies are weak try to fight back go to the main bully one to one if you think you can handle them . I did it a primary school they chicken on they own . Tell your parents please sisters brothers anyone that loves you
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Ask a dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
If the pain is temporary, just take it easy. if it last for a long time and always recur, you could go to see the doctor. It may be caused by inflammation or infection. Because in Chinese theory, bladder pain is caused by the congestion of blood and qi, take some natural herbs could eliminate the inflammation and relieve pain, such as Diuretic and Anti-inflammatory pill.
Ok. Every male that has testicles has pain shoot through various parts of his body when his testicles are squeezed. That's normal smart one.
Usually the pain means: "Dude. Stop doing thaaaat. HEY! BAD!."
That is normal. You aren't supposed to squeeze your balls man. Not healthy
Yeah, that is your body saying "don't squeeze your balls".
Oh good, so the nerves work o.k. then. < M
they think that if im left alone i will cut even tho i promised i wouldnt but its so dammm hard to not cut i feel invaded that i cant cut because they check my body they dont let me go out with friends. i cant have my bedroom door closed , im very limited to things. its frusterating they get annoying and cry i told them not to worry i aint **** when people cry i dont feel bad i think its annoying i find my slef as cold hearted i just dont have a lot of emotions ive been depressed
Cut your parents
My parents found out I was adopted
It will take them a long time to fully trust you again. You need to be patient.
THIS ISN'T A QUESTION
And the question is?
Your body is going through a change. Your lungs are likely getting rid of all the build up in your lungs accumulated by the smoking. Hang in there!
Probably withdrawal symptoms. Body's way of finally detoxing and cleansing the rest of it
It may be slight withdrawal, I would keep with the clean life. Eat a lot of fruit and vegetables or vitamins to keep your immune system up
It's just withdrawal symptoms
Well, what are you waiting for? Spark up, Bud!
See a doctor, counselor, therapist.
you seem like you might have a disorder not saying it's a bad thing but you might want to go see a doctor
Tell your dr. about all this. There are good meds for paranoia, fear and anxiety.
ya i have it too. Tis called anxiety and depression
I m 18 and I know I have BPD, I have not been diagnosed but it all makes sense and I have only recently realised it. Everything links to BPD from my past to my uncontrollable anger and emotional distress, to always fighting with my girlfriend, to drug use and being terrified of being alone. I'm at the edge now, and I just don't understand why I should stick around even though everyone tells me I need to. I feel like a psycho and I feel like I'm never going to get better.
Trust me you will get better. I used to have severe ocd, I still have it but not as bad. I thought the same thing what the point of living If I keep having these irrelevant thoughts. It gets better. I know right now it feels like the end of the world but it's not you will get better. My old was so bad that I had to touch everything in my backyard and if someone talked to me I would breakdown in tears and panick . Please don't think about what's the point of living. I know it's hard but you can get through this I hope you have an amazing day God bless you :)
I have a terminal disease. It is called "life". One day I am going to die. Tough. You have problems. Either stop blaming the problems for the mess you are making or just kill yourself now. It isn't BPD that has anything to do with the choices you make. Anger can be indulged or tamped down. Drugs make it a lot worse so what sort of idiot would even think of taking them when they already had problems. Instead of letting your girl help you, you fight with her. The simplistic solution is to stop wallowing in self pity and start living. Maybe it takes effort. But the results are definitely worth it.
BPD is more and more common these days but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel. There are good meds for BPD.---------- Ask a dr. if you could take Zoloft. It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it but, after that, you will be a whole, new, calm, happy person.
There are these people out there... called therapists... they help stuff like this.
Don't do it...
testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
There is no point.
No. That is not considered a sport. Lifting weights could be a sport if you do something like powerlifting. Sports have a form of competition. There needs to be a way to compete for it to be a sport so doing construction or exercising and things like that would not be a sport.
Lifting weights is a sport.
weight lifting is a sport, working out is not a sport, though.
Lifting weights is definately a sport, it is definately my favorite because of the countless benefits.
No.
3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food
3 weeks
they call it the rule of 3 you'll die if you go: 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food
A month. A few days without water
I was told 3 days
A lot long than without water or sleep. Those you'll die without pretty fast.
If you are well feed and rested, usually up to like 40 days.
I would talk to his oncologist and see what he has to say. But, then again, most doctors will tell you to give up smoking anyway and to cut back on drinking. If he's got CLL, a form of blood leukemia, I smoked for the first five years I had it and still have an occasional few drinks. I'm still here. I was diagnosed with CLL about 6 years ago and am still in watch and wait phase. Good luck to him.
What about the monosodium glutamate, the BPA in the linings of canned foods, etc. ? They sell Fabreze, spray it on this and that. Have those chemicals been tested for safety? No. Of the some 80,000 different chemicals that we can come in contact with, only about 200 have been tested for safety. And then we wonder why the cancer rate is growing like Gangbusters. Glyphosphate, aka 'Roundup' weed killer is a carcinogen, but it's not publicized
The dude has cancer... if he wants to smoke and drink, just let him. There are clearly worse things in life. You know... like cancer.
depending on how far along the cancer is it might not matter what they do. you need to ask his doctor this.
It's his decision, dear.
Expired means that the potency could be lower than when it was fresh; however, many over the counter pills are fine for a long while after expiration. Look it up.
2013 is years and years ago! I'd say no and to buy new, fresh drugs. Those expired drugs probably won't work.
It depends on the drug. In general they become less effective with age, but not more dangerous.
your safe and it might not even work
12:01 is pm at noon and in the middle of the night 12 is am. Why it is best to use military time and 1pm is 13: and like that makes more sense than am pm thing.
If we did it correctly it would be 12M for noon because AM is ante-meridian (before the meridian) and PM is post-meridian (after the meridian) but you can imagine how much confusion that would cause from people that wanted 12N for noon and 12M for midnight. 12:00 PM is the one in daylight along with 12:01, 12:02, and so on
It is 12 PM....12 AM is 12 in the morning, meaning Midnight.
noon is 12pm midnight is 12am
By convention, 12 AM denotes midnight and 12 PM denotes noon. Thanks for the 2 points for doing the quick internet search for you.
noon is pm
It's neither. "AM" stands for "ante meridian." That is, before the meridian. "PM" stands for "post meridian." That is, after the meridian. Noon (as well as midnight) occur precisely at the meridian. It's neither before nor after. "AM" ends the instant before noon. "PM" begins the instant after noon.
noon is pm, midnight is am this is why so many people say noon and midnight
in between
12PM. 12:00PM
Give it a couple of days to see if you adapt, and if you don't, put your old glasses back on and head to the eye doc for a re-evaluation. That's a pretty big jump in power, and I would expect some time to adapt. My husband has had a couple of new pairs of glasses where they've had to cut the prescription change for him to be able to tolerate it.
Next morning after you wake up, wear your new glasses. Do you still get a headache? If you still get a headache, go back to your optometrist. As said, wear your old glasses. Bring along your new glasses.
i would give your eyes more time to get used to them
Don't know. But they do know why you stay in the shower a long time- parents know exactly when their kids are masturbating. Your dad did the same thing himself.
Yes if you're Moaning like a cave man
Yes
Music is distracting. You wont reach the greatest pleasure.
Likely they will not hear you either way unless you moan or scream during masturbation.
They can't as long as you aren't moaning loudly.
12 is not old enough so just wait until you are 18
It's strange how the average 12 year old boy has a penis that is 2 to 3 inches erect. Even more strange that a 12 year old boy would claim to have an adult size penis...? I'm smelling a troll.
Stop trolling. 12 year olds aren't even permitted to be on this site. Grow up and keep your penis info to yourself - no one cares about it. At 12, you wouldn't even know enough about sex to engage in it (having to ask a question like this would prove that).
You're 12.
Make sure you have a good 4-6 hours of time after smoking before he picks you up. Smoke in a different shirt and then change when you go home. Or wear a jacket while smoking and take it off after. Spray yourself with some perfume and you'll be good. The smell of weed doesn't stick around long!! Especially to fabrics. Most importantly, enjoy your time and be safey friend :)
You can't hide the smell unless you use baby wipes or some other wipes all over your exposed skin and hair, and have a clean shirt to put on.
he probably already has. Face it he's not stupid. Also be assured that Pot doesn't make you any smarter healthier or wiser. Just intoxicated.
I doubt he will be mad if he does it. Just change your shirt or spray some cologne. Don't over do it or it'll be obvious.
best way is break the habit
Go to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. They will bring in a mental health professional to work with you about what the next best steps are.
Please tell your parents all of that ! They need to know and they will help you. They will be there for you. Don't worry there is a happier place other than were you are right now ! Guarantee you will feel better once you get help. In the meantime don't do any thing stupid please. Even if you don't think about it there is people out there that care more than you know.
being in a psych ward for a day is better than dying forever. get help. go to the hospital or see a doctor. seriously. it gets better.
i think you need to go away and learn the English language, then return once you can type grammatical English.

Nom same reason you wait a 1/2 hours to swim after eating. Body will cramp up, you're hurting your digestive track and eat within a hour and half sounds a good pace.
Yes you should eat something that provide you enough energy to workout without causing any fatigue. for eg. You can eat a banana or two for this purpose you can try some egg whites for that. You can also try pre workout supplements before going to the gym.
Visit local libraries for books on how where when why what.
You probably just still have a UTI. There is almost no chance of pregnancy. No contraceptives are 100% effective, you can get pregnant even on birth control or after Plan B, but it is highly unlikely. Go to a doctor. Your UTI may be resistant to the particular antibiotic you were on, or you may have needed a longer course of antibiotics to be effective. (For me, I've never had anything less than a 10 day course of antibiotics for a UTI.)
If you took PLan B within 72 hours, there's no worry of pregnancy.
Unprotected intercourse create the issue related to unplanned pregnancy . Always use condom and safety kit to resolve the issue of unwanted pregnancy . Go online and read all details about this. USGenericShop.com
It sounds like your UTI is back. The antibiotics may not have worked, you may need a stronger one. The only other thing I can think of are kidney stones, but you would have pain. I wouldn't correlate the blood in your urine with pregnancy. I hope Plan B works better for you than it did for me tho! :-/
I dint think it's pregnancy
Get to a doctor ASAP! I had the same thing happen to me, I ended up getting a bladder infection and it was aweful! If it moves to your kidneys then you might have to be hospitalized and it takes a much longer time for your body to heal
That is discharge and is completely normal, all women get it. It's a sign that your vagina is cleaning itself. It could be a sign that your period is coming soon, although I had it for 19 months before I got my period.
Yes. It's normal. I remember that I thought something was wrong with me when it happened. It's completely natural. Its just your lady parts cleaning themselves.
Part of puberty. It's normal for every girl at your age. It's a sign that your entering puberty, and might be getting period period soon. Don't worry.
Discharge is normal. You'll have it until you're about 50.
It's called vaginal discharge. Just buy some pantyliners and you'll be fine.
This is called "Discharge" and it is just your vagina cleaning itself out. Wear Pantyliners to stay dry and comfortable. Change often.
Your dentist will probably fill your cracked teeth.
Most likely fill it. they may also shave it and put a crown on it. it just depends on what he thinks is the best course of action.
He will fix the cracked tooth like he does a filling.
I think you'll find out soon.
?
Uh....if you gain on 1035 calories, your metabolism is completley screwed up. People normally eat 1800-2400 claories a day.
No, your body uses more than that just to be alive.
probably nothing - the avg body burns more than that every day just existing
go to the gym
Yes, this is typical. Give it a few days to a week. Note, it is not your eyes that are adjusting, it's your brain that has to adjust to the slightly different image that's being presented to it through the new lenses. You get to decide if your vision is better enough to justify wearing the glasses all the time. Wearing them part time will not affect your eyes.
Having the correct vision may make things seem odd at first, especially when being corrected for astigmatism. You could start fresh in the morning with them on right out of bed. You probably do not have to wear them all the time but as you said you have noticed a good change with them already (correction for astigmatism is the "fine tuning" for the eye), you may want to wear them all the time.

You laugh it off if at an open shower and turn on cold water to "shock" yourself down there to make it go flaccid.
ignore it finish your shower get out and get dressed
i dont put myself in that situation again
nothing, you keep it. it's a common stuff, nobody cares...
You need to search out your g-spot. It;'s usually right behind the clitoris inside on the upper wall of the vagina and feels like a raisin when its deflated. As you finger it, it swells and sends sensations to your nerves to get you to orgasm.
Try a penis.. they are specifically designed for the vagina.. however, if you're not sexually aroused, you're not going to feel anything, either.
Unless highly aroused you generally won't feel much via vaginal penetration - when highly aroused your vagina is more sensitive, thus stimulating the cervix or the g-spot (which is only responsive when highly aroused as this is the area involved in clitourethrovaginal complex anatomy) during vaginal sex can be pleasurable to some. If you don't feel anything via vaginal penetration you're under no obligation to have sex with vaginal penetration.
This is perfectly normal, you do not have any nerve endings in your vagina, that is why you do not feel anything. To have an orgasm you need to stimulate your clitoris
I used Prolargentsize herbal pills for a month, I will reorder. I did notice some thickening, and better perforrmance. I recommend this product, it Works
It's possible that blood is having more difficulty getting there, yes. The solution is, lose weight fatty.
Works very well!! No side effects , such as headaches other users complain about. Would recommend and have reordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product again.
It is possible. Also, if you get fat enough, your penis will shorten in length.
You do not have breast cancer in any way shape or form. At 13 years old you are more apt to have tea with the queen herself. Relax, this is nothing more than your still developing breasts. Not Breast Cancer...you don't check for anything, until you reach the age of 20. Then you start doing self breast exams.
What you are experiencing is normal adolescence. Breast development is commonly lopsided in adolescents. Breast self checks for cancer are NOT recommended for anyone under the age of 20 as they are to identify changes from normal in mature breast tissue. In teenagers, changes can take place on a daily basis. The risk of breast camcer at your age is statistically ZERO.
You have ZERO chance of breast cancer at 13, kid. There is no need for you to self check for cancer, no possible way you can have it. And it's completely normal for one to be bigger.
lumps are the key, breasts are not perfect pairs they are all individuals.
May grow a bit more in length or could be done, girth will grow for about a year. Length is about an inch above adult average.
Yes, your penis size is very good. The average penis size is 5 to 6 inches so your penis at 6 inches is on the big side.
yes and yes
Gently exfoliate using these products - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference
use cleansing milk lotion on your face and massage it for at least 5 to 10 min then wash it by cold water then take hot water steam after that apply egg white on the black head areas then keep the tissue paper on that area.when it dry then remove the tissue paper slowly.you will see your blackheads remove.
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
I dont know about clearing blakcheads and acne without buying stuff but I suggest you should watch you face every other hour to remove dirt on your face. It helps. Facemask/nosepacks are pretty cheap though and it's really helpful.
Yes
I hate pretending i have physical illness but i love pretending I have mental illness. I look up articles on mental health and know a lot about them. I pretend I have bipolar and i say i hear voices and see things but I dont. I am now on medication for seeing ghosts and hearing voices, and love it. I fake mental illnesses just so I can go to a mental hospital. I feel safe there. I love it. I fake suicide attempts and self harm just so I can go to hospital. Is it a good thing that I do this?
That in its self is a mental illness you see. All you need to do is tell whoever you are telling about all these other mental illnesses. That can get you help so you won't be doing this. It's not stupid of pathetic or anything like that because it is a genuine mental illness. And hey, if you tell someone you might have to go to a mental hospital :-)
There's something wrong with you. Everytime you go to the hospital you waste the hospitals money, time and resources. There are kids who are actually mentally ill and you're taking up a hospital bed that somebody else could be using. There are kids who struggle daily with their mental illnesses and who need imediate help! What the hell is wrong with you!.
Ironically, loving to fake illnesses and be in hospitals is, in itself, a mental illness. So in your case yes, this is very good, because now you don't have to fake a mental illness anymore, you already have one.
no its bad your going to ruin your life this one day these fake mental illness will come to you and your going to literally hate it so good luck then!
Fake mental illness? Nah, I'm pretty sure you are legit mental.

-No WAY !!! If Idiots are Racist- that's THEIR Problem ! -DON'T let Them make it -Yours !! And You CAN "Change" your Situation- by Making Yourself a BETTER Person than THEM !! Because the Better YOU Become ( as a Person ) the MORE non-racist People are going to Notice. And Your "point of Living" will Become whatever YOU- want it to Be. :)
No. Definitely not. Is there any way you could move to a kinder area? Look, I know you're going through a rough time, but killing yourself isn't the answer. I think you should also get a therapist. You are obviously struggling. I am so sorry you're going through this. Please don't listen to those people. They are ignorant, and they aren't even worthy of your time. I hope everything gets better for you. Take care xx.
No, but you should kill yourself if you're under 6 foot and male. Especially if you're black.
give people credit and a chance. People will like and be good to you. give them the chance to like you etc.
THAT HAPPENED TO ME TOO, BUT DON'T WORRY. WHAT I DID WAS BUYING SOME MEAT AND MAKE A NEW PENIS. I'll be more careful next time with my meatstick
Trot down to your local hardware store and buy a new one. I heard they're doing a 'buy one get one free' offer.
Penises don't explode. Next.
I'm wondering..did it feel good or did it hurt?
wake up from the dream your having
clear up the mess
seriously not true
nope!!
Swallow.
I'm shaking as I write this and i can't calm down I have a lump under my arm pit. It's inside. My armpit gets sore from time to time. The lump is an oval shape. I used to think i had my bra on too tight. Please help. I have irregular periods and sometimes I've lost my appetite and I have been sick. When I put both arms in the air my left arm feels quite tight. Please please help I'm actually begging. I live with my auntie and she is havin a lie down so I can't disturb her. Please please help😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
What you are feeling under your armpit is probably just a lymph node. You have over 500-700 lymph nodes throughout your body. Under your arm pit and under your jaw are two of the more common places you would be likely to notice one. Lymph nodes help to clear infection from your body when you are sick. When they are swollen, it's a sign they are doing their job.
Probably a swollen lymph node; the rest may be mental or a result of your body fighting off sickness. If it truly bothers you that much, though, I would talk to a doctor.
Also I've seen blood in my poo once and I've had constipation since I was 2. My left breast is bigger than my right. And it's the lump that's under my left armpit
It could be either a swollen lymph node, a cyst, or a carbuncle. Tell your aunt when she wakes up. She should make a doctor's appointment to see what it is.
Doesn't sound like anything important. Most likely a swollen lymph node...very common. Speak to your doctor he can put your mind at ease in minutes of seeing you. Tell your aunt when she wakes up. No big deal. You aren't going to die from it.
I actually had the same problem on both arm pits and it turned out my lymph nodes were infected and I needed surgery. Definitely get that check!
Please calm down, when you can, get checked out by a doctor,we all have little lumps and bumps on our body,under your arms there are glands as well, they sometimes get bigger, that is when you notice them.
you need to see a doctor
It's hard to say. I wouldn't overlook the possibility that you're depressed. You can take a depression screening test like the CESD R online. This doesn't diagnose a case but it should be able to shed some light on your problem. Could the problem be that when you're with other people, you're not "connecting with them"? I wonder of if the problem might have to do with your communication style. Are you shy? There are two books people say help a lot with this - How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie and Dying of Embarrassment by Barbara Markway.
You probably have depression which is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft; it's a great antidepressant but it takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it.
yes. its called depression.
yeah krystal, u have to get out more and get a job
I'm a 17 year old that has been having weird headaches for the past three days. It feels like pressure and hurts around my eyes and cheeks. I'm afraid it's a tumor. I have bad anxiety and am a hypochondriac. My tongue feels like its swelling, which happens when I get anxious and panic; but it's not helping the cause. Most likely it's a sinus issue, mixed with my anxiety. But I can't stop thinking about it. It's happened before; one time I thought I had bacterial meningitis, a tumor, multiple kinds of cancer, asthma, etc. Any reassuring info or advice on hypochondria is very helpful. Thanks, Scared teenage girl
Sounds like a sinus infection
You have AIDS Jk I'm no doctor but I think you should go to one
go see a doctor, counselor, therapist for your anxiety
GO TO THE DOCTOR>>>>BETTER BE SAFE THAN SORRY
Tell your mother how worried you are.
Excellent idea on the headache diary - but the source of your headache (HA) may be better determined per a neurologist, especially if it persists. You can request a certain test/procedure to be performed, but your cardiologist will likely follow a specific standard of care or guideline, depending on what they hear you say re: your history, as well as what they find on the physical exam. You might ask if a carotid Doppler would be in order due to the HAs, but it's entirely up to her. There are a host of issues that can lead to chest pain and headaches....
ask anything you want at the doctor, he should be able to discuss the pros and cons.the docotr asks you a lot of questions about your family for this reason, to decided what order to give you the tests. they are mostly one sided tests, and the order the doctor gives them to you starts with the general population occurance and if he has more information on your family, he skips some tests, and does the ones he thinks you need.You shoukld do as much research as you can and don't ever hesitate to ask the doctor anything you want.
Sigh.......I am sorry but I don't think anything is seriously wrong with you. Headaches are common, millions have them as headaches. Chest pain can simply be gas or anxiety. And since you've been to
Yes man
It depends on the doctor. My doctor is VERY opposed to patient self-diagnosis. Then again, you must be comfortable enough with your doctor to talk frankly with him/her. If your doctor can't figure it out, get a referral to a specialist.
In the UK, the basic rate of tax is 20%. That's paid on income up to £32,000 a year (equivalent to $46,500). If a person has any extra income above that amount, they then pay 40% on the additional income (so not on the initial £32,000/$46,500).
You would have a minimum of 50% of your pay taken in taxes; 65% is probably more accurate. Add "free" college tuition for all, and you'll lose 90% of pay. The government would eat your pie and save you the crust.
Countries with universal health care have 50% confiscation rate - I mean taxes - on income in the middle brackets.
In most European countries the cost is significantly Less,...GDP-wise, it's about 60% of current US costs. The current problem in the US is, half our "health care" spending doesn't go for health care....it just pays the middlemen.
50%. I think that is a good number, like most countries with social democratic policies.
Most likely less than I currently pay to greedy, profit driven insurance companies. And don't even get me started on the deductibles.
More like a hundred a week.
no. you would get the 20, if you're lucky.
The pills I have purchased from Prolargent 5x5 Extreme website have worked as advertised. Lots better than Levitra and Cialis . Wife loves the feeling I can now give her.
If they are truly free of stds then you shouldn't have one either. Stds are not created out of thin air, some one has to have an std in order to pass it on. The thing is this person could have lied or not been sure of their std status if they've been having sex with other people. You should get your self tested for stds to be sure. Next time ask your partners to use condoms to help reduce your chances of getting an std and if you're female of getting pregnant.
Not if you have a habit of having unprotected sex. By the way, the person you were with could have lied. Always use protection. And get tested and an educated. Try Planned Parenthood.
Even proof on paper isnt enough. Some illnesses have window period which prevent them from being detected on tests right away
If you are sure you are std free and this person isnt lying then you are free of it.
And this my friends is why children shouldn't have sex. And also, pay attention in health class ;-)
You too probably have it. There is a chance you dodged a bullet but see your doctor and sow him your genetalia
It's cûnts like you that deserve a dose
That's enough to get you pregnant. Live sperm can travel from outside the vagina to up inside. You're probably pregnant. Rent the movie "Quinceanera" it's about a 15 year old girl who is a virgin but gets pregnant from her boyfriend cumming on her leg. She has a hard time convincing her family that she is still a virgin, but goes to the doctor and proves it. It's really good. But the fact is, yes, it happens all the time.
Can I get pregnant off of my BF just cuming on the outside of my vagina?
No form of birth control is 100% effective, no matter who uses it. You might want a pregnancy test to be sure.
What's the question?
OK
Would be illegal for a porn producer to use anyone under age 18.
Anyone under the age of 18 cant be a porn star, THAT'S ILLEGAL.
i would prefer it to sex with boys
keep at it man. UR SOOOOO LUCKY. i wish i had a big pp
No.
No, they don't choose. It is a disorder. Many try to eat, but they just can't stomach it. It's not that they don't want to. And everytime they look in the mirror they see a deceived image of themselves, it is a disorder, but there is stigma and myths behind it. Read some articles to get some more knowledge on this subject
Excuse me, but it IS an eating disorder. It is getting caught in a loop in your head, that you can never be thin enough, even if you are dangerously underweight and always exhausted. You know NOTHING. Educate yourself.
Off course it is a disorder as these people feel fat when they are not fat, and have poor body image They have a compulsion not to eat, which is different from choosing not to eat
I've felt bad all day, started with some lightheadedness. This then progressed, adding fluttery, unstable feelings in my chest which have since turned into pressure/tightness, and then chest pain came too. In addition I feel shaky, have nausea that comes and goes, a slight headache, and also a low grade fever (100.4).
I've checked online on forums and sites like WebMD (it's not as good as a doctor, and a lot more panic inducing, but at least it's something) and the signs point to heart problems or anxiety as possibilities. It could be anxiety, I've had problems with it in the past, but it doesn't feel like anxiety. The problem with it possibly being a heart problem of some sort is I'm only 18.
No family history I know of for heart problems. I'm a healthy weight (105lbs for 5"2) but don't eat as well as I should, or exercise enough. Also life is pretty stressful, and has been for years. What do you suggest? I'm not going to the ER until it gets worse, but I'm worried that's a bad idea.
Most likely to be anxiety, possibly combined with an actual virus.
Talk to her about it
Sorry to hear that, Roger.
Talk to her about it, something is probably wrong.
go see a prostitute
Okay so I'm a healthy 15 year old girl but I'm worried about something. I have bruises and I don't know where they are from and I don't feel them and I also get a bunch of nosebleeds. I went to the doctor for my nosebleeds and the doctor just said that it was a common thing cause my blood vessels are just bigger. Everyone of my friends are telling me that I have cancer and it's really starting to scare me!
Your friends are obviously overreacting. They aren't medical professionals and they shouldn't make you worry. I would trust your doctor if he said that its normal. I know that my friend used to have the same symptoms as you but her nose bleeds have gone down a lot and she still bruises easily but that's because she is anaemic (low in iron).
Are any of your 15-year-old friends medical doctors with years of training and experience under their belts? I didn't think so. You don't have cancer.
You have nosebleeds and nothing else so dont listen to your friends, at the worst you might need your nose cauterised to stop the nosebleeds
Theyre probably just messing with you by saying you have cancer. If youre concerned then look up the symptoms.
IT IS A COMMON THING TO HAVE NOSEBLEEDS AS A TEEN!!! And exactly what medical experience do your friends have???? how would they know???
If it's really scaring you, get a second opinion.
None of your friends have any idea what they are talking about. You don't have cancer.
I've been going for quite a while now and I feel like it's useless and doesn't help me at all? its cbt and I feel like everything he tells me I could just find out online. I just feel super anxious before every appointment and I hate it. I hate talking about myself but I really try and it's not helping. but I don't want to go to my doctor and ask for medication because they might say "ur feeling depressed still because you didn't finish ur therapy sessions" I have therapy today I don't want to go what should I do?? help
These things are left to you own sweet will and choice. From here nobody will compel you or force you to change your present principled stand on this vital issue. If it is not a sentence I would have given you some other best solution. In future don't feel shy or hesitant to raise a solid question here.
sure, you and 90% of other people trying to deal with mental health issues the people who do continue to attend and make a genuine effort to honestly engage resolve their issues the people who rely on all manner of excuses to stop going end up wasting years just read your own question - you feel anxious at the thought of going - that means youre not even close to being ready to deal with it yourself rather are letting the illness win .. again
aww . i care .idk if ul listen or not but god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online
hi im 14 and i cant go to the hospital right now but for months now ive been feeling chest tightness and i saw a DR. and he said everything was fine but im worried ive searched for answers but found nothing could it be stress (idk what id be stressed about) and this tightness is only at night and i freak out could it be a sign of death or am i over reacting (again im 14 and its 1 am and i cant go to the hospital or call a doc. please no rude answers)
Anxiety (feeling nervous) can certainly contribute to the feeling of "chest tightness." If the doctor examined you and told you he had no findings that are worrisome, it's likely you're in the clear from having any serious issues. In an otherwise healthy 14 year old teenager, a non-painful tightness in the chest is not something I would categorize as an emergency or a "sign of death." Try some breathing exercising- focus on breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth with nice, slow, deep breaths. You'll be okay.
I had that happened to me, and my doctor also told me it was stress. I got fired because I went to the doctor and forgot to call work lol. Anyways just try to relax, drink some tea to help you relax, don't over think it coz it will stress you even more. If it doesn't change, just tell your mom or dad, so they can take you to another doctor/ hospital.
Search about Magnesium. It's also important for anxiety & depression.
I'm sure everything is fine when you can see a doctor or call one but for now don't freak out i'm sure everything is fine :)
I am 17 years old. i am going through depression and anxiety and all of the above. my mum is forcing me to get job and i just want to focus on my education because i am lacking behind on that and having job with it. will make it more difficult. i do want to get a job but that after i leave school and go to university and at the same time have a job. i am not ready emotionally and mentally to start a job and i told her but she never listens to me. i know she doing this for me and want me to have better life. But i am just not ready now.
There are some jobs that can be really easy and you could proboly do once a week. If you're really against it you could try talking to your mom about how you feel and what you think.
Try a volunteer job doing something you like. This will meet her half way, at least, and will spare you the pressure of having to perform. Almost any church feeds the homeless once or twice a month. Animal shelters are low key.
I walked out in the middle of my lifeguard training, because I didn't seem to be remembering everything and I couldn't seem to look at the instructor and take in anything he was saying .I quit my other job at the truck stop, There all I did was stock the cooler and listened to music or clean the bathrooms and showers. I cant even stay focused on writing this. PLEASE HELP
It sounds like you are really frustrated by these behaviors. Before getting concerned about a diagnosis and cost of treatment it is best to reach out to your family doctor to rule out other illnesses. Your doctor will be able to suggest treatment options if needed. In the meantime, stress and lack of sleep can often cause a person to feel fatigued. Make sure you are taking care of yourself by eating right, getting proper rest and exercising regularly. Reach out for support if you need to talk. Counselors are available 24/7 at the Boys Town National Hotline by calling 1-800-448-3000. Take care, Kay, Counselor Boys Town National Hotline
The first line of defense against depression and anxiety is B vitamins. Deficiency of niacin amide has various effects on social skills and attention span. Get nutritional yeast powder and/or B-100 pills. Vitamin B2 is a water soluble dye that turns urine bright yellow. When the color fades, it's time for another pill. Read some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right.
Pray. If you really want some wonders or miracles to happen in your real life,you should pray at least for two minutes daily. Your genuine prayers will never go waste. It will be rewarded. Or go for a thorough medical check-up, which will reveal the whole secret or truth behind your doubts.
Lately idk I haven't been eating much I haven't been hungry honestly but is this not enough? I feel if I eat more I'll throw up :/ For breakfast I had one cup of blackberries for drinks I had water and one Hugs which is 10 calories and dinner just 1 cup of blueberries (don't suggest meat I'm a vegetarian :p) but how much weight will I end up losing like this? Is that 600 calories a day even?
That is at max 250 calories. At this rate you will die in approximately 3 weeks without medical attention. You need at least 1200 (for female) 1600 (for male) calories a day to just do normal body functions. Please don't starve yourself. On the plus side, you will lose weight, but will also decompose because you will be dead.
That's about 110 calories, girl.
No it is not. It is less than 600 calories, and it will make you very sick. You can't just eat Fruit....
Yes
I have tried but it didn't pretty well. it's a little salty and kinda sweet at the same time but it didn't turned me on at all. well maybe its just my first and of course my last
Only for a man I love.
No, and I don't intend to ever.
Once, doesn't taste that good lol
after i gargle it
Most males have sampled their own product.
If that was true, that would be considered very large. Considering the average 13-year old is around 3 inches. But if you can get people to believe that, then good for you.
Yes, your penis at 6 inches is a very good size. It is a lot bigger than average for your age.
Pretty big! Mine at 13 was just 2.5 inches! I'm 28 but mine is small, only 4 inches erect.
Quite big for your age. Average adult size is 5.16 inches and 4.59 inches girth.
much more likely to be a bruise - never heard of melanoma under a finger nail
It is far more likely to be the result of an injury bit ask your parent or guardian if they yhink it needs to be checked by your docctor.
Go to doctor but it probably is only a bruise or bleeding under nail
Highly unlikely. Show mum with pic
your not a doctor and neither is google so go and see one
I think you are misguided.
This is an impossibility for nearly all men. The natural distance between mouth and genitals is far too great and one is not usually supple enough to get the mouth anywhere near the genital area.
Ask a doctor
Read Paul Feig's "Superstud". He has a whole chapter on how he tried.
Become a Republican and lecture liberals about how much smarter you are, basically the same thing.
You have to have a loose vertebrae and a long shaft.
If you mean suck yourself off? be careful of hurting your neck and back .also don't bite tour cock. good luck
Be flexible enough and you need to have a long d!ck to suck.
start with a long co ck
1) Crap first, and don't eat near the time you plan on doing it. 2) Condoms and lube. 3) Slow and steady. Don't let him shove anything anywhere.
you should reconsider Using lubricants can help some, but doesn't completely prevent tearing. Repetitive anal sex may lead to weakening of the anal sphincter, making it difficult to hold in feces until you can get to the toilet.
i would bl ow and po rk him instead
Just go head to balls in one stroke, and also the dryer the better.
It would be good to try and find a purpose for your life, a way that you can contribute. Can you volunteer somewhere, even once a week? Also, pets help a lot of people not be so lonely, you just have to get one you really like, and only if you can afford to take care of it. If your building doesn't allow it, see if you can get a prescription from your doctor. A lot of people are getting prescriptions for dogs or cats as service animals, to help with loneliness and ptsd. You can try praying and check out local churches. You can also look into support groups.
You probably have depression. Try to manage until you are at least 16. Depression is common but easy to treat. Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
You post this very often. That makes me think that you really want help and answers, but you are not taking in the advice people are giving you each time. Scroll back through the many responses you have gotten - there are good suggestions there.
It sounds like you are feeling lonely. Sometimes that can be a challenge. Sometimes it can help to join volunteer clubs. Do activities that you like to do ; golfing, etc.
It just means you aren't challenging yourself enough with difficult goals. I hope you start feeling better soon, mate.
it means youre spending too much time at home, you cant meet people like that
you should get a dog. they are great for depression, lonliness, ptsd, and will require you to interact with other people- taking it to the vet, going for walks, going for grooming.
Jeez...Maybe you can branch out and try to expand your "support network". or find something that makes you happy....
I am 16 years old, I m 5 2" and currently weigh 166-168lbs. I have been trying to lose weight since October of 2015 back then I was about 175-178. I want to get to my healthy weight which my doctor states is around 110-136. I am trying to get into an exercise routine but I have a lot of school work and studies to be done. I am also not in control of my meals my mom makes hamburger helper almost every night. does anyone have any tips that may help?
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing and by far the most effective pre work out supplement I've ever tried. It gives me a ton of energy to do a challenging work out and I feel uplifted for the rest of the day. I never feel discomfort or dizziness due to the caffeine levels and it relieves bloating. Great balance of ingredients .
Control portions of stuff you know isn't good for you. Do 30 minutes of exercise at least a day, even if it's just going for a walk.
I do portion myself and I admit some days I skimp.
Run, but not to the food table.
eat less, exercise more
let her play with your penis and if she wants to have sex with it go for it. its alot better than a dildo
She would probably benefit from a dildo. But do not have sex with her if you are biological siblings. That is incest, and is highly looked down upon and might even be illegal depending on where you live. If she gets pregnant the baby will have deformities, and it is not okay. However, get her a **** vibrator or a vibrating dildo. If you have any friends she might like, hook them up. Show her some porn or something like that that might help, too.
Sure she would love that, but a real penis will give your horny little sister a more powerful orgasm which will be more satisfying so she can get some relief from her hormones. If you both care about each other very much and you both want to do it then you can make love together. Just be sure to use condoms or birth control pills. Enjoy & good luck :)
Don't listen to the other trolls. Seriously don't have sex with your sister. If you think getting her a vibrator would help then go for it, just make sure she knows not to tell anyone that you got it for her.
She'd be happier if you found her a boyfriend. No batteries required.
a vibrator is not a gift a brother gives
Be a man. Give your sister a hand.
so? what are you waiting for, sale? go do her the favor and don't ask questions or tease her...
I've had this problem with my fore skin for awhile now. I'm 16 and I can't pull my fore skin over my glans to clean it, I've tried stretching it but I lost the time to and it just wen't back to how it used to be. I'm getting tried of having this problem and I want to go see a doctor about it. Please help me tell my parents about this, thanks
Just tell them, no need to beat around the bush about it. It is a legitimate concern. However, it may be better if you spoke to your dad first, he can filter it for your mother to spare you some embarrassment. Once you speak to him about it, simply ask him to set you up a doctors appointment.
Just tell your dad. Guys tend to be less embarrassed or bothered by male oriented things.
Without any hesitation tell to parents
you don't need to tell anyone, the foreskin will loosen up over time, just take it easy with it, stretch it little by little and eventually it would pull back.
You have to tell your dad about it first. He knows what to do and he will save you from embarrasment from your mom.
Seems a bit of a hypocritical question really if you don't believe in mental illness then there is no reason you cannot work.
Listen to your doctor so they can help you get better. I have a friend who has borderline and schizophrenia, and they too kept denying mental illness exists. Well, they had a severe episode that alienated a lot of their friends with their anger and paranoia and weeks later, they are still completely nonfunctional and can't do simple tasks like cleaning because it is too much for them to handle. Sometimes we need medicine to fix the chemical imbalances in our brains. Mental illness DOES exist. To deny it only hurts yourself and the feelings of any of your friends who have struggled with it.
How do you not believe in mental illness? You should, since you're obviously retarded.
You have borderline? You need intensive counseling to help you. Personality disorders such as this are extremely hard to correct. It doesnt matter if you "believe" or not. That is part of your problem. Get help.
Well you an idiot for not believing in mental illness.
Ah, you'll have to state WHERE you are. Because condom sizes are different around the world; an American or European LARGE is actually significantly bigger than an Asian LARGE. Not to mention how LARGE is actually what STANDARD condoms are labelled as everywhere; this is - yes really! - a simple marketing trick intended to make men feel good ('hey I'm LARGE') and to help the less well endowed the embarrasment of having to ask for a SMALL condom (but now you know that a REGULAR condom is in fact a SMALL condom).
Regular size condom.
It sound like a "snugger fit" condom will be best for you. Try them before you need to use them.
Buy several sizes/brands and try them on.
Small or snug fitting.

1. Hysterectomy/abortion ---------no relevance to brain tumour. 2. General Anesthesia has no impact on tumours. At the most a painful tumour can be painless until the impact of general anesthesia on the body.
: Abortion in any trimester may be associated with need for surgical intervention which may be associated with serious morbidity. Abortion in any trimester may be associated with need for surgical intervention. Hemorrhage due to low-lying placenta and previously scarred uteri are important indications for hysterotomy. Hysterotomies may be associated with considerable morbidity. The scar of hysterotomy has almost similar complications possible as with low segment cesarean section. The scar integrity in previous hysterotomy uterus needs to be studied. You wouldn't qualify I'm sure..
I am sorry about what you are going through, but please don't lose the gift of life which many people in the world do not have but you have, do not go with the abortion, you will realize what I am saying today when you see the smile of your little one Pls rethink, do not do a LIFELONG REGRET. Good Luck!!!
Hysterotomy abortion is similar to c-section so could they not just give an epidural for the abortion as they do for a c-section?, Good Luck
That is a serious medical question You really need to ask your doctor about that. No one here can know the specifics of such a situation and we cannot possibly know the implications of such a case. Get professional medical advice.
You need to discuss this with your doctor.
My psychiatrist & psychologist avoid the subject whenever I ask and I'm sick of it. Honestly, just having some idea of what I have would put me at ease. My meds: seroquel, wellbutrin, buspar Symptoms (even before the meds): -extreme lows and highs, but they don't last long at all (I'm talkin' minutes), and then I just end up feeling emotionless -extreme paranoia -detached from reality & my own body -I did hear a voice once when I was 15, but that was after I pretty much "lost it" I guess?
Borderline probably..... there are 9 criteria for it, you need to have 5 and you list 3. You could look them up if you want to. You can't be diagnosed until after the age of 18 but it develops in the teens.... the detachment is likely depersonalization which is a mild for of dissociation.... it's a criteria of Borderline....
You have a strong right to know your specific diagnosis. Ask them right out: "what is my medical DSM diagnosis." Tell them you want clear answers. Insist on it. Be forceful.
okay I am 15, on Wednesday I overdosed on 24 paracetamol 2 tranexamic acids 1 ibuprofen and a cold and flu tablet plus alcohol, I was taken to hospital and on a drip until late Friday where I was seen by camhs and aloud to go home, now I have a headache and sore upper stomach, like not unbareable but really sore, what could it be?
Just because they got the drugs out of you doesn't mean that they can prevent what they did while they were in you. They got the lethal amount out of you, but there's some that will sorta cling to your insides and while they mix and wear off and work their way out of your system you'll likely feel a fair bit of discomfort.
It requires some dent beating. Mind is bent on one side because of some unknown accident in life. Go to a highly reliable, trustworthy and good dent beater. He will do the rest.
See your dr again. Upper stomach could be liver. This can be damaged irreversably by overdose. They obviously have saved your but it doesn t mean you won t now have serious medical issues for the rest of your life.
I expect it's because of the overdose. It should get better with time. If it gets worse, speak to a doctor. I hope you feel better soon. x
Tell your doctor or the hospital if they did not tell you that these would be normal. Call 911 if it gets worse before then.
how aren't you scared of killing yourself. like i'm scared of getting a needle bro
Duct tape
You should seek a doctor Computer science can't help
hmm well a little too much info but i will recommend gorilla glue or expanding foam to fill that gap.
Does it make you feel manly to use such wording on a computer forum, you baby?
Super Glue will fix all your problems.
You are a butthole high on crack.
Get yourself some spackle and patch it.
Quick! Plug it!
Really???!!!! That's odd sew it shut and see what happens :)
I know there are lots of choices.

Nope. Just wave it around and make the other guys jealous. < M
You obviously don't know how to use a ruler to you kid
consult with doctor i do not know
Yes you are bigger than average.
average if you are afro american
sex power? right food - Figs, bananas, and avocados, for example, are considered libido-boosting. The way you feel about your body affects the way you feel about sex relieve stress, participate in sports activities, practice tai chi, or take a qi gong class.
No such thing as "sex power" so no way to increase it.
eat lots of beef burgers and dates
No. This is a normal symptoms of a common cold. If your fever increases or you feel lethargic or anything abnormal, then go to the doctor or E.R. I don't know how you people get sick with a fever because when I get sick, I don't get a fever. BTW, your too young for Yahoo!.
No, it sounds like a cold. Get some rest and drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated.
Probably just a cold. Talk to your parents if your that worried.
You should talk to your parents about it. Most likely you are getting a cold.
No dawg, you're good.
That's a joke, right? First of all, who would say something like that??? And second of all, 5"5 and 116 lbs is totally normal. Using a standard BMI calculator online, the normal range for your height is apparently 114-148 pounds, so you're on the far light side of it. BMI of ~19.3 is totally normal. I'm not a doc, but I am pretty sure that you don't look like a boiled egg!
Are you kidding whoever told you that is on crack. I'm 5'2" and 116 lbs and I'm no where near fat. I'm thin with an hourglass figure. Like a size 2/4 US. Haters gonna hate don't let anymore call you names. Whoever said it must be jealous
Dr Eggman off sonic.
The time for a pithy rejoinder is immediately after hearing the snide remark. Someone was trying to bother you.
No. I'm fat at five six and two twenty five
You're not fat, don't listen to them
if i was you i would of punched that person in the face and you sound fine too me
You`re UNDERWEIGHT.
No.
600 calories is really low. the basic metabolic rate burns about 2k calories a day for the average human being. Its not healthy to go that low on your calories even for athletes . Eat. As long as you eat healthy food youll be ok. Your hearth is pounding probably due to the lack of nutrients thus beating arder trying to compensate. Eat atleast 1.3k calories daily minimum to get the daily nutrients that your body needs
It's seem like your heart what it wants, he needs to quit outside you to flit a slùt and you should watch a stray heart video for example
you could end up in the hospital if you keep doing that... your heart has to work harder because it's getting no energy from foods
Because you are starving yourself and probably damaging your internal organs. Talk to your parents about your symptoms and EAT!
thats because you need like at least at bare minum 1200/daily
You're very energized and hyperactive.
Go to the drugstore and buy a product that kills them (I'm not sure what it's called but it comes with a special shampoo and a comb!). I used it every time I had lice and it worked. Also, get a lice spray and spray all of your furniture and wash stuffed animals if it's a child. You don't want lice again. Also, eggs may be laying around. And, if you don't want to buy anything, I heard that mayo works for lice as well! Good luck!
Get a lice comb, and comb your child's hair both in the morning and in the evening every day for three weeks. You might also try coating the hair with olive oil so as to smother the lice first so they are easier to comb out.

Go to the drug store and buy the treatment that the pharmacist recommends - one of the over-the-counter medicated shampoos. Use it exactly as directed on the container. No shortcuts. Read here for more information. http://www.webmd.com/children/features/w...
Soak your hair in Listerine for 30 minutes then wash it out and comb your hair.
start charging them rent. If they cant come up with the cash then ya gotta say "hey gtfo of there you bums"
There is special kinds of shampoo for this.
I'm gay and I've taking horse penis before.
Your fantasies are your own and they can be whatever you wish them to be as long as you do not act upon them (in the real world) without consent from whomever you may be with AND draw the line at causing pain, injury or death.
That would be wrong if your intention is to kill a guy in bed. Its your desire and pleasure to do it but with the agreement of both of you... I mean you are supposed to make love, not make the guy suffer in serious pain.
Yes that is a perverted concept to masturbate to.
At 15 your penis is likely done growing, since nearly all guys are done by then. Average length by 15 is 5.16 inches.
just like any other part of your body between 13-20ish it will grow longer, wider maybe there is no way to tell how big it will grow to be there is no way to make it bigger if you think it's too small yes sometimes they get hard for no reason yes they get hard while you are sleeping and can even have sleep orgasms called wet dreams yes you will grow hair and you balls will hang lower sometimes you balls will move around that's normal
It grows do to an increase of testosterone produced at puberty. First the testicle get bigger. Then they start making more testosterone. This hormonal increase causes the penis to get larger, causes pubic hair growth, facial hair growth, under arm hair growth, and the voice to deepen.
And what happens then? Do you think you will take the same path??? healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
It could be herpes if it's open sores. You need to see a doctor.
It could be any one of several STD's. You need to get checked or you could get very sick.
Could be anything. Ask your GP.
No. If anything an orgasm often stops the cramps for a few hours. It's just messy. Also - you need extra lube. Period blood contains small clots and other things that can irritate a bit so extra lube is suggested. Paper towels and a soft, dark colored towel for underneath help.
Sex ok if use condom as there is still a chance of pregancy but no disease unless one of you has ad std
no you don't and most women i know get extremely horny at that time of the month
No you don't.
Do you get horny when you're on your period?
Nope :) I've done both... a lot!
nopee
Get a very loud, bleeping alarm. Or a vibrating phone. You could also try connecting your phone to a very loud speaker if you really have trouble hearing it. But I wouldn't worry too much about today, don't we all miss our alarm sometimes?
OMG saaame!!! sometimes i hear my alarm clock 20 minutes after it's been ringing! i think that we're just really tired. we should probably start taking naps :)
It means you're sleep deprived. Did you know that teens need more sleep than adults? On average you need about 9.25 hours of sleep per night. The key is to get more sleep. Try taking naps in the afternoon if you can't get to bed earlier.
go to school now, that's what....maybe you need a back up alarm....like the one on your phone 10min after the other alarm.......and perhaps, you were really really tired or went to bed really late?! I've slept thru alarms now and then too, so you're not alone
Get a lamp timer and set it to turn on at the same time as your alarm .
Do you have a cell phone that you can set to Vibrate? Try that. You should be able to feel yourself vibrate. Put it under you hand.
Are you drinking the water? Sometimes people get sick from contaminants in the water they're not used to. It could also be an airborne allergen in that region.
It happens every time you go on vacation? Or just vacation in the South? You COULD be allergic to ignorance. It could be an allergy. I just couldn't resist.
I don't know why it happened in my life but it is very painful.
dunno
That's roughly twice the size of the average 14 year old. You sure you are measuring correctly? LOL
Yes, and your penis is a lot bigger than average.
Liar, liar, pants on fire. Now do you a question to ask?
im pretty sure he meant 7cm
So what, who cares?
OK.
Not sure what the question is-- but siblings can have different size gear since they can be different size physically.
You are maybe 11 in your brain dept... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
You haven't actually asked a question.
I'm circumcised and sometimes I don't unroll my penis to masterbate, is this okay...?
ok... what is the question?
If it was - every boy from the age of 12-13 would be dead. No - several times per day masturbation wont damage you. Quite the opposite in fact. Like an athlete who practices baseball, football, running, etc., you get stronger and better at things with practice. Think about it - it's a physical response. Practice makes perfect. Stay safe.
It natural. It's only bad if you substitute that for a real relationship with a real person.
masturbate more than once a day. masturbate much as you can and anywhere you can. it wont hurt anything.
it won;t affect anything
You're right. Midterms, man America was obviously on democrat's side. Oh and the special and state wide elections on November 3rd 2015 where 67% of incumbent democrats were ousted, 1 instance in which the 13 year incumbent democrat was defeated by a freshman green peace party member......definitely liberals winning.... And my favorite? The lying evidence destroying hard drive purging self righteous criminal hillary clinton who can't even keep moderate democrats from voting for Trump.....definitely a sign that liberals always win. Tell me, did your parents skip make you skip kindergarten through college? That would make a lot of sense.
Wish you were right. Unfortunately, Republicans have done a dandy job of gerrymandering districts - many of which have now been overturned by the courts - but it still gives them an edge on congressional seats. Did you know in the last election, Democrats got MORE VOTES for congressional seats than Republicans did - BUT Republicans won more seats? Yeah. Gerrymandering.
They only win in the US because the US population is filled with drama queens and f a g g e t s who will not survive nor fit enough to exist to the future. Liberals are like the typical German isis rape victims that are now crying like the dumb pathetic scum that they are for inviting the refugees to their piece of sh!t country lol
To the contrary, this next election will be the most interesting election in American History, even beyond the 1860 Presidential election.
Kind of hard to explain the Conservative control of the house and also kind of hard to explain Conservative control of the Senate to the point that THE obama can not even appoint a replacement to the court
It's not a competition. Competition is child's play (no matter what US Richclass Slaving Monopolists teach you). Grownups take serious stuff seriously. Feel free to join up anytime.
A little bit yeah
Nah, there is still suspense. The GOP seems to punish itself, so...
I am still amused by conservative politicians making bathroom laws.
they win now because people are unhappy
Any cigarettes are harmful. Even taking one in a lifetime significantly shortens your life. Even if you are the healthiest person in the world and you smoke one cigarette a day, you are way more prone to getting cancer caused by cigarettes.
Not that harmful. The main problem is most people start with as little as one a day, but the nicotine addiction takes over and becomes a habit.
I am a smoker and started like you did- i regret it everyday and i am 28, have asthma, and a lot of major chest infections. Cigarettes are a stimulant drug. No one in my family has these issues except me cause of smoking. Stop now- for the love of everything that's holy stop.
I would say yes. You may start with one a day then you may start smoking more
Probably 81 or 77% of all men in the world are scared knowing that 91% of all women smarter and more Maduro born make more better choices with their life than most men do
'rights' are a grey areas. Nazis had the right to destroy Jews under the Nazi regime. Would opposing that mean you were against the rights of Germans? .. well, yes, it would
When feminists use the term women's rights they are usually referring to policies that advantage women over men. Many women and men believe in gender equality so will be opposed to such one-sided policies.
I'll oppose "any" individual or group thats not in my best interest regardless of gender.
Men who are opposed to women's rights are selfish and want everything for themselves and to be able to lord it over women then too.
Because women tend to be childish about things. They want special treatment without putting up with responsibilities that come along with them.
because feminists are hipocrites.
While it is possible for a person to have three testicles, it is also very rare. It is far more likely that you are just trying to be funny by posting this as a troll question, which has been done so many times it is no longer funny OR amusing, except maybe to those who post it.
it's normal for them to hang lower but if you have more than one set of testicles you need to see a doctor
I don't think you should have three testicles... You might want to see a doctor.
you got three?
I'm 14, and I want to kill myself. Please don't tell me that I'm too young, because all I care is that I want to die, I'm not depressed or anything. Also, I know there are other ways to kill myself, but I don't wanna go out like a coward with pills, and if I don't get a gun I'm gonna jump. So don't answer if you're not gonna tell me how to get a gun, my mind isn't changing.
You can't get one that you but in person, but maybe eBay or something... But then again your parents might see it in the mail... I don't know... Just steal it if your that serious. Maybe not from a store but like a friend or someone that has a gun.
If you have the money you can purchase one on the street, but why bother, surely you have a high bridge, or building you can jump off of in your area. If not you can always find a piece of rope some where to hang yourself with.
please kik me (@the.real.slim.katy) .. suicide is not the answer, I've gone through depression and have been suicidal to the point of almost committing for 3 years. I'm 14 too. I promise it will get it better, i know it doesn't seem like it but it will. please talk to me i want to help..
Sane people don't believe anything he says. He is, in fact, the #1 liar of all the candidates, even beating Ted Cruz, which is hard to do. Trump's former campaign strategist says his goal was not to win, but to take 2nd place. Was just gonna be in long enough to get some marketing out of it. It shows. He has not thought deeply about a single issue. Just making stuff up. His only detailed economic plan he had to back up from when it was revealed to him that it would likely ruin the global economy. Nice one!
Because he's popular with ill-informed idiots. Not everyone who stands by Trump truly know what he stands for or how certain policies work - such as his plan for immigration reform. He's going to have a huge wake-up call when he starts trying to build that wall he's been talking about. If he does become our president I certainly can't wait for the dose of reality to hit his smug, ugly face.
It's down to Trump vs. Hillary. Forgive me if I don't think hillary is a beacon of truth and light.
Sounds like Hillary.
liberals didn't listen to EXACTLY what obama said in his campaign and now they are doing the same with trump like his response to the abortion question , he was asked " if abortion was made illegal again should the woman be punished as well as the doctor", he answered IF it was made illegal the woman should be punished but it wasn't ever likely to happen
He's loud and obnoxious when he does it, and there's a huge segment of the population that cares about style over substance. Basically, stupid people don't care what you say as long as it fits into their narrow world view.
Never Trump....
Hes your next President. So eat **** and die
And, that would make him different than Hillary.....how?
Cons are a special kind of STUPID LOL.
A hose won't fit into a penis.

Clean it as best you can with soap and water. Use some alcohol on it. Wrap it up in some bandages. Always wear gardening gloves when pulling weeds. You should have two or three pairs of gardening gloves because one pair is often dirty and yet there are still plenty of weeds left to be eradicated.
you have ediotahsicusidis which means your finger will fall off
you should smoke the weeds instead you dumb bich. also youre gonna die
why? rub some ice on it.
It's great that you are reaching out for help! We are so sorry to hear that you have been struggling. It really does sound like you have been going through a lot. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent, aunt, uncle, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. We would suggest getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
I struggled a long time with my anxiety I wouldn't sleep I couldn't go to school it was bad for a long time. I got over my anxiety by just thinking to myself if my brothers not worried why should I be. I would talk with your doctor as well if you don't think that will help they can point out good options suitable for you. people sometimes do yoga as well to help relieve stress which I think would be a good option that would be worth a try
Have fun wid family Meditate Yoga Play
You can't without causing death. Anxiety is a normal response to certain stimuli.
stop using the word.. I never even heard that word being used until the last couple of years and I'm 56. It's a nonsense term
Do things that you like to do. Have a hobby.
There's still hope! Don't give up. Someone will be the right one for you! Plenty of people have been WAY past that age and never been in a relationship. Good luck!
You have to first get help with your depression and anxiety. Work with a doctor to get past this. No one really wants to be with a depressed/anxious person. It's not pleasant.
addressing you mental health issues would go a long way towards allowing you to move forward in every area of your life
there is hope for everybody and all you can do is get out and meet people and give it time
im in that boat too. god is testing us to see if we can care aobut eeryone purely, love god and love good people who care when its hard. if u want a friend email camaro33125cody@gmail.com but please be careful online.
you should see a doctor, counselor, therapist.
If exercise on the first day of your period was dangerous, then how do you think the female athletes in the Olympic Games manage to compete (skating, running track, down-hill skiing)? You just KNOW that some of them must be on the first day of their period during competition.
As long as your exercise doesn't make you feel worse? As in, you had minor menstrual cramps but then you went for a run and now they are agonizing? It's totally fine to work out on your period. Many women find that it's actually helpful to minimize symptoms.
I play soccer when I'm on my period, even the first day, and it's fine. honestly nothing happens, and it's not dangerous!!!!
No, it's not dangerous. In fact, exercise can help ease cramps, if you're having them.
there is no problem running on the first day of your period... exercise is great for anyone, anytime.
No, it isn't dangerous, but may make any pain or heavy flows worse (I say that because it makes mine heavier).
No, it's not dangerous at all, your mother is so wrong.
Just put in a super tampon and wear a pad, exercise -may- increase bleeding or it may not, you really should be fine! http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12959...
no it is not dangerous, as long as you feel up to it
not at all. In fact it is healthy
TIP: Don't hold your breath Luk 19:40 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.
your know that christ will return and find out about the way you are and how you live your life you may think god won't help us but this is his master plan and i hope that sinks in!!!!!
Oh let me lick your tears...... You want to shut me up...you are gonna have to kill me
well there allowed an opinion as long as they don't shove it in my face
Only when Christ returns, but then it will be too late for the unbelievers.
never
You encourage them when you keep writing about them. You do know that, right? Duh ! ! !
Yeah WTF Susan
So, I'm a 14 year old girl around 5'2-5'3 and weigh around 101-105. Sometimes I feel like I eat too much, compared to a lot of girls from what I've seen, some days I do. I don't think I eat that much though. Sometimes I think I may just have a bigger appetite than others, I don't know. Is it normal? Is my body just trying to grow? Any ideas or advice?
What you should look at when you eat is the amount of calories it has in it. Depending on the amount of calories something has, you can eat a little or a lot of it. You can eat more healthier foods such as veggies, because they have less calories than fatty things such as cakes and candies. However, you also need to look at other things such as fats, carbs, sugars and so on. A 14 year old girl should be eating from 1,800-2,400 calories a day. Also remember it's all in moderation. You can eat cake, but don't have the whole thing! Have a small slice!
You shouldn't be bothered at 14 with what you eat, as long as you get excerise you won't really put any weight on, you should just keep eating the foods you love like normal. Try not to worry about it:) it's fine to have a bigger appetite, if you stop eating then your body will start to store food which will make you keep body fat instead of digest it
At your age your body is constantly growing. You keep needing more energy which is probably why you are always hungry. Give or take a few years, and the appetite will cool down. It's completely normal, and believe me, your friends will go/had gone through the same phase.
Your at a really good weight, I would go by that rather then how much you are eating.
Some diseases can be passed on from urine and some cannot. It depends on the disease the person is carrying and if the urine enters your body (very few diseases are transmitted through your skin). Nothing really to do with the persons age.
Some people do carry infections in their urine. Such as ecoli. If u touched the urine and washed ur hands u would be fine. If u went and touched ur mouth or a cut something then that would give the infection a way into your body. If in doubt about catching an infection, seek medical advice
Age has nothing to do with it. A normal person's urine is sterile. Even so, it would be difficult to get a disease from urine, as usually its E coli, and that is not a skin bacteria; its in your poop. It doesnt cause tactile infection.
No. The concept is ageist.
I have asthma and allergies. I'm 13, and my asthma was doing very well up until a few months/year ago. This weekend I've been wheezing and coughing up mucus (could be from allergies) and I went swimming VERY lightly. Just floating, some swimming under water, nothing intense, and I had to leave because I was coughing and wheezing badly. Could this be an immune system problem? I've also been getting colds and flus very easily even though I get the shots. DO I NEED HELP!? or could it be because the weather changed from cold to hot suddenly, or maybe hormones? Thanks.
Go see a doctor. Tell them all of the issues you're experiencing and they'll tell you if you need extra medication or not. Better to be safe than sorry, right?
The problems with breathing from swimming could be from the chlorine used in swimming pools and it sounds like you explained the mucus. You could talk to a doctor and they might check for other problems or prescribe you an inhaler to help with your breathing. Has this been going on for moths or years(big difference)? -My sister has asthma
Its better to be safe than sorry.
Jerk off
Hello. I'm not going to tell you things you already know. But you really should get help. I know it sucks. And I know you probably don't want to go. But it's for the best, just think about your friends, family they'd really miss you if you were gone... I almost lost my girlfriend to cutting a few years ago and I don't know where I'd be without her... those places are there to help, she hasn't cut a day since coming out. I really hope you feel better. No one deserves to feel this way.
Yeah yeah. You and thousands of other children who like to do this to get attention. It's getting old. How about thinking of something more original? Like I don't know...not thinking about yourself 24/7? Helping others? Finding a hobby? Grow up and stop the manipulative behaviors.
If you're just stating this question as a joke, it's not funny. Get ahold of yourself!
You would be hospitalized since the cuts are very deep and you did it a 2nd time. Hope this helps plz answer my questions.
Hmmmm. How about this??? QUIT CUTTING INTO YOUR OWN SKIN YOU MORON!!!
You should be worried and see a Doctor or the school nurse asap. And yes, they will call the ambulance if it's really bad. They'll pull over and take you depending on how serious it is. And then they'd call your parents or anyone who's registered as your guardian if you're a minor. If not , they'd call whoever is registered in your info as someone who is closest to you or a relative. It'll definitely cause a scene at school, plus fainting is very dangerous, so you should take care of it asap.
A lot of people mentioned low blood sugar but have you considered anemia? Whenever I was anemic I felt like that. I actually passed out in Wal-Mart and at my school. Have your iron levels checked if its low your doctor will have you take iron supplement pills.
Probably nothing until someone trips over you and gets hurt. If you feel light headed when you stand up fast, stand up slowly. If you are walking and feel you are going to faint sit down so you don't hit your head. It can be low blood pressure or even anxiety.
ive actually fainted at school and they didnt call an ambulance because i woke up shortly after and then my mom came to get me and took me to the doctor. i think they would only be required if you wouldn't wake up or your parents wanted you to go straight to the hospital because of a concussion or something.
Sounds like you are trying to make it happen. Talk about your condition with your guardians first, have them talk to the school and then worry about what the school would do.
Depending on your friends, probably get a penis drawn on your face
Other students will draw d!(ks on ur face
You should see a doctor about these symptoms.
If you're mind set and food choices aren't in conjunction with exercising then it's unlikely you will lose 50 pounds with exercise alone. Try cutting out sugar, wheat, and processed foods. Drink more water, less alcohol. Surprisingly less strenuous exercises can be more beneficial than running miles every day. Try mixing up your exercise regime and making it fun and exciting! Hope all goes well :) Goodluck
Eat less than your calorie maintenance level (around 600-700 calories less), prioritise protein in your diet, and STOP DOING EXCESSIVE CARDIO. Contrary to popular belief, running that much reverses your metabolism somewhat and depletes your muscles of energy and blood. Lift weights instead. One hour of an intense weightlifting session burns around 500 or 700 calories, and maintains muscle mass while revving up your metabolism.
Exercise is great for overall health, but you'd be disappointed how few calories it uses. The key to weight loss is about 85% diet--what you eat and how much--and 15% exercise.
Perhaps you need a balanced diet if you eat too less you will have vitamins defiancy, eg you need a certain amount of food intake everyday, you might be running too much because you don't take in much energy.you should also do different types of fitness because running will only help certain parts of your body
The average person has to lose 500 calories to start losing weight. My suggestion for you would be to eat healthier or see a nutritionist.
no
but a "cure" means to fix something that is wrong medically? Nothing is wrong with belief systems and mostly does no harm, apart from extremists but every group has those.
That is not a cure if you end up in hellfire, but deadly disease of sin and satanic lies.

I ask the same question of the almost nonexistent atheist population.
Turn them into neurotic atheists, you mean?
Why did even think of this?
you're the one who's mentally ill.
sadly you can't
Have someone else buy it for you. They may not see the exact item on the bill but if they have access to your Amazon account (or get the emails or texts), they'll know exactly what you bought.
Hahahaha - I know somebody who bought one of those!!! Save Your Money.
You could always ask a trusted friend to buy it for you.

How do you masturbate without lust? That doesn't sound very fun to me...
It means that one is masturbating for the physical pleasure. That a person is not fantasizing about having sex with another while masturbating.
Means you are making love to yourself-- most guys will jack just to enjoy their own bodies and don't necessarily have to fantasize about someone else to get off.
It's just self pleasure
Depends on the definition of lust.
than it's just masturbation

From last 1 month..I m peeing alot.Whenever I go to pee..it s normal but after 2-5 min I get feeling of peeing once more but when I go to pee.it like 2-5 drops that s it.I m just 15? Nope I m not diabetic.I haven t told my parents about this situation.I go like 3-5 times in an hour and all of them is just some drops.I don t go to pee in middle of night.This thing is annoying me now.
Need to tell your parents how frequently you are going- could be caused by a bladder stone or overactive bladder, and you need to see a urologist-- peeing that much impacts your normal daily routine a lot, so get checked out, might just need to take some antibiotics to clear this issue up, or a daily pill for a while to relax the bladder. May be embarrassing to tell your parents and more so to have a urologist examine you, but the end result is worth all that.
you should see a doctor, the most common problem that peeing is a symptom is is overactive bladder.
You could have Prostatitis. It is inflammation n the prostate.
Awh b. Xx when u feel like one is coming you got to say to yourself why are you panicking there is no need to and although it seems bad it will eventually be over xxx also start singing calming songs in your head xx if you start breathing heavily and your breathing gets bad cup your hands together and put them over your mouth it will act as a paper bag and will calm your breathing down xx that's what I do anyway ❤️❤️

Yes, you can get progressive lenses to accomodate your work. As you say, the top of the lens would be virtually no Rx (although your doctor may provide a slight Rx) and then the "add" portion of the progressive would be used for reading. Be aware, also, that there is an intermediate correction in the progressive that will help you see things in the intermediate range, so that will help also. Get a premium pair of progressives and they will give you the best vision.
If you are are fact far sighted, you should be able to do everything with single vision glasses. If you have presbyopia or another problem with accommodation, you will need to take off readers or wear progressive lenses. The question of which to use depends on what you need help with. If you have tasks throughout your day that you have trouble with, you may need progressive lenses. If you just have a few tasks that you have trouble with, you may be fine with readers. You may even do fine with over the counter readers. It would be a cheap way to check out one of the options.
One optometrist told me the time to get bifocals is when the patient begs for them. There's no going back from bifocals. For many years I wore driving glasses outdoors, no glasses indoors. Now I wear driving glasses outdoors and I have reading glasses available for the times I work at the computer but I don't not have control of the font size. In a few more years, it will be time for me to ask for those bifocals.
Progressives would be best so you can wear them all the time - the person that said to watch the size of the frame is exactly right - multi-focal lenses need a slightly larger frame. P.S. Multi-focal prescriptions are needed by people of all ages - my seven year old wear bifocals - with lines though - they did not want her to use progrssives.
Had you added your prescription it would have helped. And your age. Actual farsightedness is a distance correction. But if your correction is so slight it may not be an issue. I am farsighted with 20/100 in my right eye needing a +3.50 corrective lens. And i have used progressives for several yesrs with good results. I use an "Add" of +2.75 on the lower portion of lens for reading. I get my glasses at http://www.zennioptical.com - low priced online optical shop. Good luck.
No. There is no way you can be pregnant and if you don't know this already then you clearly shouldn't be doing anything sexual. It's probably your cycle sorting itself out
Since there wasn't any penetration and he had on a condom, chances are slim that you are pregnant. I think that stressing about your period can make it late. Try a pregnancy test for some reassurance. Good luck.
Where did you get your sex ed from? Because it is really sad when we read questions like your's and kids honestly don't know??? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pvw4tnP... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoBxbNrG...
Here’s a simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
Acne is usually hormonal if you're over age 20. If you're female you should talk to your derm or gyno, many birth controls clear up acne. As for products, too harsh ones are actually worse. Don't scrub or be rough just use a gentle was like Cetaphil or CeraVe twice a day and try sea buckthorn oil or rosehip oil. Acne meds can damage your skin.
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
I've heard rubbing garlic at night will clear it up in the morning- try giving that a try
You should go to your doctor because you took an overdose. The effects can be severe based on the medicine. Next time be patient and take one each day for ten days. There's a reason the doctor told you that.
Go to a doctor straight away! You could be feeling side effects from the medication but you've definitely taken an overdose and should see a specialist immediately
Get back to your doctor or go to emergency. F'n Idiot.
Go to the hospital emergency or at least your local doc. Maybe they can help. You overdosed, you might die
It is not surprising that you feel light-headed. I think that you are lacking a brain.
I'm sorry to hear that.
If you are not lying you are an idiot. Call your doctor.
Lord, I fear the future.
Penis enlargement doesn't work and, at 14, you still have a lot of growing to do. Come back in four years and tell us of all the changes that occurred. You'll be amazed.
Having a large penis with a wide girth is a blessin g for any man who even lived. If someone denie s that then he lyin g. I had an average sized penis but after using prolargentsize, I was able to increase the siz e and was able to erec t it for longe r duration. Prolargentsize is a true friend.
Yes, your penis at 5.5 inches is big and perfectly fine.
it's fine for your age
Something idiotic of course. Think of this: there has never been, in the history of humanity, issues with child rapists posing as women to rape girls in the ladies room. They are so paranoid. This is their last stand in western civilization. The world is growing up, but they think it's the 8th century. They have more of a home in an Islamic theocracy.
I think it's disgusting that grown men are now allowed into girl's restrooms. Our nation is going down the drain with it's moral decay.
Just stay away from glory holes and you should be safe. I thinks that's sound advice anyway, even if you're a Satanist.
They seem to be, instead of a frontal assault on LGBT rights, trying to chip away with it one small issue at a time.
Absolutely stupid, just like our Islamic Prez.
These are all great answers, but the best thing you can do for yourself is learn how to cook healthy meals. There is nothing more nourishing for the body than a wholesome, home-cooked meal. Learn how to work with fresh produce and how to flavor your food with herbs and spices. Cooking is simple once you get the hang of it, and it saves you money. :) If you don't have much time during the week you can cook meals ahead of time on Sunday, or figure out what would work for your schedule. I love cooking blogs. You can get a ton of easy, healthy recipes. Check out Pinchofyum.com
Eat fruits veg, Lots of healthy stuff drink water no enegry drinks. Eat carbon foods. Drink 1 bottle of water per day. Just eat anything healthy eat low fat yougurt
Lots of fruits, veggies, and grains. Load up on carbs. Very low fats so no oil, butter or processed stuff like that. Avocado, hemp seeds, and other nuts and seeds are fine in moderation. Vegan diet is the best way to go.
I'm really thin at the tip, and progressively get thicker as it gets toward the base, kind of like a carrot but not as extreme. At it's thickest it is just over 5" in girth. and is 5.5-6" long, I think thats a decent size, But it looks so weird. When I decide to have sex will it feel bad for the girl I'm with? Any insight would be appreciated.
I have a little secret which is that I am a player. I love to satisfy each and every beautiful lady I meet but for that I have to keep my man on its toes. These Prolargentsize pills have enlarged the girth and the size of my penis.
That's a fine shape! That means less painful penetration, and more than ample girth down the shaft for good stimulation. Partners with experience with be happy to see you.
No, it's unlikely she will have an issue. Most women think all penises are more or less equally ugly anyway.

Don't eat lots of dairy.

Please don't feel so bad about it, weird porn like that is out there because people like it! There's nothing wrong with you, you're just kinky it some crazy ways. It does not take away from your personality or anything else that makes you, yourself. Everyone does weird crap, there's nothing wrong with you. Don't commit suicide over something so trivial. Stay strong, pal.
I wouldn't say so, I see where you are coming from. But i dont see the solution to kill yourself. It would do better for you if you just stopped with all the things you feel guilty about. Push it away, open a book, find something else in your life. You don't need porn and the such. Just push it away. It's like an addiction to like cigarettes, pretty soon you start smoking more and more each day. So just stop now. Before it gets worse. And resorting to killing yourself is the worst possible solution. There are people who love you. Don't leave them like that.
I think you should get help like Therapy. If you feel ashamed from what you've done, you're not sick because you don't like what you've done. I hope you can feel better in the future. Good Luck

It has something to do with mental health only. There is something wrong somewhere. It will be known when both of you consult a professionally qualified doctor. Doctor can only diagnose. I do not want guess unnecessarily in a wrong way.
No. Be thankful you're dodging a bullet on this little piece of whackjobbery.
Being honest and correcting lies is never a bad thing.
This is a mental health problem. It's called an obsession. You have a fixed notion that this is a problem, except that nobody else has ever had this problem, and no medical study has ever suggested that it's a problem.
Did you know that's a lie? It's like saying masterbating will make you go blind
Absolute rubbish!
well i have done it that way for about twenty years and i have six children so that sounds like garbage too me

Ask yourself one question: What happens if I live to be 100 with nothing more than a cold or flu...where would all this constant worrying have gotten me." Your answer: Nowhere. Stop thinking, and start living. You are ruining your life at the potential of it being nothing at all.
Go to a doctor for a medical examination. That should determine if you're right or wrong.
Stop using Google to self-diagnose. If you are in pain or showing strange symptoms, I would schedule an apt Monday. If pain is unbearable, go ahead and head to the ER.
Ask a Doctor.
Then see a doctor for an actual diagnosis. Without that,all you have is hypochondria.
Doesn't matter how much you convince yourself. You don't have cancer.
Go to the doctor first 😊
Most people say that is is "more pleasurable". Others say that women like it more because it "seems bigger". Some women like it different ways. It's basically just a personal opinion. Just do some research on it. I have heard that circumcision at an older age is very painful and the recovery is long and hard.
There are absolutely no proven benefits to being uncircumcised, whereas there are many proven health and sexual benefits to being circumcised. Pleasure is not affected by being circumcised except that sometimes it is actually increased, especially if you suffered from phimosis.
the benefits is that you get a full penis. rather than half of the skin ripped off for a NO GOOD REASON :) not to mention its WAY MORE pleasurable Ignore "Cryptic"
Of course. Sex as Nature intended. 19,000 extra glide nerve endings, Protection from germs & viruses. Longer sex life. Much nicer to masturbate. < M
no benefits, except for the money the doctor get, and no, you have lost your precious foreskine forever

How many? 5? 200? What's your bone structure like? Beyond a few every day, pushups are strenuous. Once you get past 100, take a break every other day to do the opposite exercise, such as rowing with weights. If you don't, muscular development can be uneven. As for how much muscle mass you'll gain, that depends upon your diet and your genes. It will however, make your muscles denser, more defined and stronger. You should also add pullups and chinups to the mix. And do pullups with your fingertips, and chinups with one hand. Work toward doing pushups one handed, and on your fingertips and knuckles. You want strong fingers too.
well push ups will only help a few muscles and working the same muscles every day is not the best idea. you build muscle in recovery not while working out. also you need to make sure you are eating enough calories and protein if you want to gain muscle. it's not a simple as , do push ups and get huge.
Not that big. Your body will get used to it and any gains would slow down.
a few months won;t do much

Removing a testicle is only needed if it's cancerous or dead due to torsion or another accident. Visit a (your) GP and explain the issue. Might be many different things. A vasectomy will not solve any pain related issue. (Not counting your wife holding them while she gives birth :-))
No- need to find out what is causing the pain and fix the cause. Vasectomy would do nothing re pain.
Yes. And chopping off an arm would solve a cut finger. How would vasectomy stop pain. Use some logic. < M
You can also remove the other testicle, so you will not be able to compare which one has the pain.
A vasectomy will nOT take your pain away Bur its not normal to have pain in testicules see a doc
no no no, look at how nerves are arranged in that part of the body: problem could be in another place at all!. you have to check your doctor...
Well, as a widow myself at 34, now years later, I guess some people might not ever get over a loved ones death but I think sometimes it's also our attitude of letting go, moving on, raising kids, living life. I got involved in a bereavement support group, started volunteering with hospice, started helping raising my niece. Good luck to you. Email me a serenee@ymail.com if you want.
my dad passed away 4 years ago, im only 13, my sister is 10 and my mom is 36 and none of us have gotten over it, its a natural thing. (who wouldn't be upset over a loved one who has died?) he died at the age of 34 because of a blood clot in the lungs (caused by smoking)
You never "get over" a death. You eventually adapt to living without the person, but that doesn't mean you don't miss them. You always miss them. It always hurts. It just hurts less.
You were asking about preparing for anal sex with your boyfriend 20 hours ago. I wouldn't recommend a career in creative writing for you.
Your questions make absolutely no sense..all of them. You are a kid...who has nothing to do. How is your BIRDS Panic Attack? And when is your boyfriend going to give you anal? I would be worried your "WIFE" might roll over in her grave.
You never get over it. After some time you get used to it, so memories become mostly pleasant again rather than always painful.
I read through your other questions and your previous one said - my bf has been asking for a while to do anal? How can this be when you tell us you live alone? as for someone dying you never get over it but learn to live with it.
sorry to hear that.. but as they say, it takes one to forget one. :) people may seem to think they will never get over it, but it is possible to. do the things you love to do such as ur hobbies. and hey, God maybe is calling you. and telling u something. your problems are nothing when you are in His presence. Pray. Lift up all ur burdens to Him. :) Hope this could help. :)
Liar. New accounts should really stay away from the cancer section. We have people literally trying to stay alive from day to day and have little to no tolerance for nonsense like this.
Shalom Tristan. Please take your meds. In regards to your asinine question, no one cares about circumcision because it is harmless and has many benefits (including not smelling of tunah, like you do) whereas FGM removes more than just flap of extra skin (FGM on males would be equivalent to chopping off your d'ck head and balls... which maybe wouldn't be a bad idea in your case).
Stop ranting about nothing!
because there is NO comparison... duh the female body is butchered deliberately so she can not enjoy sex the male has a tiny piece of skin snipped and he can still enjoy sex where is the suffering for the male... ???
"Is it okay to have black outs while standing up? (I m an 18 year old female)?" No it is NOT ok to have blackouts, while standing up. it doesn't matter whether you are eighteen or ninety eight, female or male. Having blackouts while standing up are a sign that something is seriously wrong, and needs to get medical attention, at the earliest possible moment. There are any number of causes for blacking out or more like passing out while standing up. So seek medical attention immediately do NOT put it off.
No, it is not okay, and not normal. Something is going on. There are numerous things it could be and you need to get to the bottom of it. You need to see a doctor.
Why would it be ok, definitely a sign of something wrong. See a doctor
No as that person could fall.
check your blood sugar, it may be to low.
You need to become a lot more savvy when it comes to health. The internet is awash with rubbish. Nothing you ingest will alter your "body pH", and you wouldn't to. If you're otherwise healthy, your body maintains pH within a tight tolerance; any change from that means hospital. If you ingest ACV it will be neutralised immediately by your stomach acid. Putting it on your skin has no proven benefit, but plenty of risk.
If you try to 'fix' your already balanced body pH, you will either kill yourself or become very ill. Besides that, your digestive enzymes work 24/7 neutralizing acids and alkalines as soon as they enter the digestive system. Your best alternative is to do a bit of study. Biology 101 is a good place to start. 5% acetic acid AVC lacks any proven health benefits, does not treat, prevent or cure any condition. http://junkfoodscience.blogspot.co.uk/2008/04/houston-we-have-problem-apple-cider.html https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/297?manu=&fgcd=
ACV is a FOOD FLAVOURING, is has no medical affects at all. The European Standards Agency investigated it and its a Con. It is Acidic and can burn your skin.
I ve been dealing with depression for the last 2 - 3 years, and I ve been feeling very lonely as of last year. My family doesn t take mental problems seriously, so I cannot turn to them. Among my friends, I ve always felt neglected and unaccepted, and they honestly aren t able to give me the emotional closure that I need. As an introvert, I find it difficult to make friends. So, supportless and friendless, how do I deal wit my loneliness and depression?
Therapy would help. A therapist could help you find healthy and safe ways to address your depression and reduce your loneliness. Just being with a therapist would give you the chance to practice your social skills. Other than that, get involved in something that interests you and gives you joy even when you're alone -- painting, photography, hiking, meditating, cooking, etc.
depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain does not produce sufficient Serotonin--- Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person. ---- I was a socially crippled introvert too but Zoloft helped me over that. I even have more energy now.

You're 12 or13. Your father is average your mother below. You'll stop by 15 not later. Nothing you can do but wait. None of the snake oil remedies work and all the ideas about exercise stretching drinking milk eating vitamins etc and sleeping are all complete rubbish. You are likely to get taller in the next 2 years but it's not guaranteed. I'd guess you'll be a little taller than your mother but it is a guess. If you can find out your height at age 2 double that for adult height. None of the other predictors are any use whatever.
Well I know you grow a majority in your sleep so I would make sure and get as much sleep as possible.
take enough calcium,vitamin d and zinc food items.these foods help you to grow taller fast.
Not possible. You grow as much as your GENES allow
I'm a female, around 5'5 and am 13. Last summer I decided to lose weight has I was considerably overweight. In the past month I reached a healthy goal weight (116.2lbs) but when I weight myself yesterday I weighed 116.4, I thought it could've been water so I weighed myself again today and weighed 116.6. I haven't changed my calorie intake or anything so why the gain?
Honey, as a 14 year old who is 170 lb, i know the struggle of being overweight, but 116 is a healthy weight for a 13 year old. If you're that concerned about it though, you have to maintain a healthy diet and exercise _at least_ once a day in order to stay the same weight. Also, drink lots of water.
Em that's really weird but i believe it's water! Do you usually eat something after 6/7 o' clock? Because if you do, it's not good. The calories almost double if you eat something at night ☆ Sent from iOS Dr. Know! 1.0.01

If a condom is used as directed it is 99.9% effective so there is no need to take the morning after pill. The morning after pill is not intended to be used as regular birth control.
You do NOT ever use the morning-after pills as an adjunct to a condom or to any other form of birth control. It was NEVER intended to be used as a method of contraception. It is ONLY to be used as an emergency measure in case of unplanned, unprotected sex and it is NEVER to be used more than 2 times in a year. When the morning-after pill was approved to OTC sale, I thought that was a good idea; but the number of questions such as yours are making me re-think that. Young people are not using it as it was intended, so perhaps its sale should revert to "prescription only".
Yes but there is no point in taking the pill if you are using a condom since you can't get pregnant unless the condom breaks which is highly unlikely to happen unless he puts it on wrong
the morning after pill is for emergency only. no it is not safe to take when you don't need to and is not worth the side effects and risks associated with it. you are not meant to use it as back up birth control
Shouldn't need to take the pill if the condom was properly used and it didn't leak in you deep.
you'll be fine

Growing up, my parents always said to brush your teeth before eating so that you get rid of any bacteria growing in there overnight so you don't eat it. Other people say to brush afterwards, to remove bad breath. Now I just brush teeth. eat. brush teeth again. If i don't have time then I skip the last brushing with a quick mouthwash rinse. :)
Because, one of the reasons people brush their teeth is to have fresh breath. Brushing your teeth then drinking coffee and eating bacon/pancakes/eggs/whatever doesn't give you fresh breath.
No idea, but it's bad for the enamel on the teeth if you eat breakfast first
It is recommended that you brush after every meal.
I really don't know I guess they just like to
Because that is their habit. It doesn't matter that much which order you use.
Goo see a doctor. There are dozens of treatments available for bad periods if the stuff available at home doesn't work. Worst case scenario you can go on continuous contraception and just *not* get periods.
You should see a doctor about that, could be a condition called endometriosis, this can cause your symptoms. Definitely get it checked out.
so talk to your mother, they have stuff at pharmacy for that and/or see a doctor
Yes. Here mental health is only given highest predominance and emphasis and all other issues are secondary. For your kind information, my uncle does similar dramas in our house.
Sounds like dé·jà vu.
Yes, God doesn't exist at all.
That's your belief, not mine. You are entitled to believe whatever you want to. It takes faith to believe in a higher power, if you've lost your way that's your business. I choose to believe based on my life experiences and that's my prerogative. No one has the right to dictate what or whom I believe in. Don't come out trying to dictate your beliefs to me, your just wasting your own time.
God is written on every blade of grass. And you claim He does not exist.

Its at the part where its crusted , a little yellow and some whitish, but the crust seems to get really soft once the cold sore gets wet and then once it drys, it crustes all over again. I dont know why? I have never had a cold sore last this long, typically up to 4 days but then again this is the biggest cold sore i've ever gotten because it accidentally spread
Unfortunately you can't make it go away faster at this point. It should be much better in about 5 or 6 days. A typical cold sore takes about two weeks to heal without any intervention. If you get cold sores often talk to your doctor about it. A prescription for the anti-viral medication Valtrex could help you a lot.
They usually last anywhere from five days to a week. Unless you have a specific condition which causes it to flare up more constantly and in longer duration.
14days minimum
Well, you are not too old to start but most guys start at 11 to 13. Go for it. Just solo sex, safest sex you can have and there is no health risk with simple masturbation. Won't impact growth of your gear or height or anything either. So most guys you know are probably already masturbating and some have been doing it for several years.
Yes it's ok. Enjoy it. I started masturbating when I was 13.
Compared to many, you're a late starter. Nearly everybody masturbates in their teens (and often for a lot longer) even if few will admit to it face to face.
Of course. Ignore the religious rubbish. A lot of boys start at 10. < M
Masturbation is normal, natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. It is never too early to start so your fine. I started masturbating at 10.
It's totally normal, and not something you need to get hung up about. It will not hurt you in any way at all.
And? What seems to be a problem? healthy-relationship-dating.com/masturb...
hell ya, I started at age 14.
masturbating at that age increases the chance of you growing hair on your palms.
It is okay and enjoyable, too. Will do no harm to you.
I keep having hot flashes and I can't sleep and I cry a lot because I'm scared for my mothers death. There's no reason she would die. It's just I feel like it might keep me from going to school because I can't stand being away from her and not knowing if she would get hurt or whatever I just don't know??? I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. That may be it?
I'm 13 and I have the same problem! When I am at school or away with friends I always have anxiety (I have an anxiety disorder too) and I always think of these silly reasons that she could die! You more than likely have separation anxiety... What I do is I listen to music or just try to think of something else! If you are really concerned then I say every hour or so text her and just check up on her and make sure she is ok. If it get's really serious and it's all you think about then I say confront your mom about it and maybe you can get started on some pills for anxiety.
I'd say yes it's because of your anxiety, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder. Do you see anyone? Therapist? It can help a lot and it's been helping me. I use to not leave my house becuase of it and my social anxiety and depression. But with help from my therapist I'm able to leave now. I still have panic attacks and I still worry but I'm working on it.
It's anxiety. You love her and the thought of her dying frightens you. Talk to your doctor about your fears.
You worries for your mom could very likely be connected to your depression and anxiety. It is normal though for kids to worry that something will happen to their parents. It is a very common fear. Talk to your mom about it. Tell her how you feel. She can probably help you work through your fears.
Tell your parents. They will not hate you and in fact will be much better off if they are able to get you help than if you act on your thoughts. Do not expect them to figure out what you have been hiding from them. They can not read your thoughts so waiting for them to notice your suicidal thoughts is never going to get you the help you need. That bupropion, depending upon the strength of the tablets and the time between pills, could very easily cause seizures. Seizures can be fatal. Talk to your parents.
Just keep yourself hydrated if nothing changes I'm sorry but you'll need to go to the hospital and be admitted and as you are a minor your parents will be notified .
When you won't be interrupted, call a pharmacy and ask to speak to the pharmacist. Don't give your full name. Call ASAP.
I'm sorry, it's a horrible feeling when you don't get support from those that are supposed to love you. The world just seems such a selfish place and it's getting worse. I made up my mind that I would find my way and make it through despite everything and that people weren't going to help and maybe I was better off that way. I read the book The Road Less Traveled by M. Scott Peck. I had to read it several times and also practice meditation but I am getting stronger. It is available online in PDF.
Talk to a dermatologist about what to use to fade scars.---- You might have clinical depression which is common but easy to treat. It means your brain does not produce sufficient Serotonin--- Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant.----------- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it during which time you may have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will gradually become a whole new healthy, happy person.
Find yourself Girl or Friends who is Girl, It Helps you and gets your feeling better, it doesn matter how ugly or what you have, Scars arent worst, scars are awesome and they look really cool ( my opinion ), Try to get some connection with girls! it Really helps!
Go to counselling
you are blessed my dear also depends? what is your definition of eating a lot maybe your friends and you think you eat a lot but your actually eating a normal amount ?? also 13 is the age metabolism is at its peak when I was younger I wwas like that to once I reached 15 16 I gained a bunch of weigh and believe me I was eating the same
You are growing and that is what the food is going to. However I would recommend you to eat more healthy because you could get diseases that affect your health... or you will get fat after you stop growing.
I think this is gift a real gift
drink protein shakes
YOU are soooooooooooooooooo lucky
You are more then likely not done growing. But even so yes some girl will fall in Love with you for who you are not your height. Good Luck.
Shut up and keep watering your toes daily

A police detective will not drop a case if you tell them to. It's up to the DA whether they want to pursue charges or not, not you
If you mean a police detective, then no, they don't have to stop a criminal investigation because someone involved in the case asks them.
It isn't your call for sure. It up to the evidence and if you committed a crime no prosecutor will drop the case. That is what your attorneys are for.
No. That's like someone killing your mom and then you telling the police "It's ok. I don't want you to press charges against the killer." A crime is a crime. They have to do their job and investigate.
Private detective - yes. Police officer - not your call, they investigate any crime.
No, they won't. If you feel you're at harm if they persue the case make your concerns known.
Unless you're Columbo ..no
I think you have to take him at his word
No, but if you never wash or clean, you're much more vulnerable to sickness and disease, which can shorten your life span.
no, for others near them to live.
No but it makes him smell good to other women.
No, but he needs to live alone..in the woods.
No, a shower will work just as well ...
It's all good, works as a good enhancer should. Feel a difference, get real big for longer time. Good Prolargent 5x5 Extreme Pills, I open the cap and take it with my drink works extra good.

Then you probably think wrong. The only way to know you have lung cancer is to see a Dr. If concerned for your health, don't smoke.
Not from smoking today but if you continue it puts you at a higher risk but alcohol and junk food put you at the same risk - I have smoked around 10 cigs today and its only lunch time.
I don't think you do go see a doc bruh
No you do Not. three joints do not give you cancer.
shut up
Hey so I want to talk about my health, a girl asked me for sex, she's 25 years old female and I'm 16 years old boy, i told her I'm not ready yet, but she said yes you're ready, don't say its rape, i don't think its rape, she asked me for sex, I've never had sex before, she did have sex with a lot of guys, so if i have sex with her, will my penis hurts after sex? or when i pee? Because she's an adult and I'm 16? How can she handle sex more than me?? And will it hurts at first or at certain age??
Unless you are doing something terribly wrong, or having sex with some sort of animal... Sex is never painful for a guy. And despite what you refuse to believe... A 25 year old woman having sex with a 16 year old boy is legally statutory rape. Don't live in denial kid. Another thing to think about... It says a lot about the character and stupidity of a woman that would even want to have sex with a boy.
Don't have sex with her. Besides being against the law to have sex with you because you are a minor, you are definitely not ready for sex. When you say "I'm not ready yet" and someone says "yes you are", that is rape, whether you agree to it or not. You aren't ready and you need to let this woman know to leave you alone. Get your parents or the police involved if you have to. It's not worth destroying your future or hers for one night of fun.
(A) That's not legal, considering that you are underage (B) she could have diseases, considering she has been with multiple guys (C) If she doesn't have any wisdom to stay away from a situation that might land her in jail, she probably doesn't care much about whether or not she gets an STD or gives it to someone else
Yes it will hurt. You might want to chop it off after.
No, it shouldn't hurt after. Wrap it before you tap it since she sounds promiscuous. You don't want any nasty disease incubating down there.
I lost my virginity about a week ago to my boyfriend, and when we first had sex, it didn't hurt just felt like a lot of pressure from my vagina stretching. But I didn't make any noise. And then yesterday was the second time we done it, and all I did was breathe heavily? No noise at all? I'm not gonna fake it and I don't wanna force it, I just wanna know why I don't make noise?
Not everybody does. All that noise making stuff is mostly overacting in the media and pornography. Communication between the partners is important, though. How else will he know what you like and don't like.
because some people don't feel a need to make noise. real life is not a porn movie
had you never watched fake prorn sex, the thought to ask why, would never have occured to you. some are quiet, some are moaners, some are screamers....don't worry about it
Noising is only to show pain which do not to habitual sex active women . So it is more than normal
It means that whatever you have been doing is improving your mental health and to keep doing whatever you've been doing.
Keep doing what you're doing.
means your doing well
your doing a good job
Yes
Yes, your own urine may cure your liver issues, provided you are not diabetic.
After your scan get some psychiatric help
Well if you do it will harm your liver even more.

Palestine would be good because the regular heterosexual couples aren't helping each other much. They need to try something new! Palestine is practically a concentration camp, for all intents and purposes, anyway. Send them a rainbow. Too many LGBT are in cities and they need to find safety in the protected area of "Sham". The "powers that be" respect LGBT and that benefit might spill over onto the Muslims.
Noware as they shouldn't exist
Thailand since they Bangkok.
LGBT people should be treated for their sickness but not treated rudely. We could send them to conversion retreats to help rid them of their sickness but only if they wish to be cured.
Spoken like a true knee-jerk republican asshole. Republicans need somebody to hate..... hate is what sustains your ugly, horrid party.

Most guys finish growing down there 14-15 but some finish at 13. Adult average size is 5.16 if bigger than that you are above average. Doubt it would grow this late.
No it doesn't effect it one way or the other. Testosterone is what makes you want to masturbate but doesn't increase or decrease because of it.
Never
At this point it shouldn't really change in length. It make change in girth though. That is what really please women anyways.

NO, real starvation does NOT destroy cancer cells! If that were true, most people diagnosed with cancer would go and get healed, right? We lose real doctors every day to their own cancer. We lose children every day to real cancer. If starvation was a sure cure, all those kids, doctors, awesome people and those down on their luck would be out playing in the sunshine and loving life.
Perhaps you should use the term "fasting" instead of starving. Anyone can go on a fast, (going without food, except drinking water) for an extended period. Be it 1 day or 40 days, it can be done once you reach your desired goal - cancerous cells will die. Fasting is the only way to normalize your body both internal and external. If you get your hands on a book called, "The Science and Fine Art of Fasting" by Herbert Shelton, you will understand.
Hmm! A simple drug-free way of curing cancer. I have a new conspiracy theory: why is the medical profession internationally hushing this up? Must be the Illuminati (whoever they are) with involvement of POTUS, who so many 'patriotic' Americans loathe. Or something like that.
It won't heal anyone.  The cancer cells will continue to grow and the patient will become too weak to undergo effective treatment.
Only in that starving yourself for 40 days is likely to cause you to go into multiple organ failure and then your cancer will no longer trouble you (because you'll be dead/dying of multiple organ failure instead).
No, it will not heal anyone. If you are starving cancer cells of nutrition, you are starving every cell of nutrition. And you brain will die long before a tumor does.
This video will show you how to cure cancer although no any Dr will tell you about it because they don't make any profit out of this
40 days will be harmful, however a fast one day a week, water only, will enable your body to begin repairing illness. Friends With Cancer, email fwcfriends@optusnet.com.au, has more info on that.
NO . But going on a alkaline diet might help a little which means eliminate all sugar from your diet
It'll spread more rapidly.

With that overhang and stretch marks you easily look over 200 pounds.
In all honesty, in this picture you do. But your picture is focusing on your stomach, if there was a full picture of yourself it may not be the case as it won't be zoomed in so much which makes everything look bigger.
You again? Go to a 12 step meeting or something.
You look more like 265lb. Get new scales and stop eating so much you disgusting fat pig.
Actually, you do....but only by a little. Do you hate me now?
sadly yes you do
That's totally stupid. Why would you do it one time, and what happens if you really, really like it? You're certainly not going to stop at one pull.
No, one cigarettes can not damage ur body, but you will be addicted in smoking.
I smoke 30 or more a day. Chill out, you aren't going to die.
One is all it takes. And then you are doomed.
At 13 your risk of breast cancer is statistically ZERO. What you are describing does not sound anything like breast cancer. This could be an allergy or it could be something like measles. Important that you tell a parent or guardian and get this checked.
Cancer can present as discharge, mass, mastalgia(pain). First differential on case of rash is rarely cancer. Breast cancer more commonly referred to as ductal and lobular histological variants occur extremely rarely at your age. However, secretory carcinoma of the breast is known to occur at young age and that too is extremely rare
You're a crazy, imaginative kid with ZERO chance of b. cancer. Rashes are typically not b. cancer and since you're a CHILD, your age prohibits you from having it. Anything you're experiencing is puberty or boob growth. Total imagination.
Not even remotely close to being breast cancer in any way shape or form. Allergic reaction....See your doctor.
Breast cancer does not involve a rash.
Sounds more like an allergic reaction to laundry detergent or leaving on a sweaty sports bra for too long.
You do not have any symptoms of breast cancer, and you do not have it.
not bloody likely...[[ http://www.earthclinic.com/cures/rash2.h... ]] there are plenty of sites like that out there to help folks.....the more you refer to those sites, the more you'll catch on to how to heal yourself.....best wishes

Answer: No, only OJ but that's about it. Maybe a Gatorade here and there. Soda, once every 3-4 months or so, candy is about 2-5 times a year, deserts around 6 times a year. 1. No 2. No 3. No 4. Yes 5. Yes, I tend to burp after drinking soda.
I can't stop myself from eating sugary oily food 1 yes 2 no 3 yes to lose weight 4 yes 5 no
Not often but I do consume a half pound jar of runny honey each month but no sugar. Reason no sugar is because of my ancestors who were Quakers who refused to have anything to do with eating or wearing anything which might have been produced or made by slaves. Some even starved themselves to death rather than work American imported cotton in the Lancashire mills when perfectly good cotton was available from India where the workers got paid, at least something. Sugar will be the death of the young generation. For my generation it was rationed in WW2 so we mostly never got any or very little.
I rarely eat any sugary drinks or foods. I've given presentations in school about the negative affects of these food. Especially sports drinks which are more dangerous than they claim to be
Only every two hours😄 Oddly I feel best when I eat junk. I feel better than when I eat healthy. I do want to cut down on sugar. In the past I had periods of practically no sugar...now I'm back to binging. I tend to go to extremes. I feel tired a lot but I take several meds which can cause fatigue. I only get hssd from healthy stuff like raw veggies.
Yes, but the answer to your questions above are 1. No 2. No 3. No 4. No 5. Yes

When I woke up in the morning I feel sad all the time that I wish I could still dreaming and sleep again . later on , I don't have appetite to eat breakfast,lunch and dinner and I don't have a girlfriend , have a few friends and I'm always alone in my house and always bored but I have a family actually :) I wish I want to be happy al thel time and find my happiness. If u all reading this thanks and I hopefully that someone helps me
Find something you enjoy. There has to be something. It could be a hobby, it could be a person you enjoy spending time with, it could be just general stuff to improve yourself. Maintaining hygiene and doing exercise might not seem "fun" but after about a week or two you'll want to do it on your own because it's mentally satisfying and it just makes you a bit happier, then you'll be more motivated to do other things.
It sounds like you may be depressed. Whenever I'm inside all the time My depression kicks in, so I usually go for a walk just to get out and get some fresh air. If anything you can go see a therapist if it doesn't get better and as long as you're not against medications maybe they can give you something to get you out of the funk. Good luck
It's normal
It sounds like you may be depressed. I am a 27 (almost 28) year old male and I have been diagnosed with severe and recurring major depressive disorder. It comes and goes ever since I was 15. My family is part of it and the rest is genetics. I have had very good years and some bad ones. I have some questions for you and then I have some advice for you, if you are willing to chat.
well, sonny- as you're young enough to be my son- to begin with... additional questions are to be asked in real life... I should say that both your closest family and your Family Doctor there have to immediately get aware of what you're going through... until proven otherwise-it might be about depression...a common, treatable medical condition... and it's NO ONE'S fault... yet it has to be a real- life, thoroughly responsible, professional medical decision what exactly is it about...
Try to get fresh air by going for a walk. Being inside can lead to depression because you aren't doing anything. Please go outside,and I'm sure that will help you out. Good luck! :)
Sorry you feel that way. Try and engage in activities that you like coupled with regular exercise. You could also read biblical stories of Noah, Joseph, Abraham who were all happy at the end of there ordeal. It could make a difference. If that does not work, you might want to talk to a medical doctor.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Take some Gravol and it will put you to sleep while making you feel less nauseous. But if you're getting sick every night, you really should see a doctor and get to the bottom of it.
Try a tea made with ginger before you go to sleep.
A mug of hot water with two tsps of sugar in it. You can also try some gingerale or chamomile tea.
Ask your doctor if there is a medicine that that can help. In the mean time, try placing a heating pad on your belly.
Yep honestly I wouldn't date a girl that was 5'8" mainly because I wouldn't date a girl at all.
Nooooooo way. Sounds like a beautiful girl.

Fat is an insulator so excess fat is like wearing a jacket. More fat, heavier jacket. Heavy people are frequently over heated when skinny people are comfortable or a little cool. It is actually completely logical that fat people would sweat more.
Some of the time because they have more meat on them but it really just depend on your body.
Yes. More mass - greater energy needed to move - so they get hotter.
sure, because they are carrying around all that extra blubber.
yeah
You're burning more calories.
it's normal and try eating fruits and vegetables
do you want to be happy
I recommend the following: 1. if it's too hot, open a window 2. don't drink caffeine late in the day, it will keep you awake 3. buy a bottle of melatonin(melatonin is a naturally occurring chemical that you body makes to make you feel sleepy when it's nighttime) It might help you sleep better when you have insomnia.
I have had severe insomnia for over 23 years. I thank g-d for benedryl, zolpidem and clonazepam. Without all of them, I will not sleep at all. My is caused by work in climates where day is night and night is day for long periods and coming home just confuses the senses even more!
Read a boring religious book. In Australia genuine Melatonin is only available on prescription.
You should keep a bottle of melatonin to take on nights like that.
Periodically I have said...I simply get out of bed and do something....sometimes it allows me to then sleep...That's all really. I guess you are the other end of the globe... Atheist.

Believe it or not, someone actually did a study on this. Regular masturbation (at least once every other day) DOES decrease sperm count. HOWEVER! The decrease is not that large, and the sperm are not affected. So your swimmers will be just as good. The authors suggest that masturbation should have no effect on a man's fertility.
Not really, you never run out of sperm. Constantly produced. The sperm you ejaculate today would die in a few days. The sperm you ejaculate to father a child in 10 years was produced and developed just about 60 days before it will be ejaculated. Also masturbation is simply solo sex, nothing different that would reduce sperm count. Sperm are invisible without a microscope by the way so you can't see them.
Your sperm count will be lower if you ejaculate several times a day, but not permanently.
i never was concerned with sperm count
yes
No, of course not. NOT doing it will however. < M
very little
No, it is no different than sexual intercourse.
If I itch after I shower/bathe then usually that's my body telling me to moisturize. That's what I usually always do when I get out so if you want to long and let your body dry up it will get irritated.
Moldy shower stall or the tub needs scrubbing? Could be a fungus. Its possible to get 'athlete's foot' elsewhere on your body. Tolnaftate (Desinex) helps, so does Caldesene powder.
It could also be a cause of dry skin. try moisturizing after each bath with hypoallergenic lotion. Always moisturize after each bath
Do you use any oils/soaps/other bath products? You could be slightly allergic to atleast one of them. Read the ingredients, try only one at a time to nail it down.
that happened to me when i was younger , do you use a bar of soap?, cos that will definitely encourage itching if you have sensitive skin, use a moisturizing body wash.
Maybe because of the soap or body scrub you are using. Maybe your skin don't like them.
Didn't wash off all the soap or whatever. That or skin dryness.
you should change your soaps and shampoos. or your skin may be dry you need to moisturize it
maybe your allergic to something
you are not alone, I am 20 years old and have been suffering from anxiety/depression for 7 years. It's a daily struggle to feel powerless and anxious, but nothing will change by committing suicide. You've already hit low point, so it would only get better from here, life is filled with new possibilities. People have given some really good advices here, tried to make small steps and get 20 min exercises each day then gradually break out of the routines.. email me if you need someone to talk shala857@yahoo.com
I have had depression for around 3 years and anxiety for 2. I'm only just starting therapy. I'm optimistic. Try speaking to people with these problems. Maybe people in a support group. If you found somebody who is empathetic because of their own experiences, then this might help. I'm guessing that you, like myself, have not being in a serious relationship? This would change everything. It would help you grow up, grow as a person. Try dating somebody who has the issues aswel. It would help both parties.
he experts on self-help - including the authors who have written the best self-help books - say that this is no substitute for regular treatment with office visits. Maybe you could get better results next time with a therapist. At the same time, self-help has some advantages. While it's unlikely that you 're going to find the world's best therapist, you can buy - often for practically nothing if you buy a used copy from Amazon - the world's best self-help books.

You could find a magnifier glass and that would help greatly if you want to remove it yourself. Usually they do come out by themselves in time. Just cover it with something so you don't touch or bump it. If there is signs of redness, swelling and pus coming from it, then see a doctor.
It will fester out in time.
use a magnifying glass to see it and then remove it

They are a mental health charity in the UK, google them. Yes they can help a good deal. They have one to ones and a support group. You will meet other people who have the same problems as you. Well worth a try. Good luck. UK
For many people, it becomes involuntary. Lots of doctors are educated idiots when it comes to knowing the side-effects. If a court orders treatment, there's a good chance of getting an arrogant doctor, who cares little if your hair falls out, you have diarrhea, or you gain 40 pounds. It is the greater good, especially for the drug company. I would suggest some research of lamotrigine. It is generic Lamictal. Less side-effects than most medications. Avoid medications known to cause weight gain. http://www.m.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/medications-bipolar-disorder http://www.top10homeremedies.com/home-remedies/home-remedies-for-bipolar-disorder.html http://www.helpguide.org/articles/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-treatment.htm

It's evolution, NOT sin. Humans evolved for women to bare the child until the baby is born, and nurse them to ensure they're strong enough to survive on their own. Evolution, baby.
"I really want to be a better troll." 4 answers · Polls & Surveys · 7 days ago shame you didnt manage it

You are a fine troll.

Wtf. That's how children are made. Fûckng troll.
So I m 13 years old, and my class is going on a water trip soon but my period is due then and I don t want to waste my mom money and miss an experience so I asked If I could wear tampons on those days (I don t wear tampons normally) She said no and that was it... what should I do? should I just sit and watch everyone having fun on the trip? should I buy some and use it on the trip? Help!
Buy some anyway and use them on the trip. You don't mention the reason your mom objects to you using tampons. She may be under the false impression that it breaks your virginity, but that's an old wives tale and not true at all. The less she knows the better. This can be a private thing just for you.
Just go to the supermarket or drug store and buy yourself a box of tampons and don't tell your mother anything about it. If you don't know how to insert a tampon or how to use them, instructions come inside the box of tampons. Read the instructions.
BUY SOME! It will be worth it and tampons aren't that bad everyone wears them she won't know or notice
You should be able to wear a tampon. If your period comes, it comes. It shouldn't stop you from doing what you want to do. Just make sure you change it and know how to insert it right.
Borrow a friends! I mean what does she expect you to do, bleed all over everything. It would be wasting her money if you just sit out. Ask a friend or look around the house for some. They may have some at the hotel your staying at.
your mom shouldn't be preventing you from wearing tampons unless it has to do with your health. just go to the drugstore and buy some, they're pretty cheap and it's definitely worth having fun with your classmates.
I honestly think you should buy some yourself, because it's for you to decide what to use. But maybe talk to her first, and explain why you want to use them, if you haven't already.
Borrow a friends and don't tell her.
There is no reason you cannot use tampons.
Some men have large testicles, others have very small testicles. Most guys are somewhere between. The size of your testicles has nothing to do with your ability to produce testosterone or sperm. I too also had small testicles growing up and still did through adulthood. My nickname in high school with small balls . You'll be fine bro.
"The average testicle size after puberty measures up to around 2 inches long, 0.8 inches in breadth, and 1.2 inches in height (5 x 2 x 3 cm)." en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testicle
Probably grown as much as they will, testicle size varies among guys. did not say if you have a normal sexual drive, and regularly ejaculate- but if you do then probably are fine.
They do not usually grow much after 17. < M
Pop those testicles and check how it's gonna be after
Not everyone has large hangers.
Turn that fat into muscle - exercise. Don't try to lose the weight, just transform it. Keep that healthy for intake. Plus y'know, it releases endorphins and stuff, feel better anyway.
You will feel better if you start eating, at least 1800 to 2000 calories a day.
Exercise and drink lots of water
You are too thin for a person 5'4". You are anorexic.
You hit puberty ABOUT 2 years ago. You are IN growth spurt now. You are doing O.K. for 13. Stop worrying and just let puberty do its stuff. You will get pimples and acne and hairs all over your body in due course. < M
No one can tell. You just gotta wait and see. Some guys hit their marks early, whilst others take longer. One dude I knew your age, was the same height as yourself (and I thought he'd always be short) and less than two years later, he was touching 6' tall. It's all down to genetics.
Right now you are only getting a little extra testosterone. Just look at guys in high school. They are getting a lot of testosterone. You will hit that phase at some point.
You'll stop round 16. Like other men.
How do you know it's incorrect? I'm sure mistakes were and are made but more often the records are probably correct. Biracial relationships are nothing new. Unless it is a recent ancestor and there is photographic evidence to the contrary Occam's Razor suggests mixed ancestry.
The race on those census forms was put in by the census-taker rather than the individual being recorded, so you sometimes find different races given for the same individual from one census to the next.
Not among white people and black people. Mixed race people get counted as mulatto most of the time, but as white or black sometimes. Hispanics, especially if they have a little black in them, would cause the enumerator fits. I have 20,000 individuals, all told, in a dozen databases, almost all of them white. I've found families marked black less than a dozen times.

Pepto Bismal
You all have non-specific complaints that might have a single cause. And you want strangers to diagnose this. What's wrong with this picture?
id probably say paracetamol or ibuprofen are really good. plus there cheap in the chemist. these are the tablets n the UK I don't know where your from they may have these products. hope you and your family get better!
diarrhea is just pooping suck it up am i right. A tummy ache, just take a swig of some whisky, and you can stay in bed. Now daddy is the one who needs some medicine
Hmmm. I see your issue... Just go buy nyquil
Pepto Bismol will take care of all of you. (love the pink stuff :-)
Hearts burn is more important
I am concerned about a heart attack, as I have been dieting for about 2 months ( 1,000 calories a day ) and I heard the heart can get damaged with these kinds of diets. My symptoms started with an unsettling feeling... then I got chest pains. I still have the pressure feeling in my chest, and it almost feels like heart burn. Is this a heart attack, a panic attack, or nothing? I am a 15 year old female.
I doubt if that is a heart attack, it sounds more like stress / anxiety talk to a friendly responsible adult if you are still worried
So I'm a 15 year old guy who has been working out for over a year and I weigh only 130 max. I have gained like 30-35 pounds from the last year, when I weighed 100 or under. I am about 5 foot 7 btw. To be fair, I have a very low body fat percentage, and I think I look pretty muscular, because a lot of my friends and family say I'm looking pretty good. I am also a late bloomer, so I don't think I'm at a point where I will be putting on a lot of mass yet... but I don't know. Is this normal? And if not, what can I do to put on weight fast.
There is only so much you can do about your body. Your genetics have said that you will be a thin fit guy. I'm just like you. I was way too thin, no matter how much I worked out. When I hit 22 I was able to start to put on some poundage, and by 23 I reached 200. It was a pain in the *** of eating tons and tons of protein and working out 2 times a day, no running. Just do you, work on keeping your abs at 100, and you'll be fine buddy.
I'm 5' 10" and 120 lbs. You are definitely not skinny.
I'm actually the same age, and also about the same height and weight 0_o So yeah, i'm kind've a hypocrite when I say this because i'm skinny myself, but what i've been told is to just eat a lot of protein and work out.
It's normal, Not to woory,
Holy hell I hope you're joking. You are 21 years old, that technically makes you an adult and yet I am picturing you stamping your foot on the ground with a down turned bottom lip having a tantrum. You want big breasts? Go and have surgery, that way your boyfriend can cop a feel of lovely big fake silicon breasts. Good luck with all future endeavours.
Should be pretty easy: 1,800 mg 50% saponin shatavari extract 320 mg saw palmetto extract Should take 2-3 months to get DD/Es. So that's about 4 bottles of the first and 1 bottle second, $85. Order it online somewhere. If you want bigger than E then e-mail me naturalmedley at yahoo.com Also relax, all sizes are nice.
Look at others really! My breast were AA's. Usually it is only ones in the movies that get so big. Why not add extra pads on, in the bras, IF so obsessed to be so? The Bigger they are, the less ands less you can walk around without a bra on, before they fall down permittly by the weight!
36 C is a great size. The only way you can make them bigger is to visit a plastic surgeon, although your boyfriend may be disappointed when you get them. There is no magic beans to make them grow.
By massaging your boobs it will promote breast growth. Massaging your boobs will make your blood flow through them it will pick up the receptors which will make your boobs larger.
1. No on the face of it. 2. Yes. "I mean, is it possible for cancer cells to transfer from the cancerous lesions to the cut on the finger of the healthy person?"
Nope. Cancer is when one of YOUR cells goes bad & then spreads. Somebody else's cell would be immediately attacked by your immune system.
Cancer isn't contagious.
That would only work if you were a transplant patient on anti-rejection drugs
No and that's a stupid question...
No
Yes. They can go number 2 via their nipples too aswel
It is not true. The nipples are NOT connected to the bladder.

Im a 14 year old boy and my armpit hair is now dense (more so than my dad) lol. So I went to the doctor today and he s like ok take off your shirt and lift your arms up and then he started like rubbing them to check something. And then he' just went back to the normal business. It felt weird. like this is the first time anyone has even seen my hairy pits, nonetheless touched them. Not even my parents have seen yet. Why do I feel so weird lol? And why did he even need to check lol?
There are lymph glands under your armpits (swollen glands are a symptom of illness), so doctors have to feel them. They are under your jawbone, in your armpits, in your inner-hipbone area. normal.. Don't be embarrassed about armpit hair! You're a MAN. rock your manliness.
He was doing a normal exam, and you have lymph nodes in you arm pits. So he was checking them to see if they were enlarged. Nothing wrong with hairy pits, most guys have hair in their pits and yours differ from your dad's because you only got half your genes from him- other half came from your mother.
*shrug* who knows? such is life. At some point you'll find someone who likes 'forest'. Btw, embarrassment is just worrying about what other people think of you.
maybe parasites, who konw, ask him... (it depends on why you where there, there are skeen problms that hair could hide, so you have to rub in to check)
It used to be that bifocals were something that you never got until you around 45 or 50 years old. But that has changed and it is much more common than you might think. Many are getting bifocals before they reach 20 years old now. In large part the eyes are being exposed to so many devices with very small print that it only makes sense that the eyes are sure to be effected. Now with no line bifocals you probably would be surprised how many people you even know close to your age that wear bifocals.
Bifocals are usually used by aged. Its can be common in US.
Im 22 and have a different perscription for each eye. Its okay to be different. Im sure its common somewhere. Either way i wouldnt worry about it. As an adult it isnt a big deal. Everyone is unique in there own way.
It happens. We are all different. I discovered I needed glasses for farsightedness at age 20.
I'm a 15 year old girl who works part time, I go to school but I don't do any after school sports, I really want to but I feel like I'm to old to start something. I don't excerise cause I don't have any motivation, I'm tall and skinny but feel like I'm getting fatter and even my mum notices it a bit, I want to excerise in my house but my room is way to small and I have no where else to do it? what should I do cause I need to start getting fitter cause I feel so lazy lately and I hate it so much
For me being Vegan is the right way to a healthier life. I'm Vegan and I lift weights and I have never been happier. My motivation? I love life and I want to love more, doesn't get more simple than that. And as far as exercising, I was having second thoughts on going to the gym for a year until I decided to just do it, and its been the best thing that happened to me. Good luck with everything I'm sure you will do great.
You're not too old to start,it's never too late! However, I know how you feel my room is very small as well and I hardly have any space to even walk.My solution to that, is exercising in bed.You can do crunches, sit up,planks etc.I would also recommend eating on a smaller plate, it will look like you're eating more while you're actually eating less, eat smaller portions but more often to increase your metabolism speed,also cut your junk food intake, not completely though, you still need to treat yourself sometimes.And since you said you're tall and skinny,a bit of fat shouldn't hurt,as long as you feel healthy and happy. Hope I helped :) -Maria
Discipline is better than motivation. Do push ups, sit ups and Sprint. Sprint so that you are in shape, but aren't super thin. Nutrition instead of diet. Exercise instead of working out. Nutrition means that you get the right foods eaten, but aren't starving yourself like you would on a diet. Exercise because it's good for your body. Working out sounds painful, like you'll wake up sore and hate the experience. Exercise builds the body.
Meditation will help a lot! It will get you in a state of "being" and you will feel more motivated to improve the life that you're wanting to have. Figure out your self worth and why you are doing what you're doing with your life. Set a long term goal for yourself.
Be with me is the healthier way and you should,'t motivated.
Its never too late! If youre looking to eat healthier, you should start looking at healthy recipes. There is this low carb pizza recipe that can help you eat healthier, but also allow you to eat a good amount of food. It helps me lose weight! https://youtu.be/--LihEbwglY
You aren't too old for anything. You are 15. You have like 65 years ahead of you.;
Hi, Okay, so I have very severe itching/a rash around my vagina and it sometimes hurts so much it throbs. The area is very red and stings and I do have the main yeast infection symptoms. However, I m currently sitting my GCSEs so I cannot go to the doctor! I have an exam every day next week, so I can t leave school to see a doctor and I have no idea how I ll even manage to sit them since the burning is so bad. Any advice would really be appreciated, I m kind of freaking out.
Just walk into a pharmacy and ask for a yeast infection tablet, it's a single dose pill, I would say price wise ask for their own brand as it's fairly cheap and works the same. Relief behind within a day, in the mean time generally bathe it with a cold flannel on the outside. You don't require a doctor's prescription or anything so it's simple. Good luck with exams.
Most women have a vaginal yeast infection at some time. Candida albicans is a common type of fungus. It is often found in small amounts in the vagina, mou
yeast infection are easily cured with over the counter antifungals bought at any drug store or grocery store. no prescription or doctor appointment is required
Possible but rare. 1 in 1.3 million. What you are describing sounds nothing like breast cancer. If grandmother was the only one with breast cancer it is not considered an increased risk.
Young women can get breast cancer, but I will reassure you that it is very rare. Under 7% of all breast cancer cases are women under age 40. My guess would be that the pain is down to growth and/or hormones at this specific stage in your menstrual cycle. The itchiness could be down to dryness from showing in water that's too hot, or even a sign of allergy to a cleansing product. Make sure you regularly check for lumps, and see your doctor if you are that worried. But please let me stress that the chance of it being anything bad at your age is extremely low!
Extremely unlikely
I would take it easy while calling in for a check up. Just to be on the good side. Sorry about your grandma. Good luck :)
since you did not give a pic, go to your Dr
First, stop picking, and tell your mother.
Why would you want to live longer on a restrictive diet? If eating a cat turd everyday made you live longer - would you - same thing really.
Didn't serve old Adolph very well did it?
Yes I believe it does .
if it's well-balanced, yes
We are not optometrists or ophthalmologists, and we don't even know you. How could we say whether you need glasses? Get tested, yes, that's the obvious thing to do. However, it's also possible that your headache is caused by something else. You might want to see a doctor, too. At the very least, get yourself to one quickly if your exam says you don't need glasses, or if you get glasses and the headache persists. You shouldn't let a headache go on that long without getting medical attention.
I would get checked forgot anyways, it can't hurt and if you do have poor vision and don't want glasses you can get contacts. I had a lot of headaches before I got my eyes checked, I thought my vision was good too but then I got contacts and realized I was blind as a bat before and the headaches went away. It wouldn't hurt to follow your parents advice
I am not an optometrist but if this is when it's hard for to see you most likely have a vision issue glasses can correct
Quite possibly, but that's for an optician to say. A common cause of headaches is sitting at the computer with your shoulders hunched and your head back because that's where the screen is clearest. Check whether you need an extra pair just for the computer. You can hide them when the web camera is on.
I had eyestrain and headaches before i wore glasses. Get a proper eye exam.
We don't know how well do you see, and how well did you see before, but I think that if you think your vision is blurrier, go see a doc. But I don't think glasses can solve headache.
No harm in going in for an exam. You may think you see fine but that may be because you have nothing to compare it to with correction.
You should go. I never thought I needed glasses until I put them on and it was like..."woah! EVERYTHING is in high definition"
your parent's are right and you need to get tested
You need to get checked. Could be nearsightedness
Oatmeal has TONS of carbs?! News to me, but that could be a matter of opinion. There are fewer carbs in a cup of oatmeal then 2 slices of bread, but much more filling. However, you need to have plain oatmeal, not the kind with tons of added sugar. The salads/soups can also contain lots of calories, depending on their ingredients. Before you eat them, you need to compare ingredients. Leave out the fatty ingredients, except for nuts. You will need the protein and they fill you up quick.
Oatmeal has TONS of carbs. Salad and soups also contain carbs depending on their ingredients. Before you start some nonsense diet plan, you need to learn about food first, because there's a lot you don't know.
very little unless you exercise..........the ONLY way to loose w8 and keep it off is to exercise off more calories than you eat

I'm pretty sure there's actually a spray you can use (you have to spray it on every day though) that tightens the muscles. Another option would be to get labiplasty, but that's only if it matters that much to you and if you can afford it. The surgery lasts about 2 hours and takes 4-6 weeks to fully heal post-surgery. Or you could just not care!
Kegel exercises might help. They tell women to do them after giving birth and in general to strengthen the vaginal muscles. Your vagina will never be the same as it was before you were sexually active, that's just a fact. However, these exercises might help, give them a shot. Search them up on google. You can do them while sitting down, lying down, standing...it's pretty discreet.
5 minutes with me and you will think it's tight .... I got 13 inches
There is an exercise you can do for that, but I forget what it is called to tighten the muscles. Ask your gynecologist.
Only masturbate with small dildos and over time it will shrink to accommodate it.
Put in the dryer and maybe it will shrink.
Stop having sex for a while.
Stop being a Prostitute.
have the doctor stitch it up a few stitches.
The dentist will numb your mouth by that area so that you don't feel the pain. You still will feel some of the pain but it's really not that bad. You do have to keep the filling forever and you don't even feel it. Cavities happen, just brush your teeth everyday and that should prevent them from happening.
First you get a numbing. Not going to tell you how you recieve it because if you just close your eyes before looking at what he uses to numb you it wont hurt. Atleast that's what happened to me. Then you wait a bit for the numbing to take effect then they just fill it in, you will barely feel a thing.
Usually the only painful part of the procedure is when they inject you with an anesthetic(usually lidocaine) to numb you up. In layman's terms they use a filler to fill the hole in your tooth. Ideally you want the filler to stay in forever but sometimes they do fall out.
I panic about my health a lot. I'll have panic attacks because I think I'm sick but I'm not. I've had health problems, I think that's why. I'm a bit traumatized for whatever reason.
No. And I have had cancer. You take one day at a time. If it happens it happens Worrying about it won't stop it from happening. Why not ask yourself one question. "What happens if I live to be 100 years old with nothing more than a cold or flu? Where would all this senseless worrying get me?" Absolutely Nowhere.
Stop consulting Dr. Google. Ask a REAL doctor so they can explain what may be wrong rather than read about worst-case scenarios.
What you describe is OCD. A therapist will help you with that so that you stop panicking.
My bestfriend only eats one meal a day. It's not that she doesn't want to eat it's that she's never hungry. She normally only has tea but when she does it makes her feel quite nauseous. She's also tired a lot (fatigue.) I'm pretty certain this has been going on for a few weeks now and I'm worried.
"Is one meal a day okay?" No one meal a day is NOT ok. Eating one meal a day, could easily be symptomatic of anorexia, especially with the fatigue factor. If your friend is a teenager, and is under the legal age of majority, then this matter needs brought to the attention of her family, and as quickly as is possible.
If she is starting to display evidence of fatigue and nausea it's quite possible she is not eating enough. Three meals a day is the most widely suggested amount. Of course I'm not familiar with her financial situation ( if it is a factor at all).
well i grew up that way only eating one meal a day and i am now 50 years old and still do the same thing
If your friend is a minor child, tell her parents what is going on. She is tired because she is not eating enough. She is in danger of doing irreparable damage to her internal organs. If she cannot eat, she needs medical attention.
wow, you really have a lot of struggles. First, for your weight, you can lose 10 lbs/mo. with this plan: Stick to fresh fruits and veggies, salads, fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, fruit/yogurt smoothies and lots of water. Avoid fast food, junk food, sweets, greasy foods, sodas, coffee, starches and carbs. For anxiety/depression or whatever, tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. It will definitely improve and level our your moods. You will soon be healthy and happy. To sleep better, soak in a nice hot bath, and take Melatonin (otc); it's a great sleep aid.
Your symptoms describe borderline personality disorder which occurs as a result of childhood trauma. Psychologists won't disclose a diagnosis of BPD until you're over the age of 18 and emotionally ready to accept the diagnosis. Learn about the symptoms at http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/borderline-personality-disorder-bpd/#.VzaEyPkrLIU
You need to talk to your psychologist about all this. It is quite clear that your current treatment plan is not working. You may need a dosage adjustment on your medications or different medication or both.
weight is only a small part of flying. Balance and skill are also key factors, but no, 110 is not too heavy.
Pretty much ideal weight.
No, you're not heavy.
No you re perfect.
In weight lifting or exercise it's a "repetition" or one complete movement. Taking a step would be a "rep. Walking a distance would be a "set". Another example. When bench pressing. Starting with your arms extended, lower the weight to your chest and then push it back up = 1 rep. Doing that 10 times (10 reps) = a set. Good question.
Rep = repeat. Doing something twice is 2 reps. Doing it 12 times is 12 reps. Each 'rep' is a set, so if you're going to do 4 sets, you're going to do that movement a grand total of 60 times a day spread out over four separate times.
repetitions
repetitions...
Dunno
Yes
Many parents miss the signs. They think of their kids as "quirky" or "introverted". There are other psychological conditions that can cause symptoms similar to autism. If the specialist just says "not autism," a psychiatrist can properly diagnose you. A therapist can help you deal with whatever the issues are that caused you to seek the specialist, regardless of what is causing them.
I noticed in my brother than it became more noticable because the expectations of him increased- it's normal for kids to not have a perfect grasp on social interaction and to have a temper tantrum every now and then, but when an adult does that it stands out a lot more

Ok
You might have retrograde ejaculation where the semen is going into your bladder. I would see a urologist
Well if you hardly masturbate that might be the reason. Do you NEED to see a doctor = well no, you aren't going to die. What would be the point if you don't use it. < M
Hello, some men have this and its probably something in your body. Nothing bad just things that you need to eat like salmon, fish, vegetables. That would increase your sperm.
my grandpa cu mms and dust comes out
So nothing is working to clear up my acne, and so I'm changing my whole diet because it's really my last option here. I bought a lot of fruits and veggies and other healthy stuff, and bought a 6 pack of eternal water (which is 50 fl ounces per bottle), and I plan on drinking one of those bottles a day. Will this help my acne? After I bought all of this I looked it up and people say diet has nothing to do with it. Any personal experience? And do you think that's enough water or should I drink more? My diet has been really awful, so please let me know if that was the whole problem.
Diet has a lot to do with acne.What you put in your body shows through your skin. If you eat a lot of unhealthy foods like junk food obviously you won't have beautiful glowing skin.Yes, some people have it like that because of genetics, but I say you start eating healthy because it has a huge impact on your skin.I know a lot of people who became vegan and their acne cleared up which is amazing. As for the water, i drink 2l of water a day, that's what is recommended. So yes you should start eating healthy food and i'm sure you'll see a change!It will only do you good, so don't worry. Good luck!!
it's more about hormones, not really the food you eat. but hey, at least all of the stuff you bought will make you healthier
My mother is morbidly obese we are talking really HUGE! She makes fun of everyone who is even slightly overweight. She even calls her grandson "fat boy". It is a way to deflect their own problem. All you can do is act like you didn't hear it. It's tough but if they don't get a reaction from you then they wont be getting what they want and will stop.
Rise above it, clearly he's just jealous and picking on your insecurities as he secretly has his own and wants to make himself feel better. You're beautiful! :)
Possibly see a psychiatrist. He is verbally abusing you which obviously isn't good
Work on losing weight. You cannot control what he says just ignore best you can.
NO do not resort to subway if you want to loose belly fat. The best options are working out for atleast 2 hrs a day and eating fruits and vegetables.
I can't say enough good things about Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . This is the 3rd time I'm ordering it now, because I find it to be very effective, plus it tastes great as well. I wish that there were more packets in an order, but for the price, It's worth it. Goes down smooth as well which is the best part. I'm very pleased!
Fat is fat. Eat fewer calories and you will lose weight. Where you lose it first is dependent on your particular genetics. You cannot lose fat in just one part of your body. In fact, you can't lose fat at all. You can only shrink the fat cells that are already there.
Eat salads and fruit! Eggs are good for breakfast and try and get low calorie snack!
Boxers are like shorts looks cute and lot of air. Brief is sexy and holds scrotum. Boxer brief however isn't sexy or cute. It's just tight cloth for sports or something. Seems like boxer briefs are popular since it isn't dorky shy boxer or gay brief. So the so called homophobic scared striahgt people wear these to prove they are not gay or something ?
I've always just worn briefs. I never once tried boxers or boxer briefs because they look uncomfortable and have way to much fabric. I've always just though underwear should be supportive and have no fabric going down your legs.
I find it more comfortable not wearing underwear and letting my genitals hang loose.
There really isn't anything you need to do to prepare. If you have a low pain tolerance, you might want to take a Tylenol before your appointment but it shouldn't be necessary. There may be some pressure on your teeth as the braces are removed, but it should not hurt. Once you get the retainers, wear them exactly as the orthodontist instructs. They should also tell you how to clean your retainers. If they don't give you instructions, be sure and ask. Enjoy your new smile!
You don't really need to do anything to prepare to get your braces off. It will feel strange, and you may feel some pressure, but it should NOT hurt. If if hurts, then the person who is removing them is doing something wrong. Be sure you wear your retainer/s exactly as your orthodontist tells you to. You don't what the time and money spent on braces to be wasted.
To be honest it does hurt quite a bit. There isn't much you can do to prepare but brush your teeth really well right before you will get them off. After you get them off you should do a whitening treatment (I recommend it), whether it is an at home kit or a professional thing that you can get done at the dentist. Good for you that you get them off! Good luck!
just go, and when you walk out of the building, look in the mirror, smile, and you'll see the fantastic improvement the braces did to your teeth. im getting braces soon, really excited.
I'm 15 and male, throughout the day I usually consume this amount of food, 2 slices of peanut butter toast, 2 eggs, 8 servings of fruits and vegetables, 6 chicken nuggets, mini chex mix bag, one bar of soft baked oatmeal squares, and one plate of chicken breast cut into small pieces. I want to lose weight. I'm not what people would imagine as a fat kid, I'm also not in shape since I have a gut. My biggest problem is man boobs. I'm gonna be working out but how much food should I cut.
Eating healthy food all the time is not going to make you lose weight. It's the food quantity. I mean, it's very good that you're eating fruits and vegetables.. but you're eating too much of it. "Between meals, if you are hungry enough to eat an apple, eat an apple. If you are not hungry enough to eat an apple, you aren't hungry." -Reddit
reduce the carbs n sugars a bit, but dude read this [[ http://www.naturalnews.com/041646_chicke... ]] eh?
Not really, it's best to change your tampon when you're supposed to. Tampons should be changed at least every 4-6 hours - some tampon companies say up to 8 hours to make their products seem more convenient but it's not healthy or hygienic, certainly it's a really bad idea to leave tampons this long on a regular basis or if you're at increased risk of TSS. The longer you leave tampons the longer you give bacteria to multiply without allowing vaginal cleaning and if you can go that long without leaking it's too high an absorbency. You'd likely be fine but you would be at higher risk of TSS and vaginal infections like Bacterial Vaginosis.
I wouldnt do that, maybe get a compact tampon, unwrap it before the school day, hide it in your pocket and put it in the bathroom stall. No noise. Works every time.
yes
As a seasoned nurse, please take one tampax to school and change at your lunch time.
Nowadays, migraine has become one of the most common forms of chronic pain. When it strikes, the sufferer feels unbearable pain along with nausea, and at times vomiting. In addition, the intense and sharp pain not only stays constant at the temples, but also radiates throughout the entire head. If you hate to rely on the counter medications for everything, luckily there are handful of home remedies to treat migraine. Instead of succumbing to the incredible pain of migraines, you can try below remedies to get the right relief. • Drink Grape Juice • Eat Nuts • Take Lemon Juice • Massage • Meditation
Excedrin Migraine. Has caffeine in it that gets rid of the migraine pretty fast. Drink some water and lay down where it quiet and dark afterwards.
I wouldn't try the Excedrin Migraine. Sometimes caffeine can be the cause of a migraine. I would try an NSAID like Aleve. And peppermint oil helps my migraines, too. I rub one drop on each temple and across my forehead (avoid the eyes!) and two drops on my neck.
You don't. At least, most can't, even with migraine medication or painkillers. Migraine medication is mostly about PREVENTION of migraine. Each person is different when it comes to treating migraine as it's happening.
Put your palms over your eye lids so it's complete dark. Lay back and put a cold towel on your head. It always helps me
Drink lots of water.
have a pain killer and try to sleep of just lie down with all the lights off and in complete silence.
Sleeping naked is actually quite common, I personally know a lot of people of sleep naked. Many people argue that it's not good for you, though it's not proven that it can lead to any illnesses.
I think it's normal to sleep naked. Especially if it's with someone you love. I would love to sleep naked with a few people that I can think of right now. I wouldn't mind it one bit. Lol
Yes it's normal, it's more comfortable, that's why I sleep naked.
Completely normal
Normal. But I sleep with clothes on though lol
Absolutely normal
Could I sleep with you ? I sleep naked too.
it quite Normal. But I sleep with clothes
yeah, it's normal. . I've slept naked since I was a little kid because that's what men in my family do .I ain't shy at with my dad, but I don't want my mother to see my hairy dick' and because I've always slept naked, my mother knows to knock on my door before she comes into my room. She doesn't want to see me naked either since I started to get hairy.
The average time lived without water is about 3 days but some people can live up to 8-10 days without water. Food is also a variable in this, most contain liquids. You should probably drink something, its not good for you body to go without any liquids.
It can be important to get enough sodium when consuming water, especially if in isolation of foods, to prevent water intoxication.
You will die of old age. Recent studies have shown that we get sufficient water in the food we eat.
you can only survive 3 days without water, you should start drinking again
Not much longer, have a good trip!
3 days total,give or take.
Why would you wanna die? Drink water. You need it.
I'm sympathetic if that person has had a cold or something like that, but if that person is a smoker,it's different. That's just a weak, pathetic addict that doesn't appreciate their precious lungs. Those people will cough constantly, and then what do you know? You see them lighting up another cigarette, and another, and another...with blank denial that um, duh, the cough is clearly due to smoking. They cough over and over and over and over again! It's disgusting! It make my gut cringe to hear coughing like that. Does it annoy you too?
One day I was walking down the street and sitting on a bench was a man attached to an oxygen tank on wheels with a tube going into his nose. He obviously had emphysema and could not breathe properly without carrying his oxygen tank around. I felt sorry for him. Then on may way back I passed the same man. This time he was smoking a cigarette. I lost all compassion for him because he knew his condition and was actively making it worse.
No. What people do to themselves is their own business. If you hear someone coughing you just walk away if it annoys strong, pure and special people like you. Logic.
Yeah. I smoke; but my ex was two packs a day and started every morning by lighting up before she was even fully awake and then choking half to death for an hour or so. Just another thing that pissed me off about her.
Rain is not shown by society to be a good thing. Whenever rain is in a movie, it is a nuisance to the characters. It either ruins their plans, or is there when something negative is happening (a break up or fight). It is seen to be depressing scenary. As a child, the rain may have been weather that cancelled your plans or ruined your fun. Rain isn't nice to be in. It's cold, it gets your clothes wet, and can ruin how you look. Although, rain is important. Without rain, we wouldn't be living.
You are not alone. Many people become down when it rains due to lack of sunlight and such.
Some people are just happier on sunny days. Lack of sunshine can cause serious disease.... You actually get vitamin D from the sun. I love all days and all weather...
I love the rain. Its so peaceful
I don't mind especially when there is a storm that goes with it.
Chicago, aka Chicongo, Chiraq, etc. The Democrats put heavy regulations on business and poured welfare into the working class there as well as threw money at school systems with highly abusable cash incentives and now the entire city is a shithole since all of functioning society has moved elsewhere.
Chicago is a city in Illinois. Lots of liberals and bad black people there.
Its a blacksploitation film that pays an homage to the old West, but in place of charm, good triumphing over evil, and good manners, we have instead, anger, perversion triumphing over decency, and primitive behavior.
Chicongo is a racist name for Chicago, a city.
chicongo making fun of Chicago due to it's high concentration of ******* (Congo is a war torn country in Africa) non-****** #1: "Man, I got my bike stolen again last week!" non-****** #2: "You gotta lock up your bike; you are in Chicongo now!"
an idiot loon city located on the shores of Lake Michigan
yeah well, its a war zone in Americas midwest
Absolutely my friend.
Hey there, Some Christians do believe that and some don't. Sometimes Plan B can prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus wall. I personally believe a fertilized egg is a human being in its earliest stage so I believe that when Plan B does this, it is a form of abortion.
Heres how the Plan B pill works: -Temporarily stops the release of an egg from the ovary -Prevents fertilization -Prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus The Plan B pill doesn't work if the person is already pregnant! The pill PREVENTS pregnancy. In no way does it harm a baby for if the pill works that means there was no baby that ever existed in the first place.
Well, Christians believe all kinds of nonsense without knowing the facts. Plan B prevents pregnancy from occurring, it does not abort established fetuses. The fact that anyone thinks preventing pregnancy is abortion or murdering babies is simply astounding - and we let these people drive cars and operate machinery.
"Plan B stops you from getting pregnant if the egg has not been fertilized. It does not terminate an existing pregnancy. Pro Lifers are morons, they care much more about the life, than the quality of life." That is false information. Plan B can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting, thereby killing it. To think that is any different than an abortion is intellectually dishonest. Look up Plan B on WebMD: "It is also possible that this type of emergency birth control prevents implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus by altering its lining."
Yes
Well, I'm a christian and I'm pro choice.
No. Why, did you expect scientific or medical accuracy out of these people?
"Is it true what this Christians say that Plan B is abortion & murder babies?" Of course not -- murder is a Felony Crime. Comparing that to a legal medical procedure is utter nonsense and just more right-wing dishonest hysteria. If their anti-abortion argument held ANY water, they wouldn't need to resort to lies, misrepresentations and histrionics to try and win people over. They, themselves, prove what a lame-azz position they're coming from when they lie like that.
No lol. Plan B is no more of an abortion than blowing your nose is. Your bloggers contain more human cells than a one or two day old embryo does. EDIT: Thumbs down? Don't know much about science do you? You people are a joke.
Be careful he doesn't resort to auto-cannibalism. After all, cats seem to love eating fish.
Nothing. he probably is a fish in a cats body
Possibly go back to school and educate yourself with English and grammar.
Try to grow a few brain cells, you might try it too.
Concentrate on growing up
Pray. According to me there is no other powerful solution for this problem.
I just posted a question yesterday about my left eye bothering me after getting contacts. Now there's another problem. I can see very well far away. But when I'm using my computer, everything on the monitor seems blurry, especially from my left eye. I have to lean back like 2 feet away just to be able to type this. If I'm close up, things start getting even blurrier to the point where I see nothing at all. Is this normal? And I don't know if this is important, but I am 15, and I'm a first time contact lens user.
It is harder to focus up close with contacts than the same prescription in glasses if you are myopic. At 15 we assume that you have the focusing ability to see at computer distance even with contacts. the problem may resolve over time. You may need to wear readers if you spend a lot of time on the computer. You may need to be refit in multifocal contact lenses.
Up until now you have no had to exercise your accommodation but with contacts you must. Contacts don't help as much as glasses for close up?
Sicne you are on a lower sodium diet, perhaps you are eating a little more potassium. If this is so, you will likely urinate more. More sodium causes you to hold onto water, whereas less will allow it to leave your body as it should. BUT, if you are concerned, call your doctor. This is the person who can answer your health questions with more reliability. Rather than eating in a severe manner try: More fresh fruits and vegetables. Less packaged foods and less refined flour products, and no soda pop. More pure orange juice. Try eating at least one apple per day. Two would be even better.
It depends on if you need a low sodium diet or not. If you are healthy, going too low is unhealthy. 2300 mg is the highest you should go, but the lowest is 1500. That is what is suggested for people who have high blood pressure or other conditions that require low sodium. Going lower can result in an electrolyte imbalance which can be deadily.
It could be nothing, but it might be helpful to get advice from a physician. Excessive urination associated with sodium is usually associated with diabetes, so it would be safer than not to get a second opinion. :)
As you should... low sodium allows your body to flush out more keeping your blood pressure down. You will not get dehydrated because your kidneys will compensate between blood potassium and salt.
Usually the person has to have a BMI of 40 or higher, making him or her morbidly obese, and have given serious attempts to other means of weight loss without success. Sometimes they'll consider someone with a lower BMI in the mid-30s if they have serious illnesses or conditions direction related to their obesity. Patients where I live are extensively screened and counseled to ensure they understand this is not a cure-all, that for the rest of their lives they will be restricting calories and quantities both. They don't want to do a gastric bypass on someone who is going to stretch out the remaining stomach and overeat again.
You would need to be considered morbidly obese
depends on what type of surgery it is
If i know , it doesnt matter, but if you are alot of overweight it can be risky. I
Move to Belgium. Mentally ill well people can be put down there.
why don;t you just get help for the depression? that's what therapy and mediation is for
Predicted Adult Height: 6 feet 5 inches. P.S it makes me sad that you are 12 and I'm 15 and you are taller. It predicts I'll be 5'5 when I grow up which I am now :/ #ShortLife
No one on here can possibly know how tall your going to be. Any attempt by a fool to do that is just throwing out a random number. We know nothing about your medical history, your genetics, your health status, your living environment, your diet and exercise routine, your sleep habits... Nothing
Crystal ball technology is not that good. You are tall for 12, but bone plates may close early because i guess you are well into puberty. < M
-You will end up Between 6'3 & 6'5. So I HOPE Your mother has a lot of Food in the House !! :)
There's a growing thought that asthma is hooked very much to diet. As the diet of the world is increasingly junk food, asthma is growing by leaps and bounds all over the world. One thing to try is to figure out what JUNK is and get it out of your diet. Otherwise you can poison yourself with prescription drugs.
I have looked this up before, and I have not seen any type of cure only treatments. There's several treatments that I have seen. (mostly natrual) I recommend doing your own research though.
No but there's treatment options
lying down, face up.
Most of the time lying down on my bed. Every now and then down sitting down when I use my *********. And obviously standing up when in the shower.
If late in the evening, lying in bed on my back, if during the day, usually sitting up or even standing. Just depends on my mood.
I usually lying down but slightly elevated head so that i could see pleasuring my own...
feet in the air above my head with my co ck aimed at my face
Position? It's not sex.
Lying on my bed naked.
Never too much for breakfast - unless you stuff yourself. Eating alot for breakfast is ideal - when its healthy as this when your body can process food at its best. And keeps the fuller for longer.
No breakfast should be the biggest of all the meals you eat everyday Dinner the smallest. Consume like 1/2 of your calories of breakfast and eat your carbs for lunch
Actually a bigger breakfast in the beginning of the day is better. But If you feel like your full just stop eating.
That's not too much. And the fact that you'd even ask, that's very strange.
People cut when they need to feel. I'm guessing your friend is depressed. Don't ask her why. There's never a straightforward answer. But do try and help her. If she brings something up about it, don't question her. Listen and be understanding. Depression is hard to get through on your own so always be there for her.
Kids mutilate themselves because they were horribly abused as little kids. It's no small deal - they need heavy professional care. Often they have have repressed the abuse and have no idea WHY they do this - it just makes them feel better for a short time.
Nothing can be done by humans when it is predestined. We cannot interfere with fate. You should pray and seek some divine guidance or intervention.
Because She is very unappreciative of the gift life.
By whom? An incomplete diagnosis is not a diagnosis. Follow up with your doctor. Or was it some random person who "thinks" you have cancer.
So, see a doctor for the necessary tests.
And the big word is MIGHT!!! When you know for sure you have it, then you can panic.
Sorry to hear that :(
Carry a barf bag with you, tell people you are prone to occasional up-chucking, and then just go wherever you want. The ones who accept you as you are will be potential friends. Your mom can see on the other side of youth and is willing to use tough love to get you on a better path in your young (and neurotic) life. There is a possibility you subconsciously created your own problem as an excuse to avoid responsibility, just as "You Wrong" has suggested. If barfing is all you are worried about doing, the barf bag is a solution, because once you do the barfing, you can then get busy living.
Go see a doctor and get treatment. Period. "Helping" you does NOT mean allowing you to sit on your a$$ and play video games all day. She is willing to help you if you help you.... otherwise GTFO.
I have always maintained healthy eating habits and try two exercise three times a week but I still have some weight that I just cannot lose. When I started with Weight Loss Green Store Tea product initially I felt let down but after the seventh day I started to see a gradual weight loss. I guess I was expecting a miracle and not letting Weight Loss Green Store Tea product get to work. I am now only a few pounds away from my target weight
Is your mom a mailman? My mom is like this. When she reached her 40s she said she felt "heavy" and she started training for a half marathon. She said that she sees one of her coworkers, who has 5 little kids, running at like 5 in the morning, and that if he can do it, she can do it too. It's been a few years since then and she actually ran her first marathon last year. I'd say if she can make the time to run, it is worth a shot.
don't drink cola drink only water eat dinner at least four hours before you go to bed
Well to start she should eat fruits, vegetables, anything to help her.
My friend told me a few days ago that shes anorexic. She's 5'6 and she is currently 89 lbs, she told me that her "goal" is to be 80 or 75. I'm really scared for her because she said she eats only one meal a day, and she overdoses on weight loss pills. She said that if i tell anyone, she'd hate me forever.
If you really care about her, you'll contact a trusted adult or her parent(s) that can find her the help she needs. She will probably get angry, but it's either that or she is going to die. Anorexia is a very serious mental problem that claims the lives of many teens and young adults. If she's also forcing herself to throw up, she is also bulimic. Throwing up so frequently can erode your teeth and destroy your esophagus from the stomach acids. Please get her help ASAP. This link will tell you what you should or need to know about both. https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/health-consequences-eating-disorders
You should tell a guidance counselor or something, I'm sure if you tell someone and then she gets the help she needs she'll be grateful instead
She sounds like a drag. Don't be scared. Anorectics are like cockroaches. They live forever.
She's disgusting. Tell her to stop and make her understand that's a horrible way to be.
wow, I read that this is treatable. is there a way you schedule a visit with a physician and bring her along
No. But it has a drastic effect on grammar.
no it won't
what a stupid question
LMAO... no. Why would you ask that?
Hired assassinators
1) Don't see how it is necessary or wise to publish your name. 2) Seems like your problem came about from lying. Never a good idea.
I am 19 years old (almost 20), am 5'7, and am a female. My waist (measured at my belly button) is 32 inches and my thighs (at thickest part) measure 23.5 inches. Please be honest. I can accept criticism if need be. Please feel free to let me know if I need to improve myself (especially if you thick my waist circumference needs to be reduced). Thank you for taking the time to read and/or answer this question. I will absolutely award a best answer.
You say you are 5'7, but your waist is 32 inches. That suggest you are, but you must have guessed that. So, are you expecting us to lie to you? If not the waist size, doesn't the 23.5" thighs give you a clue!?
You ask: "Would you say I am overweight?" You fail to say how much you weigh. No one can say since you failed to provide your weight.
tough to say, Im gonna have to ask you to sit on my face to get a better picture.
fat bottom girls you make this rockin' world go round
Yeah they can if the schools corrupted enough. It is. Most of the time it's capd or dyslexia. A lack of subvocalization and losing meaning. So kids like that, who improvise and it looks like being distracted are not chemically imbalanced. Adjusting chemicals in kids with hyperactivity can create dangerous conditions for their hearts. When they don't have an imbalance.
It may depend on the state or nation, but I think parents can force their children to receive "appropriate" medical care until the child is 18.
Everything here depends on the mental health of your parents.

You can chew gum if you want, but you are risking damaging the braces. It could make you have to wear the braces longer. It also can get stuck in the braces and become a mess.
I've had braces and I loved to chew gum! Keep on chewing and soon enough you will get used to it
I had braces i didnt chew gum at all when i had them.
They have gum specifically for people with braces, or you could just chew gum anyway and then clean really well afterwards lol...
you can don't worry
try putting it in a girl and it will come
You ejaculate, you don't "sperm". Semen is what comes out when you do, and sperm is only a tiny portion of your semen. But just keep up the stimulation and should happen.
Any time from the next few weeks, to months. There's no cut-and-dried answer for when it happens, as it's down to genetics, not wishful thinking. Be patient. Explore different techniques, and most of all, have fun.
Actually you already making sperm if you have pubic hair so ejaculation should happen any day now. Try again. < M
Lol, "sperming".
Hi guys! I've been having this lump in my anus fir a month now. I was too scared that it might be anal cancer. I even went for colonoscopy. The doctor said she didn't find anything unusual but i swear I can still feel that lump. Do you guys think I shouldn't worry with my doctor's diagnosis or is it possible my doc missed and did not see it? Please advise guys..
If they didn't find anything than it is safe to say that you are Fine and Dandy. Yes, you shouldn't worry at All. There is NO Way to miss a lump with a colonoscopy.
Do you bottom and not have your partner wear a condom? The biggest risk factor for you for anal cancer would be HPV, which you could get with unprotected anal sex if your partner had HPV (also maybe from rimming, but through would be a stretch). When you went to your doc, did you tell her about risky sexual activity. Of course, it could also be a wound from sexual activity. Finally, it could be that you are feeling a perfectly normal part of your anatomy and thinking it is something else. Talk to your doc.
it's more likely a hemorrhoid
it might be Haemorrhoids (piles) it should just go away but if not there should be a cream you can buy
This is a time you can trust your doctor.
He probably should have explained to you what he was going to do. He may have forgotten because health care workers deal with naked people all the time so they are used to it. I'm not sure what the laws are about this, but he was definitely inconsiderate. If you see him again, ask him to explain what he's going to do and not to touch you without your permission. You can tell him how he made you feel. Or you can ask about going to a different doctor.
Yes this was most likely necessary. See you have lymph nodes all over your body. They are most easily found in/around your neck area and on your lower stomach/crotch area (also insides of upper thigh). If you really wanted your parents to leave the room, all you would have had to do is ask. The doctor was most likely just trying to be thorough to keep you healthy and safe
He had a terrible bedside manner but i don't think you were taken advantage of. On the plus side, you will be able to have sympathy for your wife everytime she has to get a vaginal exam. Ugh.
It is a serious mental health problem, for which you have to take some or the other drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. Consult a professionally qualiied doctor forthwith.
You have to have other symptoms that makes him think anxiety.... if he is prescribing you psych meds based ONLY on shortness of breath (all the time or intermittent?) then he is incompetent and you need to see another doctor.
Are you over weight or a smoker? Could also be asthma
Naa, just don't drink Flint water
One woman died while competing to see who could drink the most water on a radio show.
Too much of fluids are bad
Women whose weight starts with a 1 are like men whose height starts with a 5. They shouldn't exist.
I'm 5 ft. 4 and weigh 107 and I think I'm too thin.
Yes you're anorexic. Start lifting weights and eating pasta meat yogurt veggies etc.
you sound skinny im a personal trainor xxx
your fine and be happy with your body
Im nearsighted too and what i did when i first got my glasses was that I only wore them when i really needed them like for instance in class and especially driving. But now i use contacts so i dont have to worry about when to have them on or when to take them off. As far as damaging your eyes.....ehh well considering that i occasionally switch from glasses to contact, i would say no. Your retinas are consistently self adjusting in the light and in the dark so damaging them should be in the least of your worries. Just dont poke at em lol.
All the time. If they help you see better, why would you not wear them? It is a commonly held myth that wearing glasses causes your eyes to get worse. This myth arises because for many people, their eyes get worse, they get glasses when they're young, their eyes continue to get worse, so they need stronger glasses. This is NOT because of the glasses, it's because the eyes are changing. If this weren't the case, then adults who wear glasses would see their eyes getting worse, but nearsightnedness tends to stabilize in the early 20s.
You should be taking off your glasses for prolonged close work. That is the only time it can make a difference. Your friend prefers to see the clearest possible all the time, so she wears them. Some people are bothered more than others by less than perfect vision.
Being near sighted means that you cannot see from long distances. So, to look at the board, she would need her glasses. Walking through the hallway, yes, she needs to wear her glasses too. I am near sighted or as we called it in the UK 'shortsighted'. Anyway, I bet she looks very smart in them. Have a nice day. :)
Broken bone, lack of blood going there, nerves
how far did you put it up your bum??
wtf
For the past feel days, I've been feeling so emotional. I'm so annoyed at everyone, I listen to my mom's footsteps and I feel myself getting upset. I hear my friend's sarcastic voice and I want to ***** slap her. I've been so mad that when I did "drawing to relieve stress" I drew through 10 pages. I don't know whats wrong with me help me please!!!
There is something wrong somewhere. You should gain some moral courage to explore them. You should know how to unfold such mysteries of life. If you still have genuine doubts, please consult a professionally qualified doctor forthwith.
It's normal, don't worry. Being emotional isn't a bad thing. Unless this is completely abnormal, there isn't anything to worry about.
These sound like normal adolescent mood swings. Hang on, they will go away.
Write. Keep writing until you figure it out. Write I feel And Because Do it over and over until you get at your feelings.
If you are female its PMS which will happen every month unless you take b.c. pills. Or go to fewerperiods.com
It's called irritability.... happens to everyone sometimes.
Girl, I am 18 and up until last year I wouldn't go out in ANYTHING remotely revealing because I felt the same way and let me just tell you, that was not the way to live. I missed out on so many things and I completely regret not loving myself enough to go out without worrying. I know this sounds cliche but love yourself how you are. Whether you decide to shave your stomach or not, do not miss out on the great time it would be.
Shave if it'll make you feel more comfortable
If you are female, get a one-piece suit and buy silicone cups to put in the top part.
Dear men, YOUR GENITALS ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT! I'm sure most women don't fantasize about penises, whether big or otherwise, rather than objectify mens body parts we women are more likely fantasize about our sexual partners/dream sexual partners and sex (hint: sex doesn't revolve around the penis, often doesn't involve penises at all). I can honestly say I've never fantasized about a penis.
I fantasize about how long a man's tongue is. Your penis doesn't do that much for me. Women have been kind about this issues since the beginning of time but you guys are so fing boring thinking about your penis' 24/7. Grow up. Please.
When I eat pineapples. And since I am allergic to pineapples, that would be a never.
Not that often. They scare me.
Your chances are almost zero. Very few people in the world have ever grown after age. 20. Males typically reach their final height by age 18 or 19.
No, not really. Most guys have reached their full height by the age of 18 to 19.
ONLY if your growth plates have not fused. But by 20 probably 99.99% of all men have fused growth plates.
It is, though if I were you, I would just accept the height that I'm at.
That depends on your genes. If your parents have then you probably will too.
yes, with practicing
no
The majority of women do and wouldn't mind going down on a guy if he was cute and attracted to him. Just like most men wouldn't mind sucking on a girl's vagina if she is cute. Not only is it nice to taste your partner, but it's also nice to see your partner's reaction and see that you are able to please them. It's just girls aren't as open and verbal about their sexuality, cuz they fear being labeled a $lut, etc.
Some of us do, some of us don't. It's up to the person.
Dude, she is a keeper. Don't ever let her go, lol. Most girls like it, but many don't. She seems infatuated with it and that's a good thing in my book.
Yes and rim jobs too
no ********, no relationship;[
If you have the money. Drink alot of whole milk, eat cashews, steak. Eat as much as possible. I had the same issue when I was younger. Except I was 125 at 5'11". Try to get atleast 5,000 calories in a day. When I was really gaining weight, I was eating about 8,000 calories a day. My mouth was a constant stream of food for a year. Just eat so much. Constantly.
Try banana and milk blended up as milkshakes n drink them. Lots of protein for sure. Also daily vitamins help what body may possible be lacking, helps with minerals as well
Eat more than you think you can handle, meaning when you feel full eat a couple more bites, his will make your stomach expand little by little after each meal so try to fill yourself fully. This doesn't mean make yourself eat so much your going to puke, but eat a lot more than you are used to. Fill yourself up on pasta before you go to bed, the carbohydrates turn into straight fat when you go straight to bed after eating it.
Energy dense foods like Muesli, wholegrain breads., Rice, potatoes. Bananas, Personally I find grains the most fattening things.
Eat lots of steak. It helps build muscle!
Use the my fitness app and eat lots of butter oil and other fatty foods and eat every time you aren't busy
Has your doctor tested you for hyperthyroidism?
Hormones are going nuts. Wait until you get pregnant and they really make you go off the wall. Some guy will be out at 2 am looking for pickles and ice cream that you just have to have NOW! Because they are internal and there is no pain, you don't realize that they are in flux. Tomorrow is Friday. Don't you have school at sixteen?
Yes. It is a serious mental health problem, for which you have to take some drastic steps in right direction immediately without fail. My answer is that you should fix up an appointment with a professionally qualified doctor and take proper and regular treatment.
I must say that I think you definitely do have anger issues, and you should really get a support group, or therapist! Good luck
never heard of anything like this before. perhaps mania? if you really want this to stop, when you feel angry and have the urge of throwing your phone across the room or anything like that. that just feeds it. i don't think you get angry for no reason, i think the reason is hidden, buried deep in your subconsciousness
Cancer is in our DNA. Read The Emperor of All Maladies, and then you will have a better understand of cancer (it's not one thing) and the fact that people will always get certain kinds of cancers.
First, learn what cancer is. Second, take that knowledge and apply it to your daily life. Third, live life an don't worry about it because if you have done the basics to try to avoid cancer you are probably doing well.
Yeah, basically reducing glycemic response reduces risk of cancer. so fewer carbohydrates with an atkins like diet might be effective. Also, there is a drug, metformin that is published as causing mammals to live longer while the reduction of glycemic response also reduces cancer risk. http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/20... I am not a physician
Stay out of the sun is not stupid. Melanoma is high in people who are in the sun a lot without sunblock.
Don't smoke
look up the song yolo by the lonely island, theyve got some amazing tips
Im just so freaking of the idea of me one day getting cancer. I mean like its just so devasting and just awfull. I have a friend who has cancer and im like OMG i mean i just whoaa soo devastated. How do i prevent cancer? What to do not to get cancer? How to lower cancer risks? Who is at risk for cancer? Basically what to do to never get it? Thanks im 14 btw
Who said you will? Why are you so convinced. My aunt lived to be 101 without cancer..and so did her sister. Follow the basics. Don't smoke, don't drink, exercise and eat healthy. What more can you do. You are 14 years old and you are going to spend your whole life worrying about something that you will most likely never get. Don't ruin your life. MOVE ON.
Why are you so terrified? It is fairly uncommon at your age and by the time you are old enough for it to become common, so are heart attacks, stroke etc. As a teenage, your biggest risk of death (morth than half all teenage deaths) is accident. Followed by homicide then suicide. Only about 5% of teenage deaths are due to cancer.
Ok, here we go. Don't smoke, don't vape, don't get sunburned. Get regular checkups. Everyone is at risk for cancer. You can't eliminate the chances of getting it.
There are no methods that work outside of lengthening surgery. I am a nurse for 20 years and have heard all of the so called real ways to do it. None work. Sorry. Start saving up for the surgery if you are intent on making it bigger. Truth be told, length is not what gives women pleasure. Learn how to be a good lover, and length won't mean anything.
Penis size is purely genetic. No hormone treatment of device will give you any significant results. Just be happy and have fun, just be safe.
There's nothing in the world that will increase it in size. No pills, no creams, no Voodoo chants, no ancient Chinese herbs - Nothing. What you have is what you have.
Such is not possible. Keep your money.
good luck with that
If you are 18+ and it's possible I suggest having a change of scenery. If I learnt anything it's that co-existing with heartless,nasty people only made me a self loathing awful version of myself I didn't recognise. I've made changes and slowly but surely I'm finding myself again the version of me that I thought was lost forever. Don't be poisened by the toxins any longer.
what you explain is not an abnormal situation with family deaths troubles with mean folks in schools and the world is a dog eat dog place. Maybe your reactions to such things are not normal. Try to find solace in the small things in life. Nature the beatiful sunrises and such. Try not to dwell on the down side of life. find a skilled behaviorist based psychologist and follow their program. In the meantime fake it till you make it, behave properly, help someone who is worse off than yourself. Assist and elderly person. Make some healthy choices for yourself. Best wishes.
you are not equipped to deal with all the stresses of humanity, and hardly anybody else is as well !!!! get it ?! so why do you even go there? to self destruct? you have to learn how to steer your own ship and go around the beggars and hopeless folk, and just deal with the tiny bit that you CAN HANDLE, get it?! I hate to tell you buddy, but the person to blame is yourself, for taking on the ills of the entire planet...you think you are God or something?! there's nothing fair about this effed up world.....take a stand, limit how much to put on yourself, because nobody else will do it for you.....
Carl Jung felt that he was alone in this world as well. He used it to try and help others. The trick is to discern who is simply suffering and the truly horrible. You can help yourself understand through mindfulness. http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe....
There are many choices of medication to reduce fever. Chances are pretty good that you have at least one of the following things in your home: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) Ibuprofen (Advil) Naproxen sodium (Aleve) Pick one and take it as directed. All of those are good for fever, aches, pain, and headache. Then get some sleep. If you aren't feeling better tomorrow, then go to your doctor or go to an urgent care clinic. (like Redi-Med) You should be fine.
It is normal for a fever to do that. All you need to do is take tylenol. Get under the covers and sleep. nothing more you need to do. I have had the flu for nearly 40 years every year and I am still alive.
There is a proverb. "All is well that ends well". I like such comedy. I don't like tragedy.
No, just use face wash. It's all you can do.
Not really - it could do more damage than help. Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
No but it's good for getting rid of zits or stopping them before they come. When I see my skin getting red and I know a zit or pimple is coming, i scrub the area with a lil baking soda and water and it goes away. If that doesn't work, I've used a q-tip dipped in hydrogen peroxide and rubbed it on the area and that zapped it.
Baking soda and water never worked for me. The following did though: Dandruff shampoo and Vaseline. I know it may sound bizarre, I thought so too, but it worked. I use the shampoo as a face washer and the Vaseline to help soothe it afterwards because I have sensitive skin and the shampoo turns my face red for a minute or so. I actually leave the Vaseline on all day until I go out (it also helps with aging!)  Anyways, I hope this process can help ease your pain :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNHiSi9hHjo
I've tried all kinds of home remedies you can think of (apple cider vinegar, sugar scrubs, coconut oil, egg whites ...etc.) but unfortunately, none of them worked for me. I recommend that you order a product called bevoline. Out of all the acne treatments out there, it was the only one that worked for me.
That's just ridiculous.
No, squirting is a thing, while it may seem like urine, it is actually not. Females can ejaculate too. As far as doing it too much...it shouldn't have any affects on you, probably just make you a little sore or tired. Stay hydrated though.
no, its good. there are so called "bartholin" glands in the female organ that produce a lubricant as the lady is aroused, it looks like the mans juice but of course without the s|erm in it. that lubricant flows into the female organ and squirts out by the rhytmicall org||ming contractions of the female organ :)
Newsflash for everyone. There's no such thing as "squirting"... that's piss.
No like why would my opinion matter anyway
no its very good, i am a guy and its like the hottest thing i can think of tbh it would turn me on soooo much
its messy
I ve never actually had sex, but I play with guys on skype. Delaying orgasm makes guys come like crazy. Like, a lot. One guy I played with shot almost to his nipple, another almost got it in his beard! lol. I love seeing guys come hard.
go a month without doing it.
oprah in a bikini
don't do it for a week
Use lotion

There is no rule of thumb for grieving time. Oh wait, my mother-in-law says it is two weeks. :) Some people adjust almost immediately, others take years. It depends upon the degree of attachment that the person has to the other.
As long as it takes. I lost my brother, child and my best friend close together several years ago I am still grieving.
Until you get back your original or natural mental health.
depends . if u loved them alot it cna e years. if u get depresion well....
From a request of an answer, let's see if I "Know that I don't have it," shall we? The following is 100% accurate. "In this early phase, people with schizophrenia often seem eccentric, unmotivated, emotionless, and reclusive. They isolate themselves, start neglecting their appearance, say peculiar things, and show a general indifference to life. They may abandon hobbies and activities, and their performance at work or school deteriorates." So it might be an early phase or something else entirely
Why don't you ask him his name?
Number one thing: never self diagnose. I'm guilty of that and it's never fun. You do check off some signs of schizophrenia. I have two voices that go by the names Amethyst and Marissa. Then again I check off a lot more than just that... But anyway, doctors can actually diagnose schizophrenia just by you hearing at least one voice. I'd talk to someone you trust most or call a hotline. I call Kenneth Copeland's hotline and they always help me out. Hope this helps! You can always ask me more if you need to :)
That is simply your imagination..... that is totally not Schizophrenia. How about you google "schizophrenia symptoms" and read a page or two..... then you will know that you don't have it.
She's hot as fuckkkk and obv I wanna bang, but anyways she wants to take it slow. We can chill for hours but damn, we end up talking and can't stop; so we end up being together for like 5-6 hrs randomly but pretty frequently lately.. When it gets after the 4th hr I'm just horny as **** for her and and can feel him moving.. Do everything to put him down to bed like I usually do but THAT 4TH HOUR DOES ME IN and I end up sitting there awkwardly for 15-20 mins with this raginnngggg wood nd it's so ******* uncomfortable!!
Instead of wasting your time with THAT girl, why don't you move on, because it seems like she obviously just doesn't want to only bang. Sounds like you're trying to friendship you way into sex, and that doesn't work often times. You should suggest coming over to your place(and women knows what that mean) you know if she wants sex or not.
Well either this ONE chick is a waste of your time, or she is wondering why the hell doesn't this guy move in on me. < M
control yourself man. You can't just force her to unless she really wants to
Okay, you're going to hate this answer. But you need to sit down with your parents and explain to the the condition you were in, explain to them that there really was no reason you were so depressed, and you were sick of them asking, so you made up an excuse. Say how much you regret it, and say that you were so depressed you were harming yourself, and you don't know why you said that. It'll take some weight off of your shoulders having them know, even if you don't tell the whole family.
No, it will not. No reliable source would say this. Your growth is determined by your genes. The only other things that can affect it are certain diseases (rare), severe malnutrition, and death.
No it doesn't. Exercise makes bones stronger but neither longer nor shorter
What is an ect?
Depends on the context. A DNR (do not resuscitate) order prevents resuscitation if the person dies at the hospital; advanced directives determine what kind of procedures, if any, will be used to keep a person alive. Informed Consent or Informed Refusal forms might be involved if it's not an immediate problem but the person refuses treatment for a diagnosed condition after being told about the risks.
Are you referring to a patient's decision to forego life-sustaining treatment (intubation, CPR, blood transfusions)? That would be a "Do Not Resuscitate" (DNR) order, which the patient would sign. There is also a “Discharge Against Medical Advice" (AMA) form, that a patient would sign if he wished to check himself out of a hospital against his doctor's advice. That releases the hospital from any liability or negligence in his care if he later becomes even more ill or dies.
It's alled a Refusal of Treatment or if the patient is signing out of the hospital against medical advice that is an AMA or against medical advice
You don't have to sign anything. You have the absolute right to refuse any treatment you want as long as you are able to articulate that desire. Hospitals may try to make you sign a form because it relieves them of liability should your next of kin sue, but you don't have to do it. You can just walk out.
We have them sign a form stating that they are leaving AMA (against medical advice).
Phimosis is simply the medical name for a foreskin that is too tight. You cannot fully, freely and painlessly retract your foreskin when erect, so you ARE suffering from phimosis. Your foreskin ought to have become freely retractable by about 8 years old. Phimosis does not cure itself and do you need to talk with your parents and arrange to see a doctor to get your errant foreskin sorted out.
None really needed, sounds like it is loosening up but the average age for the foreskin to mature and loosen is 15-17 so just wait and it will happen.
Sorry to hear about your foreskin problem. Your not alone most uncircumcised guys will have some type of problem in their lifetime. Your best bet is to see your doctor.
you are in develpment, let it grow, and practice. it's ok
I always watch YouTube videos and listen to music, it makes hours go by fast. Or make a chat with your friends and talk. You can go shopping or go outside and ride your bike or go for a jog.
Drink 23 pints of White Lightening, you'll regain consciousness some time on Wednesday.
just keep yourself busy
you do not have to be 18 to buy a package of disposable razors. I've been buying mine since I was 12. you also don't have to tell her or ask permission. if you go swimming other people may find it odd that you have no under arm hair.. it is not a place men normally shave
She will think it strange that you shave those areas. Men only tend to shave if they are competition swimmers. However, just say that you need to shave. Hygiene is a good idea, but you should wash rather than shaving. Apply antiperspirant if necessary.
Huh? Man up you wuss. Who cares? And where in the world do you live that you have to be 18 year old to buy shaving products? This whole question sounds bogus and phony.
Just straddle her in the night when she's asleep...and let her wake up with your shaved pùssy in her face......I think she'll get the idea.
I'm in my last year of High School, and I feel the entire damn world is against me. Most of my teachers don't even bother to try to even talk to me to see if I need help, and I'm failing math, and I think they are looking at me like I'm stupid for failing math, and it's just so damn complicated, I just don't get it, i feel this entire school is against me, and I think I'm losing it. I'm starting to hate how they're all bragging about being able to graduate, and yet I might be stuck here, and not a single goddamn person even tried to help me with my work that I'm behind on.
I failed math, too. But guess what, I can surely count money. One flunking grade shouldn't keep you from graduating. I had TWO F's...and I graduated.
Have you actually ASKED for help? Go to your school counsellor and tell him/her what's on your mind.
Talk to your counselor, they can help. You might be able to still gradate.
You need to see a therapist for your irrational fear. Nothing you have described sounds anything like cancer. Sounds like you have a freckle on your inner labia and otherwise perfectly normal genitalia. If concerned, see a doctor who can hopefully recommend a good therapist.
You seriously need help. You have been obsessing over this for months and months (and we're sick of it) and as you said, it's interfering with your normal life. Either that, or you are finding it a convenient excuse for not doing as well in school. Go to your school counselor and ask how to go about getting the help you need. Until you have taken proactive steps, please don't post the question again.
Your description is just a pigmentation pattern. Its the same thing as having a freckle on your arm - just like your mom said. Different parts of the body have different amounts of pigment, so some areas are darker or lighter than others. Also, like you said, you are letting hypochondria get the best of you, so just stop fixating on this and go do something fun and relax. If you really want to do something meaningful to improve your health talk to your mom about the anxiety issues and hypochondria and ask her if you can see a psychologist to learn how to manage these things.
I'm amazed that you're having general anesthesia for that. It's usually done in an office with local anesthesia; not even conscious sedation. As with anything in life, if you're willing to pay enough, such a service can be provided for you. But I expect that you a] won't have the financial resources to pay for elective hospitalization and b] will have a difficult time convincing any competent medical provider that such an admission is medically appropriate. In fact, you're more likely to have sequelae related to the risks of hospitalization [nosocomial infection, medication errors, etc.] than derive any potential benefit.
If this is an outpatient procedure, you won't be staying overnight. Once the anesthesia wears off, you will be sent home. The hospital does not have enough beds for people who just want to stay; it is not a hotel. And your insurance won't pay for it. The medical standard of care forbids it. The only reason you may be admitted is if there are complications from the surgery. Correction: your parents' insurance won't pay for it. I didn't notice you were underage.
If it is absolutely necessary that you stay over night they will inform you. If it's not then they will send you home. If it's just outpatient they won't let you stay unless something goes terribly wrong.
If the procedure doesn't require it, and if your doctor doesn't think it's needed, then there's no way for you to stay over-night. Also, it would cost you or your parents a LOT of money for something that wasn't medically necessary.
My children stopped being amused by the word "fart" when they were 6 years old. I'd see a mental health therapist and a Physician.
Haha my farts smelled like weed and I don't even smoke
Is there a question here,,, stop trolling before you get to far.
so what is your question
Most likely possibilities are Haemorrhoid Parasite (worms) Fungal Infection
Hemorrhoids itch. Cancers don't.
Find a female dr. if you are uncomfortable with a male dr. She has seen everything and will not be shocked or revulsed. You probably just need some cream or something.
sounds like a little hemorrhoid, no worries!
Stop freaking out and use a flushable wet wipe when you clean up down there.
The edging is the best solution for that.. But it takes time and alot of practice. Basically if you feel you wanna cvm, you stop for a moment till it subside and continue again untill you decide not to hold on. It trains your brain to control the scenario.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme will keep you hard for a few days, no problems and you can go all night. Take a few hours before the fun begins, this won't disappoint you.
There are actually delay strays and gels that you can buy to make you less sensitive. Just use a little bit or you will be too numb and you won't get off at all.
5 minutes is not premature. < M
If you are in dire need of professional advice, then GO SEE A DOCTOR! We can't examine your lump and tell you what it is. A lump in a testicle could be caused by an enlarged vein, or a cyst, or an infection -- all sorts of different things totally unrelated to a cancer. A lump caused by testicular cancer can produce the following symptoms: a dull ache in your abdomen or groin; a swelling or tenderness in your breasts; heaviness in your scrotum; a sudden collection of fluid in your scrotum; and pain. If you do not any of those symptoms, you probably do NOT have testicular cancer.
You never explained not having access to a doctor and if you ran the blood tests, why can't you read the results? Why are you looking at test result without your doctor present? Were they mailed to you? That would be very strange. Regardless of the results, you can't control whether or not you have csncer or not. You should have a doctor DESCRIBE what your results mean. Part of their job.
Putting it off is never a good idea. When will kids learn not to hide problems or put them off? My mother is a nurse for a pediatrician and they had a patient that whacked his sack on a desk pretty hard and ignored it for a month. By the time his parents noticed he was in pain he had to have one testicle removed because of his stupidity.
Blood test results are often pretty meaningless without an examination and full medical history. Go back to whoever ordered the tests and get them to interpret the results. They all fall within normal range.
Well somebody gave you blood tests.... Apparently you're pregnant.... Alpha fetoprotein is a protein produced by a fetus that is present in amniotic fluid and the bloodstream of the mother.
Look at the normal value and look at your result. Your results are all within the normal values. How did you get blood tests if you haven't had time to see a doctor?
And a professional would be a doctor.
I've had the stomach flu since Sunday, I'm not exactly sure how long this stomach flu lasts.
probably have you seen the doctor yet? well when I had the bladder flu after I stopped throwing up and stuff it stopped then some how restarted I went to the doctor and they gave me some medicine which helped in around 3-4 days. get well soon.
No, you're probably still contagious. If you need to eat (be aware you may vomit again) then eat something bland like toast or a cooked apple. Don't go to school or work yet.
I would bet no, stick to bananas, rice, and bread. NO DAIRY! And lots of water and probiotics, unsweetened yogurt is okay here as well
It is falling off you, most people lose 8-10 pounds per month on a strict eating and exercise regime and you have lost 18.5 per month so far, really it's not even healthy to lose weight that fast so be appreciative that the surgery is working but don't wish for faster loss, rapid loss rarely ends well with regards to overall health.
you have lost 37 pounds what the problem,you still have to eat right and exercise.
It is. Half a pound a day!!! In a year you could lose nearly 200.
It is falling off of you. That's about a pound every two day...
19yr guy here and I wear a t-shirt and gym shorts to bed. it's always been this way for a few years now. age 7-12 I used to sleep in my under wear. Age 12-15 I used to sleep shirtless, and age 15- present, I sleep in a t-shirt and gym shorts.
Boxers
I wear nothing in bed and have not worn any clothing there since about 10 years old. It is much more comfortable and allows the entire skin to totally relax and rejuvenate.
I don't wear anything to bed I sleep naked.
I sleep with my underwear or boxer, but sleeping naked is healthier. It makes you sleep well than with clothes due to body temperature. But keeping your feet with socks is more needed to keep your body warm to prevent from shivering in cold temperature.
T-shirt and shorts. Elastic waisted shorts. Most comfortable.
Boxer briefs
A leather codpiece, chaps, mouth gag & a riding bridle. But only when I'm alone, of course.
I sleep naked and my partner better join me in the nakedness when it comes time for bed...every night!
Nothing
Workout
You Have The Shift Key Virus Too?
You should have no problem as long as you keep hitting that shift key with every next word.
--->> Tips---> https://tr.im/greencolour1link
Hi! I'm 15 years old and I fall asleep everywhere all the time I'm constantly tired throughout the day and I can't help falling asleep I've fallen asleep in my learning support lessons, my classes, on the bus, in the car. Heck! I even fell asleep in the middle of playing a game on my iPad. I don't know what to do. Sometimes I do stuff in my sleep and I don't remember doing them. For example today I texted my nana and I don't remember doing that. I sometimes have this think when I'm half asleep and half awake but I see things and it confuses me. What should I do? Should I see a doctor?
Have your parents schedule an appointment with your family doctor. When the doctor asks what bring you in today show them what you have written here. Use that as a basis for having a frank discussion on how you are doing. They can do a full physical and neurological workup to rule out medical issues that may be causing or contributing to your issue. They can refer you to sleep specialist for a sleep study. Your doctor can also refer you to a mental health professional that can evaluate your mental state. Once the test results are in, treatment options can be discussed.
well, a certain kind of doctor, not an md....do a search in your zipcode for naturopthic physician, then look on yelp or doctgors grades or thumbtack...thumbtack asks preliminary questions to actually target someone who can help your specific need.....you'll see thumbtack after the search as well......I have gone thru energy loss, but every is different, what drained my energy is not likely what is draining yours...these people know diet and nutrition and will get to the bottom pretty quickly....best wishes
Thyroid comes to mind - but don't be too surprised when the doctor tells you that nothing is wrong. It can be a jag of teenage depression.
Yes, you should see a doctor to find out if you have narcolepsy, or low thyroid levels, low blood sugar, or something else.
I get a full good nights sleep every night
probably staying up too late at night, eating too much crap food and sweets, no fresh air or exercise
That might make lessons a bit uncomfortable. Why don't you take the day off school and see your doctor? They have some excellent pills to counteract depression these days.
Some days you’ll have setbacks, but just know that tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. You’re not alone in feeling like this. The times when you’re unwell only matter if you want them to. Just do the best you can because that’s enough.
You might end up in a wheelchair for the rest of your life, the you'll really be depressed.
I urge ou to talk to the humans at the student wellness center about how you feel, they will likely have you see a physician who will prescribe things that make you feel happier. These drugs work, I have tried them.
dont do that , the pain from getting hit by a car will be very painful, and you dont need that, get some help instead
nah b, don't
Yes, your stomach does shrink when you stop eating as much. It does not happen immediately, but will happen within a couple of weeks. You will feel less hungry even though you are eating less food. It will take less food to make you feel full.
No that's a myth .organs don't shrink. Your heart, your lungs your liver, all those are made of the same components as your digestive tract ad none of them shrink.
if you eat less than your body needs to survive your body will shrink. if you are not getting enough nutrients from food your body will digest itself starting with excess fat. so yes eating barely anything will make you lose weight. just make sure you start eating again once you reach your desired weight. you don't want to turn anorexic do you
Just as it stretched from over eating it can shrink from eating less.
Maybe so, but it's malleable. Once eating again, it'll stretch to accommodate the food eaten.
do exercise regularly and try to eat less calories food which is cooked in less oil.take green tea daily.it is good for losing fat
I love Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea . I generally loose 5 pounds after about 3 days when using. After see in my change, my sister ordered for herself from Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea
Make your food intake less than your activity level, paying attention to what you eat.
Work out every day, drink lots of water. Stick to a healthy diet. STAY CONSISTENT.
eat healthy join a gym and see a dietitian
Eat less & exercise.
Stop eating like a hog.
Friction from running may have cause that. And wearing tight shorts will do the same or sliding down from a rock may also cause it... But its normal and not a big issue unless you experience a lot of pain from that. Clean your groin to prevent infection. Be careful next time bro, we dont want our gear to be damaged.
you stated you were trying to build muscle and were jogging, jogging will not build muscle, you will lose weight, have you ever seen a muscly marathon runner and sprinters muscles are all gained from weight training, if you want fitness than jog, if you want muscles than lift weights. it's good to see you at 13 thinking of a healthy body.
U must have sat on ur balls... ask ur mom to look into it...maybe she can apply some lotion....
Not all antibiotics change the effectiveness of birth control pills, so you need to call the pharmacist who filled your antibiotic prescription and ask about that. If the antibiotics did affect the effectiveness, you would need to take the morning after pill now if you think you might get pregnant since you had unprotected sex two days ago. The longer you wait to take the morning after pill, the less effective it might be also.
Not likely. Antibiotics have no effect on contraceptive pills, thus there is no reason to take the morning after pill.
Yeah you could be, you don't know when you ovulate>
amoxicillin does not impact the pill
Nope...nothing. Don't waste your money. No cream or pill or tool, etc., ever has or ever will. You cannot get Viagra or similar meds over the counter without the a prescription; at least in the U.S.
NOTHING will make you bigger and Viagra require a prescription and why would you need Viagra at age 19? - if you're having erectile problems already, you may as well give up on life
viagra is by prescription-- see your doctor IF you can't get erections. If you can, you don't need viagra. No way to make your penis bigger either.
I wount risk it ... Many people have died from tablets and herbal pills
nope
The only way that you can get a family member into treatment without their consent is if the patient is found to be a danger to him/herself or others. Otherwise, you cannot force anyone to get psychiatric help. Even if you manage to sign the family member in against their will, many places will only hold that patient for 48 hours for observation. If the patient is deemed to be reasonably sane and not of any danger after that period of time, they will be released (possibly with medication and referrals to mental health professionals). At that point, it will be up to the individual to pursue further treatment on their own.
Mental illness is extremely unlikely to improve if the individual doesn't want to get better.
for the help to work, they need to accept they have a problem.
Hmmm
You need to get your eyes checked. You may be straining them playing the video games. You may need to wear glasses when you play.
Probably because of G-force , have you been playing with jets recently?
You may be suffering from motion sickness
The main thing is when you are masturbating, you find what feels the best and you go for it. With sex, it's more spread out if that makes sense. You will still probably finish early off the start, but don't worry about it.
Has nothing to do with being cut. But you just need to practice holding off ejaculating and reduce stimulation when you feel you are about to climax.
Being circumcised or not has no effect on the speed with which you reach your climax. Whilst masturbating, ease off a bit from time to time and this should prolong the time to climax.
Try going a week or two without masturbating, I've heard it helps.
it's normal at your age. enjoy and repeat it soon
you are excited and like me, i dont want to wait any longer
Why the hell would you want your own balls swollen? That would hurt like bloody hell! Try to avoid that...
Find someone who will kick your balls too. No! Why would you have to do that.? Youre just looking for pain.
Choke the top of your sack and stop blood flow to the balls.
put your balls on a table, then smack them with a rolling pin. Should work great.
It is not appropriate to tell someone how to cause harm to their bodies. There is no logic in damaging your testicles.
LOL... no. But the penis erection certainly affects the masturbation. (Your question doesn't make much sense... It's incomplete or something)
No, no logical reason it would. Hasn't bothered the 2 billion men on the planet that have masturbated. most for years and years.
Right after - yes. The same as with sex. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
yeah it can cause erectile disfunction if done excessively
nope
There is no answer. Yet. If you have those feelings, see a mental health professional for a complete diagnosis and a solid treatment plan.
Poor and weak mental health coupled with negligence or carelessness to take adequate care of mental health.
Pedophiles cause pedophilia
Pretty sure there's more than one potential cause. Could be abuse, could be abnormal brain structure. I don't really know.
Being abused
No one really knows. But, many pedos have been abused themselves in the past.
lack of self control. i dont think ppl get to pick what they like they ge to pick to refuse it tho.also they dont seem to see that it is terible
Fairy Queen is a homophobic old man playing out his fears and bigotry
No it's not true i am gay because i fell in love with a sexy boy at my boarding school. I also fantacised about 1 of my teachers but he was married and showed no interest in having sex with me
It wasn't a woman. He has a secret shemale lover in Thailand who convinced him to take it like a man. .
I thought it was a woman that dyed her hair dark red that moved to Adelaide
He ain't a poof, he just has a personality problem.
I do exactly the same thing whenever I feel emotionally charged but just can't get those tears out of my eyes. It's perfectly normal, sometimes people feel a lot of negative things and need a way to get them out of their system. It's liberating and makes you feel better and more positive afterwards. But if this situation starts interfering with your social life or instead of causing relief it deteriorates your emotional condition, you should talk to someone about it and get professional help. You just have to establish some boundaries between what's normal and what's toxic for your mental health.
4 years ago is a long time. Time has passed and you have healed and are not as sad. That's normal. You do whatever you want to do. It's not "bad". It's a choice. I choose not to cry, well, not choose, I couldn't cry if I tried.
Do you want to cry? Maybe you don't need too. Just because you don't cry doesn't mean you're not feeling the emotion of being sad, it can take time!

Yes
Yes, and very pleased that my parents thought enough for my long term health and sexual pleasure to give me the gift of circumcision as an infant.
No I'm uncircumcised.
yes and proud of it
No I am uncut. regards.
I'm 17 year old guy. I've been the height 5 foot 7 since I was 11, and I've been weighing 126 pounds since I was 13. I am still 5'7 and 126 pounds is this too much to eat? I count calories and this is what I eat everyday(I am vegetarian and eat the same things everyday) Breakfast- 260 calories Lunch- 400 calories Dinner- 200 calories I eat no meat/ fish/ pasta/ fast food or startchy stuff. But do I really eat too much in a day? Those are accurate calorie counts, because I only eat things that I know the calorie amount in them. I lift 2 hours(20 pound weight) 4 times a week 2 hours each day.
No, it needs more than double that, specially when lifting a 20 pound weight for 2 hours each day. if the ammount of food is a problem, then three ounces choclate will get about 1200 additional calories, three ounces is a so little volume, like 4 chcoclate bars, even a 10yo can eat that in one afternoon.
No, not at all. You should be eating approximately 1,512 calories a day. It sounds like you do not give your body enough energy to keep going.
Way to little. You are a male anorexic and will end up in an early grave if you don't get help
It is not okay to eat a package of bacon everyday. That is too much fat and salt and preservatives. It could make it more likely that you would eventually have high cholesterol and heart disease. It has little nutrition, so it would be almost empty calories. If you want to gain weight, eat nutritious but calorie dense foods - avocados, dried fruit, nuts, hummus, beans, peanut butter, cheese and other dairy products. And start a weight lifting program which will also help you gain weight.
Bacon is high in saturated fat and eating a lot of it could affect your cholesterol. It's not good for your heart. High-fat foods that are better for you are things like nuts and avocados.
That is a horrifyingly bad way to gain weight. You'll need open heart surgery before you hit your 40's.
the salts and preservatives might be hard on your heart and circulatory system.
Voice pitch in guys changed overtime specially when puberty, like your voice deepens then go high pitch at the same time like its unstable but sooner it will permanently deepens. It takes time for your voice box to develop and compensate to your body changing. Either way your a good guy coz you choose the right way not to kill those guys. Let their mocks and tease enter your left ear and exit on your right ear... They are jerks so its a waste of your time if you do the same. Be strong bro.
Don't take it hard. He's just a lowlife kid trying to bully. I wouldn't have even thought of suicide before sucker punching him square in the face.
I think I would consider clobbering this guy WAY before I'd even begin to think of suicide. In fact, I don't think suicide would have even entered my mind at all. So that just leaves clobbering.
Well suicide is way over-reacting to some jackass. Start calling him Jack in fact, and let others know what it is short for.
The stuff works. it's no miracle pill. You still have to do the other 90% of the hard work for this to have much effect.. But I like it because it's not so extreme on the body like other Fat Burners. Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea gives me a clean energy boost when I need it, helps suppress my appetite, and gives me those extra deep cuts that I need for my modeling profession
When you first start losing weigh it is often very rapid but will slow off. As long as you're losing the weight in a healthy way (ie. not crash dieting or any other weird fad diet) it should be fine
It depends how your losing the weight to be honest, if your eating atleast 3 meals a day and getting all the nutrients you need, then it's fine.
n
Nope. Not Breast cancer in any way shape or form. Sounds like your hormones. Quite possibly a cyst....see your gynecologist. But don't expect him to say Breast Cancer. He will most likely send you for a simple ultrasound to find out what's going on.
At your age the risk of breast cancer is 1 in 1.3 million. Wgat you are describing sounds more like hormonal breast development.
Those are not symptoms of breast cancer, dear. There's never pain, there's never red or itchy.
No it's not breast cancer. Hard lumps are formed on breasts in breast cancer.
Sounds more like a skin allergy
You're old enough to analyze your eating and exercise habits. You can advocate for healthier food and activity classes. Consider the fact that this didn't happen overnight. Even if you lose by some means, without figuring out the problem, you'd end up back to square one over time. So if you'll do anything or literally so, start with yourself and your responsibility. If necessary, talk to someone about how to eat nutritiously .
Join 2 sports.
Cut out all kinds of sugar and processed foods. Chips, biscuits, cake, chocolate, lollies, soft drink, juice etc. isn't real food and our bodies don't need it. Just by eliminating sugar you will make a huuuuuge positive impact on your health.
Did you know that you'll get bad teeth as a result of throwing up? How about actually not eating junk food and excercising?
Talking to your doctor and parents would be good. Maybe they can help you come up with a healthy plan.
You think that was an accident ?? DO YOU KNOW how long I worked on that formula ?? DO YOU KNOW how many other flavors I tested before I came across that one ?? How many licorice-flavored marshmallows I had to choke-down ?? Sawdust-flavored ?? I thought I had it in barn-beam-flavored, but NO.... Back to the test tubes. And now, That I perfected the perfect flavor, I can't even eat any, because all of my teeth have fallen-out. I'm going home & have a good cry, just because of you....
SUGAR...... too bad it's so absolutely deadly. Every wonder why there's so many fat people in America - JUNK food is largely SUGAR. Marshmallows are just a special Big Sugar treat.
if you knew what they were made out of you might stop eating them. A key ingredient is gelatin. Gelatin is a protein obtained by boiling skin, tendons, ligaments, and/or bones with water. It is usually obtained from cows or pigs.
Can someone plz tell me if you think this is a UTI? Doctors didn't give me a straight answer. They said don't take antibiotics unless you have symptoms. I've had 'low numbers' of bacteria in my urine culture and its the same bacteria for the past 8 months. I don't have pain or burning when i urinate, my urine color looks normal, no blood in the urine. I sometimes have frequent urination. The doctor said if i have no symptoms then don't take antibiotics. My urinalysis was normal and has been normal most of the time.
@Rain why are you wasting time answering my questions if you're just going to be a stupid troll and attack me for no reason? You have no life For those who are wondering, I do ask this because the doctor did not say yes or no but the type of bacteria i researched it and it is a bacteria that can cause infections.
I've had UTI without blood or burning and i had a normal urinalysis but had a urine culture that had bacteria. So your doctor didn't give a straight answer.
i'm sorry you have these idiot trolls answering your questions. The doctor might not have considered it a true infection because it was a low count, for urine cultures, it has to be a certain amount of bacteria in order for it to be an infection. It's not good to keep taking antibiotics because it can damage your immune system.
Rain, The asker of this question said that the doctor didn't say whether it was an infection or not. Usually urine does not have bacteria grow in it. Your doctor might have said don't take antibiotics because if you keep taking it, it would become more resistant and they'r not good for you.
It is possible that there is "outside" bacteria getting into the sample, when you pee. It is really hard to get that area "down there" totally clean when peeing in the cup. If you have no symptoms and other labs are normal, then you will be fine. To have a UTI without those symptoms of urgency or burning or even blood, is very rare.
I don't know, what DO you call an ophthalmologist who doesn't know what type of cataract is in a patient's eye?
A poor opthamologist. Do you know what you call the person who graduated with the lowest marks in their medical school? Doctor. And my favorite law joke. What do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 80? "Your honor."

A couple of guys in my class were saying they jack off several times everyday. Idk how that is even possible since a lot of people are busy but I do it like 2-3 times a week in the shower if I'm up for it. I'm 16 and a guy but I don't do that everyday..it's kind of awkward cuz I live in a small house and share a room with my younger bro so yeah...lol. Not much privacy for me I guess. How many times a week/day do you jack off? I'm curious cuz I thought I was normal but these guys laughed saying I'm a prude? -.-
I typically do it at least once a day (probably about 8-10 times a week). I'm 16 btw. This is completely honest
I'm 16 too, if it's a school week, I only do it on the weekend, if were on a break then everyday 90% of the time only once a day during the breaks.
Vcation time was great so i do it everyday or 5-6 times a week, and sometimes jackoff 2-3 times a day, i just can help myself coz its freaking good, i mean its so goood😋😉😵. Totally honest.
I do it around 2-4 or so times a week, but some people I know do it every day.
Use to do it every day but now I'm more like 2 twice a week , but sometimes I'll do it back to back in that same day, just can't help it feels too good haha 😂
When I was younger, it was about four times a week. The problem with doing it every day is that you are doing it just to do it and not because of any real need
Well masturbation is normal natural and healthy and you can't do it too much. What you do is fine however.
it's personal, expecially at your age. from many times a day to once a month. later it slows...
No. I only do it 1-2 a week so the orgasms becomes intense.
You can't. They will do what they want without any regards to you.
torture them until they stop.... nah kidding. Just ask them politely or buy them an e-cig.
let him take nicorette! it shall take away the desire of smoking
remind them what they are doing to themselves
He must have offended a barber in a former life.No,seriously,a steady supply of razors can trump this "karma".
That's what electrolysis is for.
You are a disgusting garbage person.
The basic difference is the presence or absence of a foreskin. Provided there is nothing wrong with the foreskin there is no difference in the overall performance of either type. However, a high proportion of uncircumcised males have some problems with their foreskin at some time in their lives (phimosis, recurrent infections, etc). Being circumcised eliminates these problems. Sexual feeling and pleasure is not reduced by circumcision but can actually be enhanced.
Uncircumcised penis as foreskin that covers the head. Circumcised penis as no foreskin so the head is exposed.
An uncut penis will have an outer sheath that may cover part or all of the head, especially when flaccid.
One is a partial penis that lacks the original protective and sensory features and has no mobile erogenous tissue. The other is natural and allows NATURAL SEX -- what we all evolved to have.
My girl friend told me her husband liked Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product. They have better sex because of it. Going to give it a try too.
One has a foreskin attached, the other doesn't.
One is circumcised, and the other is not...!
About an inch of skin.
one is mutilated and lack some funcionality, the other is normal and fully functions ok
So lately I've been having this problem where I want to use the bathroom and after I do, around 2 minutes later I feel like I have to go again but only a few drops come out, and then I start to feel this massive burning sensation that is extremely uncomfortable and painful. I hardly have any spare time in my hands so until I arrange an appointment with my doctor what should I do to lessen the pain a bit?
when i was age 9-12, i got many bladder infections. The symptoms are identical to what you are describing. They never did find out why. I kept getting them and the doctor would give me this pink medicine that tastes like bubble gum to get rid of it. Then it would come back a few months later. They stopped completely eventually and never came back.
Go to the ER. You are suffering from an infection.
Don't have sex with prostitutes any more
If your circumcision was done correctly (as over 99% are) then you would have no foreskin to cover (or stick to) your glans (penis head). That is the whole point of getting circumcised! Swelling is normal after circumcision but should start reducing once the stitches are all out. Full healing can take 6-8 weeks. Please see http://www.circinfo.com/post-op_care/car... for useful advice on the post-op care of a new circumcision. If you are still worried about the healing of your circumcision then consult the surgeon as he has a continuing duty of care towards you until the wound is fully healed.
Your question doesn't make any sense. What are you trying to ask? If you are circumcised there is no foreskin to stick to anything.
If you want a best solution, feel free and frank to disclose all the secrets. Nothing happens in this world without any reason. I think your ego wants to hide your mischief.
Kinda the whole point of getting cut is to have the foreskin no longer cover the head
I smoked weed for a year everyday. Then I had a manic episode and was diagnosed bipolar. I quit smoking and i am on bipolar medication. Risperidone, Benztropine, and Lamotrigine. I feel like the psychiatrists are just taught to keep patients on medication for the rest of their lives, i dont think i need to be on medication because i think the manic episode came from smoking too much weed. What do you think? and has anyone smoked weed and then later find out that they are bipolar? i never had mood swings my entire life! this manic episode just came out of the blue
No. Pot does not cause Bipolar. That's how mania happens.... One day you don;t have then the next day you do.... although it tends to start slowly and build.... In my group (Bipolar support) lots of people use pot to help with some of their symptoms. It helps some people and in others it causes anxiety and paranoia... but it can't cause any mental disorder.
I would suggest seeing a mental health professional, as soon as possible. Individuals taking illegal drugs, even marijuana, are not to be diagnosed while on drugs. If you were doing marijuana for a year consistently then I am sure your behavior was linked to the marijuana usage, Marijuana is said to possibly cause temporary psychosis but you cannot be properly diagnosed when on drugs nor does drugs cause bipolar disorder. You may have been improperly diagnosed.
You are quite wise doctors are indeed taught to push medications and keep people on them. Not only does big pharma fund medical schools they give kickbacks to doctors to prescribe more. Bipolar can be treated with a magnesium supplement as lack of magnesium affects the brain.
Every time I have gone off my bipolar psych meds I have fallen into a manic episode or a depression episode. If you are prescribed meds, stay on them.
OMG no weed does not cause any disease, matter of fact its been proven to help bipolor individuals and those with PTSD,
yes shake the penis after you come back from the gym and then go to sleep
Assume you mean you masturbate- normal and would have nothing to do with working out- unless you tend to leak a bit after ejaculating which means you have to watch you don't leak in your gym shorts. But many guys will masturbate before working out.
better than shaking hands
Why would we care what you do with your penis???
Depends where you shaking it. < M
not to me
No sugar, no soda, no bread, no pasta, no rice, no potato. Lots of water, all the meat, chkn and fish you can eat, bacon too. Lots of vegetables. Do that for two weeks, if you like the results, look up Atkins diet and follow the rest of the program. What you are doing is shocking your system to start attacking stores of energy (fat) because you are not providing any carbs, which turn into sugar, which gets stored as fat. Add in exercise, walk your dog for an hour a day is fine to start.
Summer is here , get ready for the next year summer, and do it slowly an properly .... A tip I can give you if that when it come to the front the back is way too important ... so work out your back .. Please ignore the adkins guy , ackin is already death and his diet sucked ..

Your brother.
Your grammar suggest that you're the one with special needs.
It depend on the underlying condition of the seizures. The only way I can think that MIGHT cure the seizure is BioPQQ which grows new michondria in the brain cells. That would cure seizures, but the undeyling condition is not mentioned.
Yes
There is no cure for seizures, only treatment
seizures do not get cured, but medication tends to keep them under control. in extreme cases surgery is used.
Yes. My husband takes medication for his seizures. It doesn't care them, it just prevents them from happening.
You can be cured naturally in 20days..Stop all medicines for 20days...Avoid milk products,sweets,dry fruits and nonveg for 20days..You can eat other foods.Daily drink unfiltered juice of 15 spinach leaves,15gms of celery and 15gms of raddish..Read the famous book - Heal yourself 101 by Markus Rothkranz.see my profile
It might help if the headache is being caused by dehydration. How much water do you drink on a daily basis? Your body needs 8 litres a day to maintain a healthy body. I have found that if I put half a measured teaspoon of Bicarbonate of Soda into a pint glass of water; stir it; and then leave for five minutes before drinking it; about five to ten minutes later my headache disappears.
If your headache is caused by not eating. But if its caused by chemicals or stress (same cause stress releases chemicals). Or if it's caused by muscles than no. Cause chemicals only a countering yet better chemical will work. That's why ciggarettes and energy drinks/soda sometimes help headaches. Sometimes food does. This is also why thousands of people around the world move to colorado. Because weed tinctures are the only thing that can treat this in children (painful head problems that insurance refuse or doesn't diagnose).
I suggest a bottle of water and a melatonin, with a good 12 hour sleep will cure that right up
It depends on the type of headache you have. There are several different types of headaches and migraines
Perhaps if your affliction is due to dehydration, otherwise you would be better off with some good ol' aspirin.
Torasic extention is the part of livin and water is the soul

Ya thousands of women online, and probably millions throughout history, have done it with great success. A quick google can find their first hand stories, especially in forums and blogs. Google female deer massage for the proper technique. Any oil or lotion prevents you from rubbing your skin to the point of irritation, and flax oil is especially popular.
No. Massaging does nothing. All you can do is eat healthily and let nature take its course.
Don't think so. All these methods of unnatural boob growth are generally myths or scams. Just let them do their thing. Nothing wrong with varying bra sizes, I wouldn't worry.
Only if boys massage them. That's what I heard.
No. I can cause swelling and bruising. The swelling is not permanent.
sorry not true
You have definitely got above average size cock. It may increase to 8 inches by the time you are 18 years of age. Enjoy my dear friend. Regards.
Not average at all. Most guys are fully done in length by 15. Average is only 5.16 inches, so you are huge. less than 5% are 7 inches or more.
you're above average, buddy. but you won't stop growing until about 21.
it is a stupid question. what's good about a big penis? the answer is nothing. they are ugly and uncomfortable for us girls.
Hopefully not as the majority of girls are not keen on too long!!
It will t grow. Good... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...

I checked up oral herpes on the internet and I saw the picture ( see url 1) and I do believe I had those on my inside of lips... But i only had them when I accidentally bit my inner lips, then that occurs and after like 2 days or 3.. It disappears like there was nothing.. That means I have oral herpes or not? And is it really dangerous? Things to note: - only get it when I accidentally chew my inner lip while eating - Never got it on my tongue - What I believe is, that is might only be pus... Now I'm not sure so that's why I'm asking you guys. Thanks.

For me it's not an oral herpes...
if you have a serious medical issues, you go to the doctor.
Relax and remember: Worrying brings nothing good to what your worrying about. It's only meaningful to try to improve it.
Have you ever fixed anything just by worrying? I bet we can't, so why bother, it just stresses you out, I guess ignoring is the answer. http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communi... Matthew 6:27-29 (NKJV) 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? 28 “So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
1) It's hard but talk to a parent or friend just someone trust worthy and close. 2) Do something to take your mind off things. 3)Plan the next day so everything makes you feel in place 4)Lay down and breath just take little steps and do relaxing things like a mini spa night 5)Watch a good movie while doodling out your feelings HOPE THIS HELPED :):):)
I think you just understand things more than others. You know that death is going to happen eventually so you just accept it. I'd get help if you consider badly hurting others or yourself though
No, you are not thinking right. You are missing love. Do you know Jesus? You have an unloving and uncaring spirit. Without Jesus in your life, you will do as the devil wishes. This will get worse and you will harm someone and be placed in prison.
Why would you ask something so silly? All boys masturbate. Always have, always will. Boys masturbate to some degree from very early age after they are out of diapers. Not sure why this is a source of confusion for you. That's pretty unusual.
It is a natural thing to do but not every day of the week as it can put you at a higher risk of prostate cancer when you are older but once or twice a week is ok. Google it
Not only is it 'okay' to masturbate, it is perfectly normal, natural and healthy for you (and everyone else) to masturbate. It's NOT going to damage your health in any way. Nor will it adversely affect your sexual health or sex life (now or in the future).
Yes it's ok to masturbate, it will not harm your health in anyway.
Yes, it is perfectly fine to masturbate.

It's an average, and probably pretty accurate because many women today are married and didn't really believe in premarital sex, as for modern girls, I'd say in some cases maybe 10-20 people. When you consider virgins and people with life partners it does average out to be pretty low. Though with any statistic there are the extreme cases
I think the number is closer to 6 or so. But then it would depend on the age of the woman, if she's married, single or divorced. There are a lot of variables. t
3-400.

If you're an average person picking up your Marlboros and Camels at the store then yes. It's not just nicotine. There's tar and all sorts of chemicals and additives. Growing and rolling your own is a much better option as you're just getting the nicotine. A lot of people don't realize just how long people have been smoking and that the widespread cancer didn't begin until commercial production and tobacco giants started growing to keep up with mass demand. And how do you do that? Stretching out your product with additives.
Cigarettes contain nicotine, tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic and DDT are just a few of the additives in cigarettes. In 1994 cigarette companies submitted a list of 599 different additives to the US Dept of Health and Human services. Look it up, it's scary.
That's an interesting way of phrasing the question: 'It's just smoke and nicotine.' Nicotine is a chemical which as a number of negative effects on your body. It causes increases in blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, nervousness and irritation of the lungs. Tobacco smoke causes irritation of the lungs. A number of the components of tobacco smoke are carcinogens. Smoking cigarettes greatly increases your chances of getting cancer of the lungs, trachea and mouth. You could also say "What's so bad about being shot by a gun? It's just a rapidly moving piece of metal."
My dad died from emphysema when he was 60, from smoking and years later so did my sister. I am having issues now myself because although I've never smoked, I grew up in a smoking household. 60 may seem like a really old age to you, but we should all plan on living in good health until we're at least 80, so they threw away 25 percent of their lives. And if 25 percent doesn't seem like a lot to you, then start sending me 25percent of your paycheck, okay? And can you imagine gasping out the last 5 or so years of your life?
Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including 43 known cancer-causing (carcinogenic) compounds and 400 other toxins. These include nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, as well as formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic, and DDT. Nicotine is highly addictive.
I'm a funeral director by profession. I can't tell you the number of cases of lung and heart related issues that were brought on by smoking that resulted in the early death of hundreds of people each year. That's just in my place of business alone! There's significant amounts of tested, tried and true studies that show ciggerates as a highly deadly habbit.
I would ask my Mom but she died in her 40's from smoking related cancer. I would ask my Dad but he died in his 50's from smoking related cancer. He was alive long enough to help my Grandma rehab through surgery when half her tongue and jaw had to be removed due to cancer from smoking. She died about 1 year before he did. So I really can't come up with a reason why anyone would think they are not bad for you.
Well, I really don't know the risk of smoking cigarettes but I do believe you will experience consequences if you continue.
Only if you smoke them or chew the tobacco. Otherwise - cigarettes especially the tobacco mixed with water make a great insect toxin & repellent when sprayed on your plants. It is an organic means to keep your plants healthy.
"its JUST smoke and nicotine" and tar, carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, arsenic DDT... As a general rule of thumb, if you're intentionally inhaling substances that are also used as bio-chemical weapons, insecticides and for animal extermination - its time to seriously reevaluate your life.
Why are you being peed on?
No. And of all the ways to imitate Kim Kardashian, this is probably the worst. Knock it off.
Yes and a std
Yass.
As long as it reaches your pee hole, yes. The infection starts from down there.
no
Normal
Normal. Maybe you just have big bones
That is totally normal. Don't worry!!
Have someone take some pictures of you. You will see u are normal. Get rid of your skinny friends they will make u feel fat.
The target weight for someone 5'5" is 120-140lbs.
If you look like you are over weight then that answers your question buddy
Who likes going to the doctor? No one that i know of.. but it's a necessary evil, like eating. It's just a part of our lives. and no one can help you online. No one can see your throat or talk with you about your symptoms and make a diagnosis on the internet. Take care of your health. You only have one throat. Best wishes
My avowed policy in life is: "Help ever and hurt never". I wonder how I can achieve this objective. They (professionals) want their fees/charges in advance. Where can I find the required money I also need some more money for taxi charges to bring that heath professional to your house. Please don't misguide me and confuse my mind. Give me proper advice so that I can render maximum help to you at this critical juncture. By the way who is that heath professional.
You've been posting about your throat for over a year now. If you were really that sick for this long you'd be dead already. You have OCD about your throat. Throat this throat that throat throat throat throat. See a psychiatrist.
They would probably tell you to get some cough medicine and wait it out but if it persists then go see one anyway
Well, if you could describe your symptoms, it might help.
I'm 14, and I constantly feel alone and empty. I also have suicidal thoughts a lot. My mom and dad are Christian, and when I tell them about me being upset, they only say that I need Jesus. The only thing is, I'm agnostic. I've told my mom that I want to see a therapist (in confidence that she wouldn't tell my dad) and she did and he said he "wouldn't let the world take hold of my mind." I don't know what to do. My dad makes me feel like **** and my mom doesn't understand my situation. I'm scared that I will act on my urges to commit suicide. I'm not ready to die. Please help
No worries, everybody does that. That black dot will disappear.
You looked at the sun BY accident, not ON accident. What , did you do it again already or are you just repeating yourself. You asked 10 minutes ago. Give people time to answer.
Does it go away.You know just relax.you'll be fine or maybe not but don't look at the sun again.
It's perfectly fine. For some guys, theirs is tight, and might not roll back all the way, or even very far. Sometimes, not even past the head.
Not a computer hardware question is it? Try Health
Is it ok? Well Duh! You should have been pulling your foreskin back everyday and washing under there since you were a small boy. I'm guessing by your question you have not been doing this!!! SMH.
it s ok, everybody grows up in different time. you are not synchronized with others
Normal.
Yes, it is quite normal and common for guys to have a large vein on their penis.
Most guys have a very prominent vein on their shaft, may even bulge out a lot.
Yes, perfectly normal.
we all have a huge vein running down from our pubic base to our helmet.
Yes I think a lot of guys have this .
yes; venous system in it is not symmetric
Doubt you need one for a handful - I love handfuls, they almost fit in my mouth
Is is aconsequence of a woman's lifestyle since childhood almost the same degree as it happens to other professionals who do not have a few áreas of their body enhanced. Some male fighters are able to hide their testicles during the time they are performing and a woman who has pointed and heavier breasts certainly was subjected to a diferente kind of routine that could preserve the glands that way and not press them against their chest. Bras do not fir in the category of sacks or bags.
Most bras are a handful. Have you ever tried to hold two bras in one hand? It's tough
New at this are we? Bra size has nothing to do with it.
depends on the size of the hand.
depends on how big the hands are
depends on your hands.
Taking plan b seriously disrupts periods,i do not know why she took two plan b one is quite enough if taken less than 72 hours after sex, and as you used a condom she was not pregnant anyway, plan b is a massive dose of hormones and should only be taken as a last resort,the long term effects of taking it are not known yet, she will just have to wait, she should be bleeding pretty soon, if she isnt then the plan b may nor have worked,but don't worry as you used a condom.
If you guys used a condom then plan B was really overkill. It can absolutely delay your period, depending on when in your cycle you take it. It says this, quite clearly, if you bother to read the directions. And in this case she is not. even. late. I'd reconsider whether you are ready for sex if it stresses you out this much.
It was supposed to ARRIVE today or tomorrow? Call the shipper and ask why she didn't get it already when you paid for overnight.
I starve myself. Not because i want to, it just happens. Im only 19, i dont want to ruin my body, but i cant help it. Im really skinny, i want curves. I dont enjoy eating no more ( my mums a great cook, iv got plenty of money to buy food, not to forget to mention i live in Melbournes CBD- Plenty of options)...But i feel sick everytime i eat breakfeast, and i rarely eat through out the day. Today i ate a mini cupcake, took me alot of work to it that.
I would definitely see a doctor to ask about why you have such a little appetite- perhaps you are unwell! Though I don't want to startle you, it would give you some peace of mind to have some tests done to see if there is anything you can do medically to help you eat more and get those curves you want, and feel better internally! I am sure you look lovely either way so I hope you don't feel insecure about your body in the meantime :)
I would see a doctor. A dietician, And a Gastroenterologist to find out what is behind the reason why you feel sick.
If I were you I would see a doctor. You either have an eating disorder or some other serious health issue.
So I've recently gone through a large weight loss, I've shed about 60 pounds in the past eight-nine months, and I think I've hit my plateau here at 150. I'm having trouble losing anymore weight without essentially starving myself. The thing is, I think I'm pretty happy where I am. I never thought I would be this slim in the first place, and I don't really feel a need to lose much more. I'm just not sure if this is normal compared to other people's POV. Being obese most of your life really changes how you see different weights. So what do you think?
It's really great that you managed to lose 60 lbs. 150 lbs is still overweight for your height but much less overweight than 210 lbs was. If you want to break your plateau I suggest you try either the 5:2 diet or the 16:8 diet. Google them for more info.
Try to maintain for a year. If you succeed, start dieting again. In the interim, watch portions and don't drift back to old behaviors. That's what I do once I lose. I start baking cakes and overeating.
You need to work out your BMI (Body Mass Index). You can use this online calculator: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educatio... Your BMI is 25.7, which puts you just into the overweight category. If you could lose just another 10 pounds, then your BMI will reduce to 24, which puts you in the healthy weight category.
Yes. If you are male, it might be OK if its mostly muscle but a female should be about 120.
No, Vitamins do not cause constipation. But while you where at the doctor, why didn't you ask for relief for that. Try some glycerine suppositories for the constipation. You can buy those at any pharmacy
Prune Juice!
No. You have a deficit. taking them is necessary to correct it. Use fiber like metamucil fiber capsules. Eat more plant foods, grains, nuts, seeds, fresh produce. Drink more water. Get sunshine.
Have you pooed at all in the last 11 months?
Yes. Soon your whole body will be one big turd.
These things are left to your sweet will and choice. You can do either this way or remain silent. Silence is golden.
Yes.
lol go for it "feel the bern"
...and I thought my Saturday night was going bad.
go for it if it makes you happy
no, use a fireplace log.
Ok.
Most like to be GAD (general anxiety disorder) but could be a few things (thyroid can cause similar symptoms sometimes.) see a dr
Doubtful. chest pain in teens is pretty common, usually only anxiety or gas.
-A Trip to the Doctors- quite Soon ! :o
Don't chew for a few days and apply ice. It will help some.
If you can chew or open your mouth fully, you'll likely be fine.
You just have a bruise or you're sore from it, it'll go away
wow, I would go to a doctor asap.
Hatred is based in selfishness and fear. So get in control and quit thinking that all people need to do as you say.
Maybe you could pick one specific group of people to hate, like coeds who part their hair in the middle. Focus all your anger on them.
Advice? You're on the right track.
Yep. Educate yourself and get some friends.
Get professional help before you end up alone and miserable.

I have read that cigarettes suppress appetite. So I have started smoking cigarettes to help with my binge eating and to make me stop wanting to eat every 5 seconds. I have been smoking 1 cigarette before each meal or whenever im hungry. I dont think its working because i still have a big appetite for food and still end up overeating. What am I doing wrong? P.S I know its bad for me so do not give me a lecture on why its bad or i will report your comment.
Because it's a horrible, horrible myth. Cigarettes do NOT suppress appetite.
dumbest reason to pick another bad habit..so you where a fat *** hungry hippo eating machine and now you are a cighead yikes
In order to stop your binge eating, you need to know why you binge eat. My suggestion is to speak to a professional who specializes in binge eating disorder.
Track your calories and weigh in every day. At the end of each week, average all your daily weigh-ins. Compare with the previous week's average. If it's going up, reduce your daily caloric intake by 200 calories. If it's the same, reduce your caloric intake by 100 calories. You can add in core workouts like body weight stuff (push-ups, planks, sit-ups, crunches, leg lifts, pull-ups, squats, etc.), but weight loss is 80% diet and 20% exercise. DO NOT start fad diets like paleo, adkins, zero-carb, low-carb, and any other Dr. Oz nonsense. They are unhealthy, unsustainable, and useless except for fat, lazy people that think there is a magic answer to their weight problems.
You eat mcdonalds every day for breakfast. You eat Taco bell for lunch . White castle for dinner. You should keep the weight off.
To lose, eat less and work out. Losing and maintaining are separate skills. I believe you can lose. The weight creeps back and constant vigilance us necessary.
gfgj
eat vegetables duh, do cardio, its all simple ****, if you dont have to motivation then **** off and stay fat for life you cow
STOP EATING YOU COW
Chickens make the best protein. Breast and eggs will net you all the protein you could want.
As far as protein that matches what the body needs and in high concentrations, chicken.

egg and almond

I guess mine is of the success stories. I'm an older guy who has been having troubles in the bedroom for the past few years. Three of Prolargentsize natural capsules a day, and I feel like I'm 20 again. When I was taking Viagra, my erections would last an hour after sex, which was very uncomfortable. This works exactly as I need it to. For needed people Prolargentsize has its own website to order from.
It depends upon what you're doing at the time. If you are doing something lewd, then yes... it would be offensive. But if you're just going on about your business and happen to get a random erection and are doing your best not to draw attention to yourself, then no... it's not offensive. Embarrassing... yes but not offensive.
No its not a offense i mean you wont get arrested for this but its a very unprofessional or rather a very embarrassing thing to happen when you are in public.
I was a bit skeptical about buying this because I feel like some of these just don't get the job done but I wanted to please my lady more and boy oh boy this did the job as said. I love this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme product and would definitely recommend to other people needing a little boost.
No, not generally. The most you'll most likely get is several glances at it. Have you seen the erection cam videos? No one called the police over a penis standing proudly.
If you're showing it off, it's at least rude. We all get them, of course, but in public, it's best to not call attention to your b0ner.
Of course not, otherwise alot of guys are in jail now. Its completely normal and doesnt do any of the offense you probably know.
I would say, "yes". In today's world it is offensive. Evidently, society refuses to publicly accept that erections even occur. The clothing industry does nothing to help conceal. Religions erroneously seem to consider erections to be totally controllable.
No. If you just didn't say anything about it obviously and acted as if you didn't notice, I don't think anyone would care.
you might like the new "Not Your Daddy's Root Beer" I don't like it because it is too sweet even for Root Beer! And yes, it has an alcohol content of 17% same as regular pale ale or lager or dark beer!
Beer is an acquired taste. No beer is going to be good for you if you expect it to taste like soda.
Light beer is terrible. Just avoid it if you can. I know a lot of people like Sam Adams and they have a variety of tastes. I honesty never grew to like it. More of a wine drinker
Bud light is one of the most mild tasting beers there is. All beer has a bitter taste and it is most pronounced when new to drinking.
Try Kriek - Belgian beer that they add cherries to during the final fermentation (avoid the fake Kriek they make with syrup!). YOU won't like St. Louis Kriek as that is THE sourest Kriek, I love it.
Corona is really good. You might like Rollin Rock which is lighter than other beers. Or there is Blue Moon which is fruity.
In the long term YES. In the short term you'll have a very bad stomach ache which may require a hospital visit if the pain gets too severe.
probably and not to mention you will also get a bad stomachache, not a good idea to carry a lot of fat around, you can get all kinds of health problems that way
Yeah thats tooo much
Not after a one off but if you do it regularly then yes.
SICK and Fat.
Morning wood, its completely normal... Your dad knows that. It happens at least 4 times and when you wake up its the last time of erection... Theres nothing to worry about.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme worked amazingly. Kept getting me hard for almost 4 days and I felt huge! Could last longer the first time, then was hard and ready again in minutes. The second time lasted forever. Well worth it to me!
It is an incomplete sentence, i.e. without a verb. Where is it in your question. I mean where is "is" in your question.
Your dad should know it is normal.
OH MY GOSH!!! Oh I can't breathe LOL
get dressed
It can but you will never really see a difference unless you do other things to help you lose weight - mainly eat healthy. Why? Your body gets used to jogging and therefore everytime you must push harder and harder for any result.
I really like this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product because it actually works..which is rare! I have already lost 2 pounds, and it has only been a week! I will continue using this supplement until the bottle runs out, and I plan on purchasing another bottle or two to keep me on track.
Oh yes - but remember that it's MUCH more important what you eat than how much you exercise. So try not to hurt yourself exercising. But get a good book on a real food diet and get off the junk food. Get Dr. Fuhrman's "Eat To Live" off of Amazon - his whole deal is the highest nutrition possible - which means the lowest calorie, highest fiber too.
no, typically ppl jog when they're trying to bulk up. never do cardio to lose weight. it's like eating a pie to get a six pack
Yes. Artificial knees are much lighter than human bone-based knee joints
yes it will
It sure can ....
Circumcision is a proven prophylactic procedure that has many benefits and no drawbacks. When done in infancy the baby hardly notices it and all is fully healed in a few days. It is a bit more complicated for an adult and takes longer to heal, but overall the health and sexual benefits are generally worth it.
You're so right!!! We have a foreskin for a reason if we didn't need it we wouldn't be born with it
It IS rough if done to an adult. If you want, you can continue to have the equivalent of an extra armpit to wash.
i recommend it, but was done as a baby
The gym is probably one of the worst places to meet women.... Many women(or many people, for that matter) are usually there to focus on their workout. Some might see you interrupting them as distracting or even annoying. There's plenty of better places to meet new women.
Gyms are not dating/mating sites. Women go to the gym to work out, not get hit on by every guy there.
People are at the gym for a reason - and it isn't that. If you want to meet people at the gym, take a class there.
Compliment them on their lack of fat
Contrary to popular belief, it is quite safe for people receiving chemotherapy to be around children who have had most live vaccines. The only exception would be the oral Polio vaccine, but only the IPV is used in the UK and the US.Which country are you in? The only other exception might be LAIV, but the risk if theoretical only. Ignore the anti-vaxxers who don't understand "vaccine shedding". People like Mrs A should really avoid talking about subjects they really know nothing about.
The problem with the present cancer treatment is that both chemo and radiation can trigger the growth of additional cancers. They started using Chemo in the 1930s and radiation in the 1960s and they've got to do better than this. Watch a series on YouTube called, The Truth About Cancer' and read Suzanne Somer's book, Knockout'.
Vaccines don't contain live viruses...and I'm talking about polio.. And it would not be months even if there was a massive outbreak causing the live virus to be used.
I wouldn't be concerned with labeling yourself a certain body figure
You may be a pear but as already said it's inaccurate without a pic.
Hard to tell without pictures.
Cardiac arrest means that the person has had a heart attack.
Cardiac arrest means the heart has stopped and the person is dead unless the heart is restarted within 2-3 minutes or less. Very few people survive cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest and heart attack are not the same thing. Heart attacks are the leading cause of cardiac arrest, but not all heart attacks cause the heart to stop.
Yeah
You should find a difference in your underpants only when you are in the days of your period. The remaining days therefore should Always feel dry and without discharge or a discrete secretion of glands might be minimum noticeable preferably without any blood dripping. Discharge should be reported at your doctor's screenings for STDs.
It could be arriving, or it could have just been spotting due to another cause. Definitely keep an eye on it.
most probably. it could also be seen in spotting if you got pregnant
yes it does and it could be here soon
not if you are a woman
No, no relationship between eating vegetables and growing body hair. Body hair is a genetic trait.
Nope. Though green veggies have LOTS of nice vitamins and enzymes. < M
not exactly. say that if you do not eat balanced meal, you could have lots of physical problem. you eat it and you'll be safe
Well I'm surprised you say you won't graduate apart from the spli infinitive your writing spelling and punctuation are less like the person you describe than a well educated teen making stuff up. But that's neither here nor there. Get a job. Anything to keep you solvent. Get educated. Then get a career. Sure some people have it easy but lots have a tough start. Grasp the opportunity. Thinks can get better.
We are so sorry to hear that you are contemplating suicide. Know that suicide is never the answer, no matter what problems you are struggling with. Never give up on yourself; your life has great value. It's so important that you reach out for support from a trusted adult such as a parent, aunt, uncle, school counselor, teacher, coach, or minister. We would suggest getting evaluated by a medical doctor or mental health professional, and getting involved in counseling. Please contact 911 if you need immediate assistance. It may help you to talk to a counselor at a hotline. Know that there is help out there for you and you are not alone. Counselor, MT
Do you have anxiety? I don't think so. Are you starving? I don't think so. Why commit suicide? Because you are a wimp who is so selfish that you will leave everyone that loves you behind for your own benefit. Loser. You probably want to do it for attention. You have a 4-year-old reason for wanting to commit suicide, so I'm not going to "coax you". You don't need suicide prevention help. You need serious mental help, you idiot.
I'm not going to say some BS like don't do it, while death is inevitable, you have so much to have fun with, I mean, if you are going to end it, why not **** your crush and do cocaine while stealing ****. If you ever feel like killing yourself realize that you can have some fun and that it really doesn't matter
Do your own research. the hemloch society has been as this for a long time. Dr Jack Kevorkian had his methods too.
Usually pain from kidney stones is sharp and stabbing. Your pain may or may not be from your back or a kidney infection. If nothing seems to help, please call them and let them know.
My husband gets a lot of kidney stones, and it is like no other pain ever. It is excruciating, about the only pain I could compare to the pain of childbirth.
It is the worst pain ever. At first, stomach pain. Feels a little like needing to do #2 really bad but not able. It is a "sicky pain".
Severe pain.
You're slightly Bisexual, for the most part it sounds like you lean closer to being straight, but don't worry about the thoughts just do whatever you want and date whoever you want. You can't become "more gay" if that's what you're worried about, your attractions are already preset so you'll stay the same regardless of who you look at.
Look, if a person tries hard enough they can arouse themselves with anything -- men, women, anime, animals, inanimate objects. That doesn't you gay, straight, or anything else. It simply means you are looking at all sorts of things in sexual ways. If you like women, then stick with women, but you probably really need to deal with your issues because at this point it would be difficult for a woman (or anyone else) to satisfy your sexual fantasies, which would likely cause you to be an unreliable husband.See a therapist and deal with this.
So you're bisexual! And there's nothing wrong with watching kinky porn..I'm a girl and some of the porn I watch is pretty out there, but it's all about the fantasy. Date girls, date guys, you're bound to come across someone who has the same interests as you (sexually and intuectually.) Sex is about letting go and not worrying about what anyone thinks about you. Have fun, be open to your sexuality and don't think too deeply into it...you're simply discovering yourself and your sexual preferences.
could be your appendix but here is a list of possibilities: What Are the Most Common Causes of Abdominal Pain? Whether it's a mild stomach ache, sharp pain, or stomach cramps, abdominal pain can have numerous causes. Some of the more common causes include: Indigestion Constipation Stomach virus Menstrual cramps Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) Food poisoning Food allergies Gas Lactose intolerance Ulcers Pelvic inflammatory disease Hernia Gallstones Kidney stones Endometriosis Crohn's disease Urinary tract infection Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Appendicitis
It's impossible to tell. As Pavel said, there can be many causes for abdominal pain, and many of them are nothing to be alarmed about.
it seems to me like you may be getting your period ? I usually have the same symptoms the night before I get my period ( nausea, lower back pain, cramps, etc) you'll be alright don't freak out. It could be a lot of different things girl I ain't no doctor but it's cool you good.
Prolargentsize is a fantastic product. It gives you that additional increase in the bedroom. I'll recommend it to my buddies and it functions very well. I've only taken it for 3 weeks, and it's already show results. Next time I certainly buy 2 bottles, at least!
Since I'm female, I haven't personally tried it but my husband is liking it so far. He's always thought he was too small, though I never complained. But he seems happier now with the "issue" and it's only been a couple of days. Hopefully, Prolargentsize will continue to help him feel stronger and bigger in this area.
The way the add length is by cutting two of the ligaments that hold it in place. Unless you scar badly, no one will know. It does take a while to heal. The risk is infection leading to loss of tissue. Also, you risk injury from thrusting to hard because you don't have the ligaments that stabilize it anymore.
if you want to have a reliable and result oriented sex pill for penis enlargement then prolargentsize should be your first choice.
nope
Very probably. < M
I'm going on a school tour tomorrow with all water based activities, like kayaking, sailing, canoeing, swimming, ect. But I got my preriod today. Ugh. I've already paid and it was quite expensive and I also really want to go. I've never worn pampons before I only usually use pads (I'm 13) so I don't know what to do? Is there any way I could stop my period for the day, I know it's stupid and almost impossible but still, ugh. Any suggestions what I should do??
Do nothing...continue to wear your pads, you will be fine. If you want to, wear heavy flow pads to keep you comfortable and dry. No you can't stop your period for a day, had you asked if you can get it earlier that would have been a different story.
Go get some tampons so you can get used to them before it's urgent. It's easy, you'll be fine! Have fun.
You cannot stop your period. The only thing I can suggest is to learn how to use a tampon.
No. prunes are better
A prune is a dried plum. You really ought to watch a book now and the so you know a few things about the world you live in. It's fiber that maintains regularity, not this or that food. The best fiber is wheat bran, two slices of whole wheat bread per day. Veggies with every meal do just as well. Study some books about nutrition so you know how to eat right.
How much more "regular" do you need to be? 1-2 bowel movements a day is plenty. If you're attempting to lose weight by increasing the frequency of bowel movements, you're going about weight loss all wrong.
Realistically sugar is not good for you although there are things that contain sugar which you cannot avoid. Some people drop off sugar gradually, such as in tea/coffee simply by having 1 spoon instead of 2 then once a day no sugar at all. Surpising how you adapt to sugar free drinks and food laden with sugar.
You know that he is lying. Fruits and vegetables both have sugar. Unless he's been on supplements since birth, he has been eating fruits and vegetables. NOW, he may be telling the truth that he has never had ADDED sugar, like candy, soda, processed American foods, table sugar, brown sugar, etc. I'll bet he's not fat. Some chub woll help with the Nepalese climate, but not obese.
The food available in Nepal is not the same as the food available here. He may well have never been to a place that sells sugar until he left Nepal. Of course he ate carbs of other sorts. Probably starchy root veggies and grains.
They mean, added sugar I guess, you can take natural sugar from fruit and honey
Stay away from bad sugars only
Because he hasn't eaten sugar (he probably means processed sugar). Not that hard.
you eat fruits , and honey, there is natural sugar in fruits. But sugar is not necessary for the body.
he hasn't eaten sugar
no clue.
I agree- if she is breathing normally, the wrapper will probably be fine for her body to take care of. Any sign of choking, wheezing or irregular breathing could mean her airway is blocked. Keep an eye on her colouring- lips turning blue is a sign of lack of oxygen. If you see this, call 911. If you are worried, you could always call the nurses help line. which is 811 (if you are in BC).
A little won't do harm - you may want to unwrap them in the future and you can swallow the wrapper
She should be fine but if she gets a stomach ache or has trouble breathing call 911 or take her to the ER.
See a Doctor...
it should pass through but if she's choking,getting stomach aches or weird stomach feelings id take her to the doctor
We have been bombed here in Britain for years. Have you never heard of the IRA? Bombs in London, Manchester, Warrington, Guildford, Birmingham, Aldershot, to name just a few. Even on a bus on the M62. Our security services have been dealing with this stuff for decades. Stop worrying and let him have a life.
Yes it is as safe as anywhere. London has had many years experience due to domestic terrorism from Ireland. He is probably at a much higher risk travelling there. No where is 100% safe.
London is more secure than Area 51.
Grow up you silly child
You have an exaggerated view of the risk. It is minuscule.
Not really no. ISIS will probably get him.
They're farm girls. What do you think? . .
It's a sin for them to know what an uncircumcised penis looks like so they have seen only circumcised ones.
Do Amish men (boys) know how does vagina look like? healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
A lot of of Amish have large family,s , so they must do it in the dark .
Probably, lots of kids and the girls help take care of the smaller kids, including younger boys.
Only the naughty ones
im sure they lick them them like lollipops
I remember reading somewhere that if you squeeze just underneath the head of your penis gently then gently pull your penis away from you every day for a few months it can make it grow up to one inch more. My penis is 5" when flacid an since I've been doing this it's just under 6" when flacid.
Do you believe in Santa Claus? Do you believe in the tooth fairy? You must if you believe that there is such a thing penis enlargement. LMAO there is no such thing as a pill, cream, potion or exercise that will magically make the penis just grow.
Prolargentsize is a fantastic product. It gives you that additional increase in the bedroom. I'll recommend it to my buddies and it functions very well. I've only taken it for 3 weeks, and it's already show results. Next time I certainly buy 2 bottles, at least!
Your penis size is genetically determined and there are no pills, devices, etc that can permanently and safely enlarge it.
No, theres no way. All of those ads are false. NOTHING can enlarge your penis. It should grow on its own. It has been proven.
They have also helped me stay playing with the girls for a longer period. I have understood from my previous experiences that if a guy finishes off quickly, the girl never gets satisfied and still needs something more. Prolargentsize has helped me end that desire and completely exhaust a girl to her end.
None are effective, all a waste of money.

Sex.
Possibly. I used to be an avid junk food eater since I was a kid, and got breast cancer at the age of 43....you never know what you are eating.
Only certain junk foods can cause cancer, not all of them.
Not happening in Reality.. U got bigger challenges than food dies. U got better chance of death driving to school/work Daily.

No. The guy who said it in the first place withdrew his statement. He had no scientific proof to support his so called findings. There is some evidence that autism is liked to the fathers age. The older the father is the more likely that he'll have an increased chance to make an autistic kid. Look at how many people get a vaccine each year and if vaccine can side autism then wouldn't there be more autistic people. If someone bothers to look at the number of vaccines each year vs the number of autism diagnosed each year there's no link.
There's no scientific evidence that supports vaccines causing autism. There is, however, evidence that suggests that vaccines will greatly reduce the risk of an autistic child getting ill from diseases such as measles, mumps, and rubella.
No. Autism is caused by an extra chromosome. Vaccines can't give you an extra chromosome.
No. But retardation does cause the belief that vaccines cause autism.
I don't know if I believe that but I think it's a possibility. I've never really read an article about it. I do believe that the drugs we take are what's caused are bodies to become weak and prone to disease.
No, there are no links between vaccines and Autism whatsoever. Autism is based on genetics and heredity.
No, its a myth. It doesn't actually cause an individual to become autistic
what is the 1/2 time
Do you not have any friends... Any kind of social life? Masturbating once a day is normal. And sometimes even twice a day. But 3 to 5 times a day indicates you have issues bro. Testicle pain is going to be the least of your worries.
3 to 5 times per day is not a health risk. the problem is elsewhere. you probably dont eat enough healthy food and you probably drink soda drinks and eat junk. drink more water, eat more vegetables and fruit. (reduce the drugs or alcohol, if you do this). you will find your condition clears up. BUT,,, i agree with the "Anonymou" guy. 5 times a day indicates you have issues bro. Testicle pain is going to be the least of your worries. ie: find another outlet, rather tthan a sexual one. sex and masturbating is fine, but it should NOT take over your life.
You should only masturbate once or twice a day.
Just do it once or twice a day and see if that helps.
I know you said that you're not ready, but I still think you should talk to someone so that this is less likely to happen in the future. Talking can help. If anything, please at least call a hotline if you ever feel this way again. Keeping it in is only going to bottle it up and make it harder. Getting help is hard and takes courage, but you just gotta do it. I wish you the best.
I started playing video games and watching anime. Both make life much more bearable.
I have seen your "Update" and I am happy to note that you do not feel that you need any help. All is well that ends well.
Seeing your question is why I am so opposed to contact lenses. Sadly it's not really as much about the damage that contact lenses can cause but more about how people don't understand how critical it is to treat their lens like they need to be treated. trying to use the wrong things to clean your lenses and not keeping your lens holder changed quite often and of course over wearing of the lenses. Ally if you can't keep up with the proper cleaning solutions you probably need to stop wearing contacts and go back to wearing glasses. At least wearing glasses you can't do any harm to your eyes and you can wear them as much as you wish.
No, certainly not ! They will absorb the drugs in those drops then hold them against your corneas after causing some serious reaction. Once they have absorbed a liquid, it can't be removed. There ARE no redness relief drops for use with contacts to begin with.
No, not if they are soft lenses. If they are the old type hard plastic lenses (rigid) then they can be soaked in water, even.
NO! Most likely they will cloud the lenses.
no - that would ruin the lenses
Pysch meds sometimes need the dosage tweaked. It would be better to keep taking it, and discuss this with the doctor who prescribed them. The doctor will tell you whether and how much to change your medication. Meanwhile, now that you've been made aware, pay attention to how you talk to your friends.
Considering that according to science, it is more of a placebo then anything else, your being cocky,is becouse you are an ***.
St. John's Wort is ineffective. I doubt it's causing your problem.
Most men circumcised as adults have doubts about it for the first few days or weeks as initially the penis looks very bruised swollen and generally unpleasant. However, once healing has progressed a bit and the stitches are all out it looks and feels much better. Once fully healed (6-8 weeks on average) you will be liking your new penis ver much as both hygiene and sex will be greatly improved.
Relax. Circumcision was routine for all babies, regardless of religion, in the USA from at least 1920 until just recently. The "whole" movement has made it less than routine, but 90% of American males are circumcised.
It doenst look yuck. Its in the process of healing. But after that your penis will look more attractive and cleaner and more manly. Circumcised or not, sensitivity is just the same.
see a doctor and discuss it with him
p
It's stand as PMO (Porn Masturbating Orgasm). I'm doing none of those. Does I must restart if edging without PMO? Many nofappers say edging lead to PMO. But it is only probability. In fact, I'm on day 28 with still watching porn from day 1 to day 10, but never masturbate and orgasm once, until going through day 28.
don't know about that , but edging really works , with or without porn .the longest I have gone , is 9 days
Why would you not masturbate? This No Fap stuff just sounds really bizarre. Enjoy your body, don't neglect it.
Get A LIFE
Well no fap generally means that you won't orgasm or masturbate however masturbation without orgasm is torture in my book.
Interesting. If I went into a restroom and saw a fan blowing at the urinal, I'd probably avoid it and use a stall to pee. Not sure if its unsanitary, though. It would help with air circulation. Maybe they did some maintenance on the urinal, like caulked around the edges or repaired damage or even painted or repaired the wall it sits on and it needed to dry? I don't think it would necessarily blow anything harmful out unless it was really strong. Probably ok, but I would not stand near it just the same.
Might tickle your penis when taking a whizz. But not sure why it would be unsanitary. Might evaporate more urine-contaminated water but that water would evaporate some regardless.
Not sure how that is even remotely considered a men's health issue or concern
why would that matter?
You should have licked it up before you sat down.
You should be fine, you're not likely to get any thing from urine or toilet seats.
Most likely, yes you will be fine.
never hurt you
Hi, So I bought my first sex toy (dildo) online and when it arrived and I opened it, it smelled potent and felt oily. I washed it but the odour is still there. It's made of latex jelly and after a quick google search i realised these can be toxic and cause health problems. So now I need another type thats safe because I don't want to use it, can someone recommend one? Also I'm a 17 year old virgin and am still tight despite being fingered. But I want to stretch myself because my boyfriend is huge so I'd prefer < 6 inches to start with (he's 9).
The smell and feel of the rubbery dildos is just natural, a problem with the material. Nothing really wrong.
Just cover it with a condom. You can buy some toys made with medical-grade plastic like the Lielo. But they are $50 or more. Try a Hitichi magic wand.
They found an ancient one made out of stone...do not ask me what archeologist identified it as such a weapon but SHE made the most sense with her assumption. It is a 9 inch number. I could not find the site again if I tried but it was on YouTube.
not sure what potent smell is.......use a condom on the dildo for safety
Can you please friend me on FB, Joey Yambor, Akron Ohio...
You should not attempt to cut yourself anywhere as you may bleed to death or develop severe infection. If you would prefer not to have a foreskin then see a urologist who can safely circumcise you under local anaesthetic
Neither! You should not harm yourself, nor should you end your life! Perhaps you could tell us what is wrong, so that we can be of more help? You aren't alone, and there are many here who would be glad to help you I am sure!
Tell us what's wrong I for one wanna help don't do anything you'll regret PLZ tell us what's wrong NOW
Um... WHAT? NO don't end it all! There's so much more to live for. Don't make a permanent choice for a temporary reason!
Wtf
Well the question you linked to is not the best type of question to ask here as no one can honestly tell you what is wrong. It is a question that a Doctor should answer not people on here who will answer it anyway just to get 2 points. You are lucky you have no answers to that one so you haven't been given any advice that may be harmful if you believe it.

I am a 16 year old male and I am very worried. I used to have many hard erections daily and I never had any issues, but for the past 2 months, they have gone away. If I try to produce an erection, it will get straight, then quickly go away, and it will also sometimes be soft and pointing down. I'm very worried for my future and I'm embarrassed to talk to my parents. I used to masturbate about 4 times daily, if that helps. I try not to anymore because I heard that might be causing it. Please help.
Cut down, give it a rest, & follow a healthy diet & lifestyle from this point on.
Started to take as needed basis , worked great. The I found myself wanting the extra energy and now I take Prolargent 5x5 Extreme daily. If taken before action it is best to take it a few hours before so you get the full benefit. If taken daily I have experience everything works real good and I stay hard long after any action.
The "green" in your vomit is nothing more than stomach bile, that's all. You've thrown up everything you had in your stomach, and now you're throwing up stomach bile. The only thing you can do is just continue to feel miserable until you finally sober up and all the alcohol is out of your system.
Eat salty, bland food (crackers, pretzels, chicken broth, etc) to replace electrolytes and drink fluids that don't contain caffeine. If you haven't urinated for the past 12 hours and if you are still having trouble holding things down, you may need to go to an ER for an IV. The green is bile - its not a big deal.
Avoid milk as it will curdle in your stomach, drink plenty water as you are dehydrated, the green in the vomit is the bile from your stomach
Drink a lot of milk and also rehydrate with water, topped off by a lot of sleep :)
Quit drinking, you twit !!!
Medium brown.
Brown kinda. Same as my hair like but my hair is so beautiful in the sun so so are my pubes.
Purple
What pubes?
Purple, like a teletubby.
brown
It's a normal thing. Had a girlfriend years back loved it. That was one of her favorite ways or "stimulating" herself. They are a sensitive part of the body and truth be told, Some guys even like theirs being played with.
Nope, not when I do it. I only get aroused when someone else does it.
What a coincidence. Whenever you rub your nipples and get horny and start watching porn, I get horny and start watching porn, too.
Im trying to and I get a bit twitchy but i have to do other stuff :/
Of course.
Nope. Guess my nips are not that sensitive.
I had a no-scalpel vasectomy performed on Friday the 6th at 2:00pm. The procedure took about 30 minutes. After the procedure was over, my scrotum began to ache just a little, but it wasn't really that bad. It just felt a little discomfort, but nothing serious at all. Later during the evening, my scrotum began to feel just fine and the next day, I was back to normal. I can still see the two tiny incisions the doctor made, but it's becoming more and more unnoticeable as they heal. I'm really surprised of how fast I recovered. I was under the impression that I'll be in pain for about a week. Is this normal?
Not entirely normal to heal that fast but definitely possible (obviously). Consider yourself lucky - but don't be surprised if you do experience a little more discomfort in the next few days. It's normal too.
my dr told me to bring sperm samples in after 19 orgasms.....one week later i took the tenth in and got the word i was shooting blanks
She should see a doctor because she probably has an infection and needs antibiotics. but keeping clean is probably the best thing she can do at home. If she's not going to take a shower, she should at least wash her private area and change underwear daily. This will also help her not get infections in the future. I use 3 washcloths for this and stand in the tub- one soapy, one for rinsing and one for drying. Also, eating healthy and drinking plenty of fluids always helps your immune system deal with whatever's going on.
Kind of sounds like a yeast infection.. it'll feel like paper cuts and white stuff comes out with it. She definitely needs to go to a Dr and just explain her symptoms..
She needs to see a doctor sounds like she has an infection of some sort but these can be dangerous if left untreated.
Please let your mom or dad know about the situation and that she needs to talk with a board-certified ob/gyn for further evaluation.
My husband sprained his ankle by falling down the steps.
Rock climbing, or dropping a sheet of plywood on your foot vertically (I did that, tennis shoes do not protect your toes, and broken toes don't get splints).
Why not go all the way and break your ankle. A hammer should do the trick.

That's not schizophrenia. That's an anxiety disorder. It's time to see your doctor about the anxiety.
Schizophrenics have little insight about what they're doing. You're just thinking too much about it which will believe you have it but if you don't overthink and you're still having those problems then you should get diagnosed.
Yes, sir. Most 23 year-old Indians would find it acceptable to have that in them. Although, Indians from India are too cheap to pay for it without a discount. Worldwide average is 5.5". That's above average, especially for India. M joking. India is 4". A sense of humor is better than another inch when you are that far above the average. You're not a Comanche, are you?
At first, I thought the product wasn't working , but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results . It's been a little over a week , and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
That's well above average for an Indian.
Good for any guy- well above average adult size, top 10% in fact in length and girth. Well hung.
Yes, your penis size of 6.5 inches is great for anyone.
Obviously you are a West Coast Indian. < M
this silly immature question is usually asked by 12 year old boys
so what if people tell you NO its completely useless lump of meat that wouldn't be any good for anything other than peeing with.. what you gonna do about it?..
it is good for peeing
At 5'7", sure not. But, should you want to play around & find-out what FAT would feel like, put a 10# ankle weight on EACH foot & walk around for a day. Good way to build your legs & make-sure you don't slip into bad eating habits.... And good for a laugh !!!
Nope
So instead of going to a doctor you decided ask a random website a questions about your health. You are unbelievable smart
No. You are not fat at all. You are in the lower weight bracket for your height.
Not fat. Just fine.
your fat like everyone else that asks stupid questions
I should probably mention that I am male.
no you're not
No dear...you will be completely fine. I have had anesthesia many times (6 under general, and 10 under twilight) and I am in very poor health. Guess what, I am still alive!
The risk is so small, we're talk about literally 1in a million odds that anything bad will happen, these are trained professionals, whom took years of medical school They will take good care of you and everything will be fine
The anesthesiologist will be there to monitor your vital signs at all times. He'll take good care of you. Worrying about something you can't control is pointless.
If it didn't kill the thousand of people before you you will be fine I'd b more worried about getting cut open
99% of the time it just puts you out to sleep for a few hours. The other 1% they know what to do if you have a bad reaction. They are all set for that possibility. No worries .
My mum had to have that because she had a heart problem. Her health was very bad at that point. Her rythms were off and if she was bleeding BAD she would die... she is now healthy and doing better. :) The risk is very small! Good luck
Stay awake then.
So you know the cause yet you don't know how to stop the effect. Curious!
stop taking it
Maybe adding crack to your daily routine would help.....
Stop doing meth.
So, Dan....how often do you get people to do this to you and why can't you stop seeking these people out to abuse you?
because it's fun.
it doesn't
Why? You're at a perfectly normal weight, just saying. Here are some ways you can lose weight and not muscle. 1.Eat Enough Protein. ... 2.Maintain Strength/Intensity/Weight On The Bar. ... 3.Reduce Weight Training Volume and/or Frequency. ... 4.Get Pre & Post Workout Nutrition Right… ... 5.Don't Reduce Calories By TOO Much. ... 6.Incorporate Calorie/Carb/Nutrient Cycling. ... 7.Take Diet Breaks When Needed. ... 8.Avoid Excessive Amounts Of Cardio (Or Just Don't Do ANY At All)
Why would you loose muscle if you are continuing to work out in a progressive weight resistance program? What is your present percentage of body fat and do you actually have 30 lbs of fat to lose?
I really needed to lose Weight I’m approaching my 32th birthday and I have noticed thats its getting harder and harder to lose Weight. I was desperate because I could no longer fit into my cute clothes and fat pants are just not for me! I just started “ Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea ” Tea its only been two weeks and already five pounds down and it tastes great!!! Thanks Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea .
Don't only do cardio. Mix it up from day to day.

You are really not much overweight. Maybe 15 to 20 pounds at most. So that is not a lot and would not be very visible.
I can't see the picture but, based on your BMI, you're barely overweight. A normal BMI is up to 24.9 and yours is 25. You literally need to lose one pound to be within the norm. One pound can be gained or lost very easily. So don't stress!
you're good...i don't know what's going on with your doctor. either he isn't very good at being a doctor or you misunderstood what he said...go back and clarify he was probably trying to say something that didn't come off right, because you surely aren't fat
Ur not fat. though ur not super skinny... As long as ur eating healthy things ur totally fine. :)) but when I see ur body I don't think fat.. I think normal sized!! Xxoo
I need to see more to really know
not really.
Hefty 13 gallon trash bags and a zip tie.
Good luck with never having sex with a woman ain't no woman gone let u stick that in her
dont worry about condoms because no woman will ever let you near here with a lump of meat like that
Well I think a regular should do the trick. You could stretch it over your head if you wanted to so it should stretch over your dong with no trouble..
grow up and stop posting rubbish
There are magnums.
My 13 year old daughter complained off an on for two days last week that her upper right hip was hurting when she would walk. She ended up walking with a limp for a little bit on one of the days. Then it went away and she didn t have any more trouble. Yesterday her shin on the right side hurt her a lot for a few minutes. She has an apt this afternoon but I m panicking and worried that it s something serious.
I have similar pain and was at specialist the other day and it is something to do with the muscle on my foot, think it was plantar fisilitis, I have to get casts of my feet done for special insoles for shoes - bone cancer pain wont come and go, Good Luck
Bone cancer usually appears in one place and stays there.
Unlikely
Obviously we have no idea what's wrong, if anything. This isn't a good place to ask questions like this. Do your best NOT to communicate your panic to your child.
Well, you're pretty crazy to panic so much. Take her to the doctor.
go see a haematology doctor, no one here will be able to accurately diagnose your child.
I want to be able to pleasure her but lately she has been complaining that my dick is too big and she feels it going into her stomach... I am well endowed and am very happy that my penis is long, but i don t want to dumb down making love to her and I also don t want it to be a painful experience to her. I love her and I truly hope my dick size is not going to be a burden on our relationship. I m about 8.5-9 in, early 20s white. She s Asian early 20s, and like 5 6.
8-1/2 inches!! That's not normal! I imagine it does feel like it is going into her stomach, considering that the average woman's vagina is only a little more than 4 inches in length. What are you - a human or a stallion? You could cut off about 2 inches and then you would be about the right length! I'm afraid you are going to have trouble keeping girl friends all your life. A long penis is not necessarily a "good" thing for a man to have. Perhaps you have a future as a porn actor.
Folks, really?! It's obviously because she isn't used to having sex. Or the problem is you aren't having enough foreplay which allows her to get aroused and ready for action. The vagina can most certainly fit more than a 9" penis, it is NOT only 4 inches!! It relaxes itself when getting aroused, so that helps too! A 9" penis is perfectly okay. I think that's about a perfect length personally.
I wish my penis were big. It's small at only 5 inches.
Genitals are not correlated to height. Just bad luck. Your size is ok. 2 options: find a new g/f or use lots of lube, take it slow and watch her reaction... Adjust. Nothing else will help. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Try using a bit more lube and not putting it in all the way. Also, try and go slow until she gets used to what you have in already before asking her if she's ready for more
i honestly dont think any dick would be too big for a vagina to even make it hurt because the vaguna streches out! imagine having a baby yeah thats how much a vagina can strech out! i think ur girlfriend is probabky not used to having sex. its takes experience for it to not hurt ! thats how i was when i first started having sex!

a real woman arouses to push her donut all the way down on her man but that gal isnt woman enough to. break up with her, shouldnt be a problem since she is "gf" but not the wife.
That's within the normal range. 98.6 is only an average. Some people are over 100F all the time. I'm usually low 97s.
Quit playing with your anal digital thermometer or you'll wear it out!
Not weird at all
possibly not unusual. Is your thermometer accurately calibrated? did you measure the skin, under tongue, armpit, ear or somewhere else? - all vary
Hi yes in farenheit it will be if you have been sweating.
It can't come randomly - that's a fact. BUT, there are a lot of people that can go through things without anyone knowing. Boredom or stress. Poor health, that includes mental, physical, sexual and social. Abuse; light drinking or smoking can count if it's done in a abusive way(i.e. drinking because your bored or stressed). These and so many more factors can cause depression seemingly out of nowhere.
Absolutely. That's what makes the difference between situational depression and clinical (mental illness) depression.
Yeah, it's a mental illness so it can come randomly or be triggered.
Yes. Although people often say "I'm depressed" when things are bad, depression frequently strikes people who are not stuck in a bad situation. Please help your relative gather the strength to see a medical doctor about this.
In order to know this basic information, you should try to update the knowledge and expertise about that person's health conditions periodically. By the way who is that "PERSON".
Technically healthy depending on your age. Teens need 8-12 hours a sleep a day sooo
Unhealthy
Healthy
Well. It depends on if you are really getting those twelve hours. Wearing a Fitbit, I've learned that my diet effects my sleep activity. Heavy booze drinking and eating tons of salty stuff without drinking 3 gallons of water, my sleep activity is very minimal at times. As such, it's best to be sure your dieting skills are on par to earn those 12 hours and check your sleep activity. Sometimes it's 100%, sometimes it's 60% and you find out you're not really earning 12 hours. You're earning up to 6 hours a night if you have poor dieting that day.
Too hard to say without more information. When I left my ex I remember being so exhausted from sleep deprivation that I slept 12 hours per day for around 2 months. I normally like 8+ hours.
I wish I could sleep 12 hours!
Healthy because cats usually sleep 16hrs
Unhealthy, if you take so much sleep then you should see a doctor. If your body needs so much time to regain energy, it could be an early stage of cancer.
They don't have one. They're still trying to figure out how to make the best of this nightmare scenario. .
Trump is a world famous real estate developer. Name something that either Democrat candidate has ever done that was useful.
Even a "gold plated turd" is way better than what we have now. Or the traitor Hillary.
I would imagine to find many things funny that is when you not yelling and cussing at buses when they pass
Ted Cruz is my nominee.
Imbeciles find anything "funny."
meet her and give your time and try to chill up her.tell her about life,it's very beautiful ,peaceful and loving.talk about her stress, and feelings which she keeps herself and sad.remind herself about strength and power which she have.give her some hope and make her lough by talking about something funny.take her on some natural quite place which is free from all crowd so, she will feel easy to express her feelings....
At any age. I was circumcised when I was 19 years old and recently my son was circumcised at 4 days old. FYI I can tell you from personal experience that it's a lot nicer being circumcised and definitely has no negative effect. Which is why I had my son done so he wouldn't have to deal with all the problems I did being uncircumcised.
There is no upper rot lower age limit for getting circumcised. Whatever the age an appropriate anaesthetic (usually a local injection) will be used, with a mild sedative added where necessary. If you are below the age of medical consent for your country/state (usually 18 or 16) then you will need parental consent to get circumcised. Once you have decided that yu want to be circumcised then the sooner you go and get it done the better as you will have longer to enjoy its proven health and sexual benefits.
It can be done at any age. However, if you're under 18 you will need your parents consent, if you are 18+ you can have it done whenever you're ready to do it.
Usually done as a newborn or shortly after birth for religious or other reasons. Otherwise, it is safer after the child reaches one year of age and can undergo the procedure under anesthesia. There is no medical reason for this except in cases of severe infection or disease (cancer of the foreskin or penis.
No age requirement to get circumcised. I was 15 when i was circumsized, others being circumcized lower/higher than my age.
Jewish boys get it done a few days or so after they are born so there is no age limit but unless it is for religous reasons your surgeon will only do it if you have problems on your penis
i was a newborn
Your penis of 3 inches is normal for your age.
you are 13!
Yes. < M
you still growing. so, don´t worry
It sounds as if you might be a person who eats before you go to bed? You might want to change that practice. But most likely the feelings you are having are hunger. When you wake up in the morning you have actually been fasting for 8 hours or so.
LOL...Your stomach does not rumble....the sounds you hear is food being processed through your intestines. Any pain that may coincide with these sounds is, more than likely gas produced by the bacteria processing the food.
It is yelling out for food. YOU may not be hungry, but your STOMACH is.
digestive problems. do you eat late or eat food that is unhealthy for the majority of meals?
Figure out how much fat you want per day and get it all for the first meal. Fat slows digestion so you have a steady supply of energy all day and you don't get hungry between meals. Ham and cheese is a good combination.
Yes, it is a good thing to eat for breakfast. Lots of protein. Add a slice of whole grain toast and it will be even better.
I think this would be excellent. Cheese makes me feel very alert for some reason. Also bananas are excellent for a number of reasons too, they help concentration, & calm your nerves! Hope this helps.
Yes
Yes, but a better alternative would be turkey, it's much healthier
It's good to eat any day of the week !! Even for lunch !!
Yes of course. It has protein, and dairy and will keep you awake and energized for your test.
Heck yeah that's fine.
yeah that's not possible
Don't expect it.
That's not how it works.
No your eyes will not change colour, they will be dark brown all your life .
Okay , so dont yell at me or anything but i was wondering if i could grow taller, im currently 5'10 and my parents are 5'2 and 5'8 i wanna be atleast 6'0 one of my cousins is near 6'1 and both his parents are under 5'7 ( 5'7 and 5'6 ) my other cousin is 5'11 and his parents are 5'7 and 5'3 they are currently the tallest in the family i started growing around 14 im 16 atm can i reach 6 foot ? from 14 to 16 ive grown 7inches or maybe a little bit more
No. Men stop round 16. It's widely believed wrongly that they grow at older ages but that's very rare indeed. Your growth plates are closed. Don't get scammed by frauds selling snake oil remedies. None of the things you mention have any effect on height.
No way to tell, just depends on which height genes you got that are dominant. Don't set a goal of a certain height, since you have zero control over how tall you will be.
also during my growth spurt i didnt exactly had the best habits i was playing sports ( barely ) but i slept around 5 hours a night and barely drank milk ( lasted almost a year or 2 ) i didnt really care about my height back then and i wasnt even aware of my conditions and how it would affect me sooner , so can i still have that potential height inside me ? i feel i stunted my own growth .
If I went with my dreams I would be having a great sex life and winning the lotto - I am nearly 60 years old a dont buy a lotto ticket so how can my dream mean anything, just over imagination, lol
Imagination
Does a dream mean anything in relation to prediction of the future. No.
Nope. It means nothing. It's just a dream.
I had a dream that I could fly; but when I woke up I discovered it was just a dream.
No. It means you have an over active imagination.
No.
Cigars
cherries are apparently quite effective. i've heard of people eating even cherry pie filling (wouldn't recommend it) and got relief. actual cherry juice would probably be the best choice.
That is funny do you even know what gout is??
Are you overweight? It's harder to regulate your body heat when you are overweight.
I have the same exact problem. Doctors couldn t find anything wrong with me though.
--->> Tips---> https://tr.im/greencolour1link
Fasting is quite good for you. People think you'll drop dead if you aren't eating constantly, but you can go comfortably for 10 or 15 days without food. Drink lots of water though. Dr. Furhman - in his "Fasting" book - regularly fasts people for 21 days. It's not for teenagers though - they do need their food. It's nice to finally get empty especially after pigging out on garbage. Just a tip..... use the time you have NOT eating to figure out what JUNK is and what to avoid.
You get a little faint and you can't focus on things very well. Sometimes you can get a little annoyed by very small things. It's one way to start a diet - fast the first day, then start eating about 4 healthy meals a day.
You'll make it more likely that you'll binge again at some point in the future. People binge when they don't eat enough.
You'd be fine, but it's not recommended. Even if you just binged, still eat. Just go easy and keep it nutritious. Your body needs fuel regularly,even if you over-fueled the day before.
don't be like me and i do that you end up getting low blood sugar everyday which isn't something you want don't be like me with the not enough fluids you need both
Nothing... but you're also not doing anything by not eating. There really is no such thing as detoxifying your body or tricking it, so it's kind of pointless to starve yourself.
You may lose some energy, just make sure to drink water!
You will get hungry and probably binge again
not much... just hunger pains
I've always measured from the underside where it meets the body to the tip, with the guys having a full erection of course. Measuring from the underside is just as accurate and if the guy has a huge upward curve like a banana like a couple of my boyfriends have had, it makes it a lot easier.
Actually you penetrate the vagina and if not too long, your pubic bone will push up against hers- will be skin of course between but not much. But measure is along the top and with the ruler pushed back against the bone-still will have the skin/fat pad there. So good approximation of how deep you can go.
Retard. Do you measure the height of a tree from the leaves all the way down to the roots in the ground? No. Point A to point B... Only what is visible outside the body smart one. What is inside the body or covered with pubic fat does not count. SMH
Dont add pressure to your skin to make it more lenghty, measure it from the tip of the head to the base, just the base and not the inside of it...
many on here take a wild guess
from the base too the tip
Hi there , you should never stop taking antidepressants without consulting your gp. Your symptoms will often come back as what people tend to do is get better due to being on the meds, think there ok then then stop ! I would go back on them gradually building yourself back up and remain well for a good 12 months then think about reducing your dosage if you wish. There's nothing wrong with taking one tablet a day . You will get there , lots of love xxx
Antidepressants dont always work all the time. They will lesson the amount of depression you feel, but you will always have bad days. But there are people out there that can help you. I for one and still on antidepressants and i know what you're going through. I am here if you need :)
In order for antidepressants to really do their job you have to take them for a year minimum. If you stop before a year then youre likely to have your depression relapse. If you have been taking them for a year and stopped, and are still feeling this way then you likely need to be on them for longer. Please speak to your Dr to see what might be the best course of action to take.
yes, there are always side effects when you suddenly stop your medication. Talk to your r; maybe he would be able to wean you off them or give you a weaker dose ------------ \ But actually depression is due to your brain not producing sufficient serotonin. So obviously you need to stay on meds in order to function properly. I've been on Zoloft for 20 yrs and feel great. I wouldn't stop for anything.
Of course it's normal. Medications do not cure depression or other mental illnesses, they only cover it up, so once you go off them, your are likely going to be back at square one. This is why therapy is the best option for mental illnesses that are not life threatening.
Meds have a half life, meaning they stay in your system for a very long time. It takes 2-3 months for medication to be completely out of your system, do typically symptoms may reappear around that time.
i would say it was normal---please tell me you tapered off ? your body doesn't process serotonin well when on pills--I mean the pill kind of gets things going and your body just gets lazy--so it needs time to adjust to lower anti-ds. also-did you get therapy and learn coping skills while you were taking medication? if not, why would you be in a better place when off the meds? you'd be right back where you started,,,,unless the whole episode was situational, and the situation is now resolved. so--if you didn't taper-or want to try something natural-try 5htp,
There is no "normal" when it comes to depression. Depression is not a normal state. In your case, we cannot diagnose your particular brain chemistry because no one diagnose you over the internet.
you shouldn't have stopped taking your anti depressants because it makes the depression worser when it comes back and i can you from my experience i haven't taken mine for like a day and i get really depressed and then the doctor tells you take it unless they tell you to stop taking it okie! :) i hope this helped
.
There are many online help sources, one is Kids Helpline although I don't know what countries thats available in. If you just type a few words into Google you should have a lot of help at your fingertips. I really hope you don't kill yourself, even if I have no connection to you other than responding to your post. All the best, good luck, I hope things don't get too bad. Lots of love xx
If you have fantasies or mental images about hurting yourself or have other suicidal thoughts, get help right away by taking one of these actions: Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Call a suicide hotline number. In the US you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 to reach a trained counselor. If you need other options you can always type "suicide hotline number" into your favorite search engine for more local options. You can also visit the nearest Emergency room or Urgent Care facility. You could even talk to someone from your faith community or a school counselor.
Call the suicide hotline. If you're being abused, tell someone. If you don't wanna live with your mom anymore, tell someone. Suicide takes away the chance of life getting better. Whe. Yor old enough, you can be on your own, get a boyfriend or girlfriend, get an apartment, and have a good life.
Have hou tried online support groups or online hotlines u can Msg with someone who understands and wanta to help you or even suicide hotlines you can talk over the phone to someone who can help you there are many of ways to get help that doesn't involve your mom or parents. And search support groups in your town. I'm not sure how old u are but still in School talk to a favorite teach or guidance counselor

If you feel you don't have anyone to talk to you, can ring Lifeline at 13 11 14. Trust me, it will help. Just remember, you are worth living and you are loved. I love you.
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Try talking to another trusted adult. call a suicide hotline, there is at least one for every country, and they will always pick up. they listen to you. they don't force anything on you. they don't call the law. they try to help. if you have any friends, talk to one you trust. do you have any siblings? maybe they could help. maybe try talking to your mom again, sit her down, and tell her that your problem is very serious. tell her you need help. please don't take this situation lightly, if you have absoulutly no one, or feel like you do, at least call a helpline. I beg you.
If to strong yes
If they haev the wrong prescription lenses, yes
Only if they put the wrong prescription in them.
Not normally if the prescription and fit of the frames are good.
ummm... It is not good that you are listening to people... I am called fat and I don't really care.. I exercise a lot and have a good diet... So first of all, you should take what people say seriously... I really depends on how fast you lost weight. If you lost weight very quickly, it means you did something wrong... It also depends on what you did to lose weight. If you exercised a lot and had a healthy diet consisting of vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, etc, you should be ok. If you took pills or skipped meals, it is not so good. So, you should give a bit more information so that the question can be answered properly....
No, it's bad if you can see them really easily though.
It depends on how fast you lost weight, and how you did it. Consult a dietician. She can help you.
Can you "see" them. Check this chart: https://www.rush.edu/health-wellness/qui...
no
Since "Jackie m" is a type 2 diabetic she probably knows best how to keep the sugar levels up with frequent eating. As you are eating every 2 hours you can rest assured you will also be keeping your sugar levels up all day long. For people that only eat 3 times a day they only get 3 spikes in blood sugar levels following each meal then it fall's back to it's usual low level. But for you, it's about 15 or 16 spikes, or nearly all day long it's going up and down.
Yes, it is totally fine to eat every two hours if you are okay with that and it works for you.
Yes it is ok and I have to do it as I am type 2 diabetic and it keeps the sugar levels normal and I have lost 28lbs, I also done exercise.
as long as its a balanced diet, and you're doing exercise, I see nothing wrong with it. it's probably better for you to eat meals a day, with few snacks in between, but I don't think your way would be "harmful". you should probably look into it more tho, im not exactly a professional!
No it isn't. It takes 4 hours to fully digest a meal, no matter how small it is.
Yes I think that's good
AS long as the total amount you eat is correct it matters much less how you divide it up.
Yeah, sure is. As long as you aren't eating too many calories.
than do it if it makes you happy
no

Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
I know what you are going through.... let me guess, furstrated, helpless,dont want to even go out in public and tried of people staring. I went through it for years. I tried almost every thing that came out. After summing it up ive could have bought a brand new honda... I was blessed with my new neighbor. She is a dermitoligist, she turn me on to bevoline... Amazing results and not expensive at all. Make sure you get the one that comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine... there are immitation out there. Hope i help
That's caused from using tissues alot and they will go away after you stop blowing your nose repeataly
Normal. Average... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Your penis at 6 inches is a lot bigger than average for your age. You have nothing to worry about regarding the size of your penis.
Well that's a very good size both flaccid and erect. Your a bit on the large/average side.
Asking questions about penis size is the average thing for people to do on YA.
No. Unfortunately that is rather big for 14. Or indeed 15. < M
Above average, believe it or not. Ppl gotta stop comparing with p0rn.
near top of range in adult flaccid size, and an inch above adult average erect size so no, you are not average at all.
BTW I'm 14 almost 15
NO ONE should drive for 6 hours straight, regardless of age! Regular breaks are important. You should make a point to stop every couple of hours.
My grandpa did it several times a week until he retired at age 90. Had a perfect driving record.
If the man is still in good health, sure- but need to stop and walk around every couple of hours to make sure circulation is good in the legs- and of course to pee.
everyone is different - why would you drive that far with no breaks at any age?
Assuming they are healthy and competent yes.
one out of a hundred
The healthier ones, yes.
Well, the way it works is you go to the ER, and get evaluated. If you pass (fail?) you'd go to a mental hospital (if possible) and if you don't, then you'd go on suicide watch. From my experience I've had them call my house twice every day to make sure I'm alright and don't want to/haven't hurt myself. It does show up on your permanent record, but it's best to be safe. Usually it only conflicts with jobs where you have high trauma rates and guns (mostly the military/police).
Pleas contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org... they have a chat line or you can call at 1-800-273-8255 Someone is always available to talk with you and help you through your situation. They have resources that they can give you to get help in your area...(where ever you call from)...and you can still stay anonymous if you wish.
Suicide watch where???
I dont know what would happen but it will stay on your permanent and medical record
xvideos.
There isn't one, but a lot of good porn sites. You can find a good collection on X X X R E V I E W S . O R G
If you can't use Google to find porn, you can't be more than five years old and you are far too young to be on Y!A or looking at porn.
Avoid websites since they can put nasty software on your computer. Just do a search on say Bing on what you want to view, and still will see lots of variety of videos or photos without going on their websites.
I jack off to xhamster . Com there pretty good see if you like

I'm travelling to Greece these holidays for a school trip for three weeks and I happen to get my period the day after we fly there. I have to share a hotel room with two other girls and I don't think that it's very courteous of me to leave tampons and pads in the uncovered bin. Can someone suggest anything that I could do to dispose of my stuff...
Im assuming they're about the same age as you so they must have gotten their periods as well. Im sure they understand but some girls can be immature so its understandable. Actually, most girls I know are very open about their periods. If you dont already, just wrap them in toilet paper/tissue and dispose of them.
All you need to do is wrap up the pads and tampons in toilet paper and throw them in the bin. No big deal. Nobody will care.
Bring ziploc bags with you. You can wrap them in lots of toilet paper first and then put them in the bags and into the bin.
Just wrap them in toilet paper before putting in bin.
wrap them up with toilet paper
Lucky you. Mine only reached 3 inches and I'm a 17.
Less than 5% of all men on earth are 7 inches or more.
Small, I'm 15 and my penis is 12 inches when flaccid.
you're young why are you even worried about your penis length?? Until you reach the age of 18 the only thing you should use your penis for is urinating that's it.
Zzzzz-zzzzzz
why obsess about the size of your penis,, there is nothing you can do to make it bigger or smaller other than cosmetic surgery.. worrying about size is pointless
You're bad at math
small if you are afro american
Just because junkies post on here about their mutts getting into their weed does not all junkies have dogs. Try broadening your mind just a wee bit and watching a show called intervention, it will make you look like an idiot, which you are. Not every single junky has a dog.
You now find your question in a far better category ( oh and some of them dont have dogs either..... as it goes) Many Junkies are richer than you would think.... and thats a fact
Really, how do you know, are you a junkie.
They don't, so stop generalizing.

I live in the UK and I have some symptoms of depression but I don t know whether it s normal to have them or if it is depression. I once tried telling my mum and she said its nothing she s kind of not opening up to the fact that I might be depressed. I don t have anyone else to contact. Anyway my question is that if I go to a gp clinic or psychologist will my mum find out? I m only fifteen and she ll be angry if I go without her permission. What is another alternative? Can I overcome it without telling some one?
UK answer. You are old enough to see medical professionals and receive treatment without your parents knowing. Do go and see a GP and if necessary you'll be referred to child and adolescent mental health services [CAMHS] for an assessment and treatment which will be a form of talking therapy. Your mum would only be told that you're in treatment if you're a suicide risk; this is not the same as having suicidal thoughts.
I think you can see your GP confidentially but I'm not completely sure because you're only 15. I think you should try talking to your mum again and tell her how worried you are and that you want to talk to a doctor about how you're feeling.
There are a number of online forms that you ask a few simple questions and make a rough estimate of your level of depression. This one is on the NHS web site: http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/depression...
OK... So my entire life (I'm currently 31), my face sweats ferociously when eating french fries. ONLY french fries. No other foods. No other potato products. JUST french fries. It doesn't matter if they are frozen or bought at a restaurant. Doesn't mater if they are seasoned, salted or plain. It happens with all cuts..seasoned fries, waffle fries, crinkly, shoestring, etc. ALL FRENCH FRIES and ONLY FRENCH FRIES. Does anyone have any bright ideas as to why this happens? Nobody I ask has an answer
Patient - Doctor, it hurts when I do this Doctor - Then don't do that. If you want to stop seating, just stop eating french fries.
Not sure unless something obvious like they're too hot or the hot oil stasys hot longer than most foods. I'd suggest just do not eat fries if it bothers you that much!
That's unusual maybe you're allergic to them? I'd stop eating them lol do you sweat when eating plain potatoes, if you don't I would stick to potato wedges oven baked with little oil
Interesting.
Because fries are damn good and you're sweating from all that tasty goodness. ...Now to be serious, talk to a doctor about it if it makes your concerned for your health.
Another update... I'm in good health, athletic body type, and this happens whether I dip them in any sauce or eat them plain. This isn't life or death, but for the love of god I want answers!
You may be allergic to something in the fries. Stop consuming them and contact a doctor.
Vghh
Stop eating them
Its not that healthy but nothing to worry about - short term. You probably need to eat more calories for good health. You can use this calorie calculator to determent how many calories you need per day. You probably should shoot for one pound of weight loss a week. Bigger people can sustain higher rates but you aren't very big and you just lost ten pounds. No reason to over do it. Also remember that if you lose weight really quickly you tent to just gain it back. http://www.calculator.net/calorie-calcul...
This product is AMAZING!!..if taken right and used with exercise, you will see results. I lost 11 pounds in 2 weeks using weight loss gren store tea!.. I didnt have to change my eating habits or anything. Also weight loss gren store tea company, are attentive, and truly care about their customers! As results keep improving I will keep ordering!
Uh yeah I'd say it's not that bad, But that's from me and I do crazy crap like 20lb in 2 weeks.
There is a flood gate in every big dam to regulate the discharge of water. You should ask the in-charge of the dam who operates and maintains such a big dam.
yes
Because that's the way the body works.
its very very good to eat. start eating it. its amazing
That's often normal. It's your body encouraging you to mate and reproduce. Your only choices are to ignore it (which is obviously difficult) or "take care of it" as needed.
Of course you're horny while you are having a period. From the standpoint of avoiding pregnancy, that is the safest time you can have sex. While you are menstruating, there is no mature egg in your body to be fertilized; and, even if there was, there is no lining inside your uterus for a fertilized egg to implant itself into - you are shedding that lining when you are menstruating. Your body "knows" this, and it's telling you, 'go for it, honey'! So, you get horny. There is no reason why you can't have sex or masturbate while you are having a period.
Why stop. Make love with your husband. Men care about this a lot less than women. Have an extra towel on hand and go for it.
I think this is normal. I'm the same. Use a cervical cap or a diaphragm to stop the blood flow and you can enjoy sex during your period.
OK, what you need to do is have lots of sex until that horniness goes away. :), happy to help!
Hormones don't stop
Why would you want to try to block natural urges?
well, get some backdoor action, or hell if he like sauce sex while on yo period
Just don't masturbate

Huh? Anyone who starts a question with "Atheists: Does Your God.......?" obviously has the mental capacity of smoked herring. Then to follow with words preceded with random numbers proves it. Whatthefuck are you babbling about?

You shud just, stop blaming yourself for whatever past. The past is only there to learn from it, to not repeat it in the present time, so you, your kids, and your teeth can have a better, cleaner, healthy, and happy future! Dirt off your shoulders after falling, and keep it up. Is not how long it takes to fix our lives but the fact to get the job done!
So it's still all about you, isn't it? Why don't you get out of bed and help your kids NOW? If you can't help them, help some other kids. There are plenty who need help. Stop thinking about yourself.
Have you apologized to your children? Most want to love their parents but certain things make it hard an apology could go a long way in healing.
Uh......so you're remorseful about the past that has hurt your kids, but staying in bed every day IS HURTING your kids TODAY.
Wrong category buddy
Jesus died for all our sins and mistakes. He died so we might be forgiven and have eternal life. If you pray to Him and ask Him to save you He will.

It's not going to be any worse than the dentist. With a local anesthetic, you won't feel a thing. Just close your eyes and try not to look at what they are doing as this will only worry you. Just get it over with. I'm sure your doctors know how to keep his patients comfortable and out of pain. Have a little faith. Once it is over, you can be sent home, and on the road to recovery.
Don't worry! It's a minor surgery you said. I have also two major surgery but I am fine. Go to a best doctor who care the patient.
You'll be so happy to get it removed! I didn't have a lipoma removed, but i have had all four wisdom teeth out. My only regret was not getting them pulled sooner. I'm sure you'll feel the same about this. Feel better! If it's a local anesthetic, then make sure you tell them if you are in ANY pain at any point. They'll give you more. But that stuff is pretty powerful, so you might feel some tugging or pressure, but no pain.
Get on line and Google dr pimple popper. (Dr. Sandra Lee is her real name) and watch some of her videos on removing lipomas from the scalp. They are incredibly amazing with folks under local anesthesia and watching them made me decide to have mine removed after seeing how easy it really is. My old German grandfather used the phrase 'you fathead' when someone was acting stupid. Now i give him no real reason to carry around extra fat on my head! Breathe. Know we are praying for you and just do it!
Once they knock you out dream of beauty.. It's only the needle that hurt. Once awaken the pain is gone. And you'll be your old self again. Hope you mend fast and take care!...I've have know some folks who had this done and are happy with it..
Don't worry, hun. I have had so many surgeries and I am still fine. You will be happy to get it removed and get it over with! One day my husband had surgery on his face, and it was right next to his nose, and he did it all without anesthesia. You are going to be fine, hun, trust Me.
One of my favorite quotes is "It's always darkest before everything goes completely black". I also like "Artificial Intelligence will never be a match for natural stupidity".
don't worry lol I am goin have surgery too just don't trip they know what they goin do you'd be fine alright ? just remember you a badass
You have nothing to worry about,As you say its under local anesthetist, So that proves its not as bad as you think,I will bet when its all over,You will think to yourself,Why did I worry about that for nothing,And you can trust me on that too, ps,May I thank you for the BA too.
i agree with you but i guess they have nothing better to do than ask stupid questions
What i know is my d!ck pleases me. If i pleases a girl well then its great. But its the nature of guy to ask that, its part of an evolutionary trait, in primal view you need to be the guy.est of all, you need to show how fit you are...
Same brainless reason kids ask "how tall will I be when I grow up"
Aw c'mon. Just Say No.
it's a young male thing, they are deadly interested in their own shlong size. maybe a genetic social stuff, nobody knows why
they dont have a clue.......i learned at an early age that my di ck is to make me happy.......if the woman is pleased too, its a bonus
I've heard chicks say this about the tightness of their puss.
what do you expect from kids who know nothing about sex and pleasure .
that's a good question. so I don't think stress ever ends in life but it just changes with changing circumstances and ages. adolescence is extremely stressful, where you are now, and is possibly the most stressful time of life. sometimes things do get better when you grow up some and develop coping skills. I don't know that much about adhd and what can be done about it. have you tried exercise and yoga?
You're asking two different questions. Research supports that humans experience the same amount of general stress all through their lives, with the exception being traumatic events. As to the ADHD, I myself have ADD and I've managed to more embrace it than allow it to annoy me. The trick is that while adults argue that we have more stress, the years have just taught us to have a higher tolerance and deal with it. Just keep a stiff upper lip for the next few years and I've no doubt that you will learn the coping mechanisms which make life bearable.
You can outgrow laziness, but not stress. Stress is an individual thing. Stress can be very intense for teens because they have so few ways to cope with it. For adults stress can be awful due to the responsibilites and duties of supporting yourself or others.
Mental illnesses are unfortunately not an age thing. They can occur in people of all ages. It's not something you "grow" out of persay, but it is something you can overcome! I'm sure you've heard this before, but consulting a doctor could help if your anxiety and ADHD are severe. Don't be so hard on yourself either. It takes time and will get better when you are more confident in your abilities and are more positive. Best of luck. It'll get better :)
1) Yes. It (stresses) will go away, if they pray honestly and sincerely with implicit faith. 2) Besides in order to strengthen their willpower, they can join Yoga and meditation classes and learn their techniques. In Yoga lass they teach lot of physical exercises coupled with some mental exercise in order to keep the body and mind always fit, trim and strong. Then it is easy for you to shape your future lie according to your tastes.
Teenagers are usually more stressed because of hormones
Thank you, and I never checked with my doctor about it though, I dont think its THAT bad...But I tend to usually eat cereal for the most part...I cant figure out why I like it so much but its good, I also drink a LOT of milk...
acidic diet ?.....most peoples problems are their own doing....what they stuff their face with etc....they give more thought to the kind of oil they put in their car than their gut......and you cannot ask an md, only trained to precribe drugs, they don't know nutrition....you want proof, when was the last time your doctor asked what you ate?! he can't afford to waste time talking about something he don't know about, besides, the next patient is waiting ...
Probably your urine produced overnight is just really acidic and causing irritation when you pee the first time. Though not sure how to stop that.
dry it
Because bread becomes just carbs and sugars in your body which means they basically just become fats in your body. Didn't you watch Scott Pilgrim vs The World? Bread makes you fat
As they want to avoid excess carbs. Carbs slow you down and do not help in building muscles.
because BREAD is WEAK
bread makes you fat.
carbs to sugar to fat
Nothing will happen, masturbating is normal, natural, healthy and safe. I been masturbating since I was 13 and it hasn't any harm.
Just inefficient with a girl nothing else
The body thinks you're having sex. Does no consequence to having sex daily.

the definition of a "condition" is- A disease or physical ailment. so there is no distinction between the words. Eczema is a general term encompassing various inflamed skin conditions. One of the most common forms of eczema is atopic dermatitis (or "atopic eczema"). Eczema is not contagious and, like many diseases, currently cannot be cured. However, for most patients the condition may be managed well with treatment and avoidance of triggers
It's a Condition.
it's a condition.
That depends on what you mean by "fine." An addiction does not turn somebody into a crazy person. It consumes their life but the addiction itself doesn't make them any more prone to having emotions than any other person. The fact is that most people who have suffered addiction also had a traumatic episode or event occur at some point in their life that they had not learned to deal with.
I think it's like everyone, you can have a good day or a bad day. Except with addicts they go to more extreme ends of the spectrum, from feeling super euphoric to super sh*t
Recently there have been developments in certain types of drugs that BLOCK the effectiveness of the substances he may be addicted to. You DID NOT SPECIFY what HE IS ADDICTED TO.
well we have our good days and than we have our bad days
Caffeine does not stunt penile growth when taken in the small quantities normally found in cups of tea or coffee. You can safely drink several cups of coffee every day.
No, not true for one thing, and 2nd, your penis probably reached its final adult size by the time you hit 15 anyway- like nearly every other guy.
well friend, iam 58 and i been drinking coffee all my life and it didnt interfer with the growth of mine.
Not that I'm aware of. Go measure it. < M
No effect.
no, sure not, and insead it makes problems
i honestly dont know what to do anymore. they diagnosed me with psychotic depression and ednos. im still not sure if they are lying, i truly believe there is nothing wrong with me and i dont need help and im not ill. im so confused i honestly feel there is nothing wrong with me and that my psychiatrist and doctor are just wanting to make me believe them. i just wanna cry, but what if i do have them, please someone help me and show me how to accept my illnesses if i do have them, because im tired of it.
There may not be anything wrong with you. there is something wrong in the 21st Century imo with all this therapy, need to label personality traits, everyone has a "mental illness" now. BS. Good for you for thinking for yourself. Don't be a sheep. There are enough out there. You don't have to accept anything but accept yourself for who you are. Not what some bore in a room with a certificate tells you so he can stay employed.
Get a second opinion, if you're not sure. In all realms of medical care, a wrong diagnosis can occur. Often, mental diagnosis are difficult- and require a specialist sometimes to ferret out the true disorder. You could just be in denial, or it could be that you need a different doctor of some kind. See someone for a second opinion. Share with them what you've asked here. See if you can't get to a better place.
You can't see sperm. It's microscopic. And you seriously need to learn how to write correctly.
Sperm is commonly swallowed by girls who like performing oral sex with a man, called a ********. It can't harm you, if your guy is healthy, with no infections.
Highly unlikely...
not if youre not allergic already
no
Burning when you pee is a common symptom of a UTI. Women can get UTIs from sex. Do you have the feeling you have to pee a lot, and sometimes when you do there isn't much there? Could be a UTI. If you had rough sex and caused friction, you could also just be sore and your skin is irritated. It could be a STI, but I wouldn't think your showing symptoms within 24 hours.
If you have had unprotected sex you can get sexually transmitted diseases, and pregnancy of course! get yourself checked out at a STD clinic,and use condoms in future.
do you know what a rug burn is? when you rub your skin back and forth on anything it will rub away skin. then urinate on that...salty...hurts.
Latex allergy from condom
You need to decide where to place appropriate commas before you do anything else. This is NOT Yahoo study-hall. Take a remedial English class please. Your writing-skills are atrocious.
They're both the exact same kind of room so what does it matter?
You can also go suck your own dick and just pee there, but you'd probably get off on that.

Add. Try just sitting and drifting off in your thoughts a couple minutes each day. While you're in your thoughts you will just stop rocking. You have to be deeeeeep in your thoughts. That's what worked for me
Tell a dr about this; maybe an internist. Whatever this is, there are probably good meds for it.
Have you ever taken the ADD 'test' ??
In her sleep, she sees herself sleeping and she knows everything that is going on in the house.. but she just can t wake up.. sometimes it takes her a good 10 minutes..this morning, she was taking a nap , and she felt someone sit on the bed, and started pushing her chest in when no one was there .. I want to know what could possibly be the reason.. Then just a few moments ago, she got awaken .. she heard someone whistle right in her ear.. IT WAS 3:00 IN THE MORNING.. she was freaking out and crying hestirically.. she says she feels like something bad is after her.. could someone possibly help?!
I would say it's possible that she's experiencing sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis is basically when your mind wakes up before your body does. So you're conscious, but your body is still asleep, and so you can't move. It often comes with dreams, of a sort. And a feeling of dread, thinking someone is there, or feeling pressure on your chest are very common ones. I would have her talk to her doctor about this, since it's hard to be sure that's what it is. But it sounds like it very well could be sleep paralysis.
Not sure if this question should be posted in Mental Health or the Paranormal. 3am is the Devils hour or witches hour. It sounds paranomal activity to me, keep a diary of events. Could be a possible haunting , these days there are local ghost hunters who will be able to advise Feeling someone sit on the bed , someone pushing her chest and whistling in her ear all sounds like some form of ghost activity. Could get checked out by Doctor but I'd take into the account of possible paranormal activity , if you believe in that
Same with me but not that serious like that, my friends, try change a pillow that can support our breath. So many person that is hard to wake is because we can't get any nice sleep which is so important to us. When oxygen is not circling well in our body, yeah it is so hard to wake up. Look If we can buy a nice pillow that can support our neck, if didn't work maybe we should see a doctor. :)
She is most likely experiencing sleep paralysis. If this continues she should speak to her doctor about going for a sleep study test to find out what is going on in those moments.
She needs to see a sleep therapist.
It depends on the source of the problem. If it is spiritual - it would be necessary to take it to God and Lord Jesus Christ, by study of the His word, the Bible, repentance of sins, prayer, fasting. https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?se... Otherwise - to address medics.
There is nothing like that you must fantasize someone while masturbating. I masturbate concentrating on my cock only. There is no sin as we are not doing any harm to any one by masturbating. Hurting another one is sin , so also cheating another one We are not doing any such thing . Regards
Not a sin ever, just solo sex, a natural urge that has nothing to do with religion. Guys were masturbating a million years before religion was invented.
With IQ lower than 30 you may ask this sort of question... No healthy-relationship-dating.com/masturb...
Yes, it is sowing the ways of the flesh, as the Bible says - it leads to death. We have to walk by the Holy Spirit, by love, purity, self-control. Here's a Christian article about it: http://porn-free.org/masturbation.htm
Are you left or right handed
no its not doing what you describe is not a sin
no
I know all about depression, so please don't discuss this. What I'm referring to is hating civilization and resenting existence. More than one person has commented that I am more bitter than anyone else they have ever known. I've turned to religion, psychiatry, homeopathy, all of which have been dead ends. Romance and sex are of sub-microscopic interest to me. Is there any alternative left but suicide?
Are you homicidal? Then you need to go to the hospital for the Haldol and lithium . If you're depressed you should try Marijuana or Vicodin. It delivers the right amount of smiley dopamine that will make you happy. You can go to your inner city to ask around for a drug dealer....they all know one. Sex is the best on Marijuana. it will be the most mind blowing sex u ever had. Vicodin helps get rid of the bad thoughts.
Meditation helps. So does the acceptance that "enjoying" life is a modern psychiatric burden. Just try existing, and not judging that for a while.
Try taking 5-HTP and read the book A New Earth by Edkhart Tolle. After doing these two things I think life will take on a much better course for you. At least give it a try, please.
everyone dreams about leaving society... no one does it. you could live in it and distract your self as best as possible, live outside it and survive as best as possible, or live above it and hide as best as possible. the best option is to live outside it but in order for you to truly be happy you'll need human contact of some sort. at least a traveling buddy or someone to talk to.
You should lose a couple of pounds a week with diet and exercise. It might be harder since you aren't really overweight anyway.
2 months
Depends on how hard you work. If you run once a week and eat like **** then you're not losing crap. You need too avoid saturated fats and sugars and do all sorts of cardio
It should take you about two months.
Well if u have proper diet and exercise it will take a moth
" I do the praying for god to show me a sign everything is okay I get nothing." Now we stop there , with that what you said , you did`t even found God.Who are you to expect God to answer you?Why do you think that you mom is in Heaven?Having no friends is your own problem, you even don`t need to cry about it.Who gave you right to poison yourself with drugs in hope that they will help? Better prepare yourself before you die , your mother is done , so will you one day , so do I.
Go online and find websites that teach basic relaxation meditation for free. Practice often. Then, use those techniques when you are in the bathroom to relax yourself. It may take some time, but it should work. Many people with phobias get significant relief from meditation.
That is normal for a human, that sounds like mostly a fear of embarrassment, which basically all humans have. Hope this helped -Kori-
Go to the bathroom and don't worry about anybody else.
U should consult a psychologist
It's no longer called Manic Depression.... they changed it to Bipolar Disorder 50 years ago. Also... Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression) is not when you have rapid emotional moods... it is when you have periods of depression and periods of mania (hence the prior name of Manic Depression). The moods last a bare minimum of 2 weeks for depression and 1 week for mania... in reality they last for many weeks or months or even years. Based on "having rapid mood swings" I gotta say no, it's not Bipolar. Could be stress, anxiety, hormones, thyroid issues and much much more..... but rapid mood swings is not Bipolar.
I would suggest you speak with your regular Doctor. He/she will likely ask you some questions about your feelings, and will help prescribe you the correct medication to help with this. It sometimes is a method of trial and error to find you the correct medication but at least this is a step in the right direction! Keep your head up, and stay strong!
generally manic depressives are not aware of the mood swings.
If the two of you want to do that you can. You could also try getting him a penis extension to use.

Your penis at 6 inches is a lot bigger than the average of 3 to 4 inches for your age. Since you are 13, there is the possibility it will even grow some more.
If it was too big, what would you do about it? Odd statement. But above adult average of 5.16 inches, but may not grow that much more if you are an early developer. But very good size of course. All the guys claiming 7 or 8 inches, this year or next year, they lie.
Oh, it's too big for a 13 year old = you not allowed more than 3.6 inches. Seriously = that is bigger than many adults so may not grow much more = but then you are ahead of the game. < M
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
You could used aloe vera but you have to cut the spines and when you cut it open it in the middle and then put it where you have the pimples and then leave it for 30 minutes it would be tickling you and then you could go watched it off
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
Don't jump on Accutane first! Try getting on Birth Control! and go to dermatologist and ask for a clindamycin cream which is an antibiotic! either for that or if you have more severe acnes ask for a combination of clindamycin and benzo per oxide!
Tell you want. *IF* you can come-up with a way to do that, I'll be your new bestest friend & we'll both be swimming in cash !!! SWIMMING !! .... Call me ...
avoid oily food..chemicals..try herbs example splitted greengram paste can be used for cleaning..
Don't be silly! Inserting chewable Vitamin C into your vagina won't prevent or cure ANYTHING.
The chewable pill often have sugar so this would be very bad to put in your vagina. What are you trying to prevent or solve?
You can only put chewable vitamins in your ******** if yours can chew it. But in that case I bet it wouldn't so DON'T!
Why you want to put vitamin c inside your vagina? It doesn't help you.
Sugary things can feed yeast.
What type of idiot would do that?
no
At least one inch to penetrate. The Vagina starts at the surface of the body, so it doesn't take much to get in there. To be sexually pleasurable to the woman, a penis should be at least 5-6 inches.
Just to penetrate? I'd say 3-4 inches. To satisfy a woman I'd say at least 5 inches. Mine is 4 inches and girls have told me mine is too small.
You mean to break through the vagina, or to enter it?
The best answer is don't do it, but anyways recently I heard of some girl who killed herself, drinking a few beers and hung herself, I know alcohol dumb you body so I bet it doesn't hurt, I know another boy who shot himself but he lived like 24 more hours on life support and then died, so that method not good, there was another 10 years old girl that was bullied at school she was in her room just for 30 minutes by herself and the parents found her dead she hung herself so I guess that method works faster.
It all depends on what method of suicide one wishes to attempt. Some may think an overdose of pills with alcohol to sleep themselves away. I once knew of a man with severe depression that tried that only to find he was unconscious for 3 days covered in vomit. I have heard of a man who hung himself due to debt. But apart from that, I believe that people who talk about killing themselves never really do it, so hope im right in thinking that you are just curious.
Jump from Burja-Khalifa, your body would reach such a speed so that when you would hit the ground, you would be dead before your brain even feels any pain. You can do skydiving while doing it so it would be a fun way to die. But just don t try it.
Define best, painless? Quick? Creative? Messy? Clean?
It is a misleading one. Your question may spoil the mood of somebody or the other. Please don't spread moral pollution. In any case, I am sorry, I have no idea about your question.
One that doesn't require a second try.
Drink bleach
Give yourself a Dutch oven.
For pain less suicide, take the vaccine of sleep and enjoy the death.
I’m glad you’re reaching out for some support today. It sounds like you’re dealing with a lot at the moment. It’s important that you let somebody close to you know how you’re feeling. A relative, trusted friend, counselor, therapist, or doctor would be a great place to start. Working together, you can come up with some coping strategies and a plan for long-term support. Know that you’re not alone and there are people out there who can help and want you to be happy. Please continue to reach out for help. PF, Counselor
It depends. Is it inherited or self-made mistake. Don't encourage such bad ideas. Always maintain perfect mental health conditions and physical fitness if you want to retain good personality. You should deal with such important issues firmly, efficiently and effectively. There is no other alternative.
Well, one can't be expected to know how to deal with the unknown. That's why there are doctors.
We can't deal with it alone, we need help from a trained mental health professional. They teach you how to cope with it.
talk to a pscychologist and discover the type of personally disorder and get treatment
I suggest you speak with a psychiatrist. Also, if you're going through a lot of stress and feeling depressed/anxious, please think about speaking with a counselor/therapist. Take care xx.
I suggest consulting a mental health professional.
Why 'cope' with it when you can get rid of it completely! Jesus loves you and he cares for you! cry out to him, If jesus can cure my depression he can surley cure any mental illness
Its called retardation
Speaking as a man who has had many girlfriends and married 3 times... yet has never been with an escort... I will tell you without any research that an escort twice a week would be cheaper than a full-time relationship. Both financially and emotionally.
As a married woman of 17 years. I would have to agree that an escort twice a week would be fun and possibly easier and cheaper...but at the end of the day those escorts get sick of it and sadly enough wants what every married man has. They want some to love them, take care of them and grow old with.
Depends on the girlfriend and the escorts. I see what you're getting at though. Sure. If I was wealthy and I lived in Nevada or I had an arrangement with some 'escorts', I'd go the escort route too. I don't have that option and I'm not about to go the girlfriend route. I could probably pull it off but I honestly don't want to bother.
An escort twice a month would be cheaper than a GF, but not twice a week. Given your choice, the GF is the more economical option.
Compared to the cost of supporting another person(s) be it a child or a wife or both. An escort twice a week would be much cheaper. Note: Daycare is almost as much as rent.
I honestly wouldn't get an escort. Or at least not as a replacement for a girlfriend. For your whole life you would be having sex with some who has no attraction to you and does it only for money and money only. There is no connection at all. If you did get one though definitely not often though.
An escort
It depends on the quality of escort you want. I honestly think it is a very low man that will want a public toilet that everyone else can use. A real man will be happy to have the responsibility of loving and caring for someone!
Personally, I would say the escort is more cost effective. But there is something to be said about emotional investments which money doesn't buy.
"an escort would never buy you a birthday present or go travelling with you or visit you at a hospital" most girlfriends wouldn't do that ether, they are completely self-absorbed
It could be. It depends on your weight, metabolism, what other medications you're on, and a variety of other factors. However, high doses of seroquel can lead to weight gain. Consult with your doctor and/or pharmacist.
You would have to ask a doctor or pharmacist. Do not get medical advice from random idiots on the internet -- incorrect advice could cause death or serious injury.

Giving and receiving - yes.

yes
Some do. I am glad that you've stopped addressing girls, and have started addressing women instead. Great job!
Giving or receiving? Everyone has different tastes.
Yes, they like giving.
yes, I love it

Yes
Nope,

Maybe talk to your counselor or a counselor at your school to see if there are any adjustments that can be made. It's good that you're doing karate as a stress reliever, but find something you can do in class like doodling or counting how many times the teacher says a specific word in their lesson. Find a way to keep engaged if the school isn't going to help you.
Talk to your teacher tell them straight like I deal with metal illnesses and I would like it if you were more cautious with how you react to my actions.Something like that. At the end of the day your the one making the change don't take no for an answer or ask your parents to talk to them. I can't believe some of these answers!
Whatever it just go with it friend. Coz but one day you'll look back your school days and smile. Student life is a golden life

Hi. They probably not giving you special classes because they don't think you need them. I had one and it's not fun to go to the meetings.
It is right in the normal range of weight and height. You might have a range of body types within the same weight of course and some light resistive exercise could do wonders for toning and confidence without requiring any weight loss. Strength and flexibility are things you will benefit from in the long run in any case. Don't need to go crazy, but a little bit might help.
No a BMI of 21 is not skinny. It is average. Audrey Hepburn had a BMI of 16.3 and she was beautiful. That BMI is skinny.
It's normal.
Your ideal weight is 100 kgs.
21 is great!.. your doing good <3 best of luck!

I literally have the exact same stats as you, and I'm 13 too. But I'm a girl. I think you shouldn't worry about having moobs because you'll really start to sprout up very soon, and your baby fat will stretch out. If you're really convinced you're overweight, then just go to the gym like once a week and do stuff. I did it like twice and now I really like going. Also if you eat junk food just eat a lot less of it at a time. Just cut back on some things and wait a year or two, it's just an awkward phase.
Eh bro its chill, Im 14 6'3 270, So I gotta moobs. But if anyone messes with me I kick there face in :D
go to the gym, train to be a fitness girl, and go to the page bodybuilding.com and ask tips from a nutritionist
Get to work and exercise. run and lift weights.
You also have to look at your grandparents on both sides of the family. Your 18 and you keep growing until your 21 so you may have a couple of more inches of height. You might even reach 6ft. There is no way to know until you stop growing.
From 18 - 20 people typically grow about 0.7cm (0.28inches) so you should be around 5'11 1/4 at your final height
At 18, you MIGHT grow a bit more but most males do finish by that age...it is rare to go on much longer, despite the urban myths frequently perpetuated here. In any case it won't be much more, certainly no more than an inch. It all depends on your genes and nothing else at this stage
Well you have a nice big ****. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches and you have that beat by an inch and could continue to grow until your in your late teens to early twenties.
Sometimes it is. Often times, if a young boy is already hung, he won't grow much larger, if any at all.
Presumably, you measured it correctly - from on top, not underneath. The proper method is from the pubic bone out to the tip of your erection, held horizontal to the floor. It's definitely not unheard of for guys to occasionally be well developed, yet still appear young-looking in other aspects of puberty. That's just genetics.
I mean, some guys are full grown at 13, while others finish in their early 20s. That is completely in the norm
Well,you have a huge thing down there. I myself am 14 and have the exact same measurements (though i have hair down there and *** a lot) You should be proud bro! Hi-five!
since there is nothing you can do other than having cosmetic surgery to alter the size of a penis, there seems little point in worrying about whether what you have is too big big enough or too small..
The pills I have purchased from Prolargent 5x5 Extreme website have worked as advertised. Lots better than Levitra and Cialis . Wife loves the feeling I can now give her.
It's normal to be so insecure that you lie about it.
Maybe you won't grow at all... So it's ok. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
yeah. probably.
We cannot possibly know if your going through a growth spurt. Think about how silly your question is kid. Only you can know that. If you are growing rapidly over a short period of time... That's a growth spurt.

No, I wouldn't. Even if you have no family, you have a friend that cares for and loves you. You are only 23, which means you have a long life ahead of you, a long life that you could make better than it is now. Even if you feel horrible now, things will change, for the better.
no, I am on the verge of going homeless because everything I have in life only define as loner, so setting myself free from the things in life that define me and letting myself free from the judgemental society i comprehend to be part of, i think i will be more happy and feel free when I go homeless....simply because I can be me and live my life being me without being tagged as a loner..and not be judged on how i live my life .....
no you shouldn't and talk to a doctor first

Great excess weightloss supplement! I am now down 15 lbs over the last few months and nothing has changed other than adding these pills to mydiet. Very happy that there are 0 side effects other than shedding the pounds. I am stock piling WeightLoss GreenStore Tea so I never run out!
this tips can help you 1.do exercise on regular basis 2.drink alot of normal water but not cold water 3.eat that type of foods which has low calories three times a day 4.drink this water in the morning daily before brushing or eating(take one glass of hot water which you can drink easily,then add one table spoon of honey and one lemon juice.mix it well) 5.don't think too much about your weight,it will give you stress 4.
Do alot of cardio workouts, and keep an eye on your diet
first u have to do is dont think about ur over weight! then all will set up!
Cut out all sodas, fast foods, fried foods, and sweets. Walking is the best exercise, or just turn on your radio and dance for a half hour everyday like I did. I am 5''5 and weighed 135. I lost 25 pounds in 5 weeks. I have kept the weight off for years, now and am maintaining a weight of 110-112. However, I don't think your fat at all.
You're really not fat at all. For your height, your weight is normal, even tending towards underweight. Any body image issues you have are that -- body image issues -- or a little bit of remaining baby fat which will go away on its own when your body matures. If you're determined to do something, try replacing some chips/chocolate/etc. from your diet with fruits and veggies. But believe me, you're not fat.
Foe your height, you are EXTREMELY close to your IDEAL weight of 115 pounds. You don't need to change a thing. Just maintain. Do squats and lunges and enjoy life.
That's a good weight. My mom is 5'2" and weighs 170! I wouldn't worry unless it gets there.
Eat lot's pf fruits and veggies. Limit salt and processed food intake. And get plenty of exercise. That's the best way to do it!
You aren't at all fat. At 14, I was 116 lbs and 5'3, and that is thin, just like you are.
I wonder if you could possibly have a hernia in your tummy? I have had them twice!
Could be constipation.

Well it will likely go off quickly during sex yes. You could learn better control and have a more intense orgasm by edging. While masturbating bring yourself up to the point of going over without allowing yourself to. Doing this several times before allowing yourself to go over will in time teach you self control over your orgasm.
Most teens orgasm quite quickly when they masturbate. Sex is somewhat of a different sensation, and with practice you can prolong the feelings without blasting off too soon. Mostly by keeping your focus on pleasuring your partner.
Try edging and make that edging last longer like 1st time, 5 minutes, repeat till 10th times 10th times, 10 minutes...so on That should help you to last longer.
You are correct- you are training your gear to respond quickly, and you don't want that.
with a partner you should be quicker
Im 11 and my breasts started developing when I turned 10. And Ill be turning 12 soon next month. And Im hoping that they will grow a bit more. But, Im suffering a bit peer pressure too. One of my friends is gloating that she has "bigger" breasts than me. I really dont care but yet still feel insecure at the same time....I need help. Will they grow?
Don't worry you'll grow. I was an A cup when I was 11, now I'm 15 and I'm D (Im very skinny too!) I'm not saying this exact thing will happen to you because everyone is different, but you will probably get bigger. Even if you dont, boobs are not everything. It won't affect your life and if your friends tease you and make you feel insecure when you tell them not to then you need better friends
Don't worry, your size is completely normal. When I was 11/12 years old I was an A cup and sure I was not the biggest I was probably small-average and now I'm 14 years old and a D cup and my boobs are still growing. I'm now one of the girls with the bigger boobs for my age and even my mum's side of the family. Your boobs will grow in time so there is nothing to worry about. So for the time being just have fun 🙃
You should NOT be worrying! I'm 11 as well, honestly I wish my boobs were smaller. I'm faster than everybody else in my school with a 34D, but that's mostly because of how I grow and my weight. An A cup is the average size for 11 year olds.lots of people in my school are either average height or/and weight, but still have flat chests or AA, so don't feel bad. They're boobs. No one should judge u because u don't have a curvy figure. You will eventually grow. Hey. Some women don't even get their period till their 25. Not gonna lie, everyone loves boobs (don't lie, u love them too), but they r a frikkin pain!!!
Of COURSE you "care" and you feel insecure about it. If you didn't, you would not have asked this question. You are only 11 years old, and your body and breasts just now BEGINNING to develop. Your breasts will continue to develop until you are at least around 18 years of age. There is no way of knowing how big they will be when you are fully grown. Take a look at your mother, your aunts, and both grandmothers. That will sometimes give you a clue as to how big your breasts may turn out to be - their size is hereditary.
sweetie, you're only 11, your body is still developing and growing everyday, you just don't notice it. breast size depends on genetics so if your mom or grand mom have bigger busts, it's likely for you to have a big bust too. on the other hand, you shouldn't be worrying about your breast size at this age, live your life freely and stop being insecure over lumps of fat on your chest.
You're barely into puberty, so yes your breasts will grow in the future though. Don't feel insecure about your breast size. You're only a child.
Yeh of course. I'm 12 atm and only an A cup. My breasts are quite small for my age but I don't care. Ignore your friends because if they were true friends they wouldn't boast and be mean. But yeah they will so don't worry :)))
In sea water. It will clean and heal your wound.
You can but you should cover it with gauze and plastic (water-proof it) or risk an infection or infecting others.
It's better not to ... Whether at the beach or at a pool ...
Don't contaminate the water
where are you swimming
Do you have aids?
What is it that pisses you off so fecking much? It's not like I stand outside your church with a megaphone every Sunday declaiming against Theism.
I thought you made a great point peaches - I'm your #1 fan ... shitdoggy!!
See? Xtians are murderous wastes of flesh. They will do anything to get their way. Even if it involves children and the crippled. They are sociopathic garbage.
Ah, xtian love.
Yes they are like rats; they breed at an alarming rate. Not that I would want to insult rats.
One might bring forth one's god - poof, atheism disappears.
Teenage hormones are unpredictable. Until your late teens you will probably have roller emotions. If you still feel down and worthless at age 16, tell a dr. and ask for Zoloft which is a wonderful antidepressant.
Just Watch some tv
Could this be a case of normal adolescent mood swings? If so, hang on, they will go away.
drink beer and listen to loud uplifting love songs. feels good .
In excess, and over time it can.
Depends on how much you drink. If you drink enough you will look like someone with no self esteem.
It sure can....one to many could cause you to fall and cause damage to your body
I m allergic to all metals- even surgical steel earrings give me a rash, even though that s supposed to be impossible! Stone, bone and shell jewellery can be really beautiful. Depending on what you want the ring for, rings made out of jade, quartz, and obsidian are easy to find, and quartz comes in all colors. Bone, wood and glass jewellery can be much sturdier than you might think. Avoid anything with copper, nickel, bronze, brass, or alloys, because you ll almost definitely be allergic to those as well.
Wow, I'm allergic to those too. Never expected to find another person like that. Platinum and copper would work.
Bronze? Plastic? Steel?
Platinum
Titanium
Everything else.
Bronze?
I have a tungsten ring. I have stainless steel chains. I have a brass chain that matches my brass pendent.
stainless steel, platinum, resin, bone, horn, tungsten steel,copper, lots of semi precious stones like jade, leather, cord, stainless steel wire wrapped rings
It is best not to shave your genitals unless you intend to devote time every day to re-doing it. When you shave you leave stub be which can become very prickly in a day (or possibly two). If you want to work on your pubic hair then it is better to simply trim it shorter. Most males don't do anything to their pubic hair but leave it totally natural.
I shave mine completely smooth once a week, I love the bald look, and I've never had any problems.
for me, thick natural bush with shaved shaft and nuts.
i prefer to trim mine
Completely bare is best
i dont care for the little kid...............plucked chicken look
Yes, it's normal. The anesthesia can leave you feeling itchy, so can residue in your mouth after the teeth were pulled. Take some Benadryl, it should help with the itching. If the itching lasts more than 72 hours, call your dentist.
There are some products that numb your gums temporarily, such as Anbusol. Clove oil is a natural product that has the same effect (and tastes like cloves); you can also get it at the drugstore. It does not seem like the sensation should last longer than today.
it is normal if you have not taken your pain meds yet. you are supposed to take them before the numbing wears off. and DO NOT put ambesol or orajel or cloves into your extraction wound and do not rinse or spit today. follow your after care instructions that the dentist gave you and not any of the really bad advice you have been given here by Biff or Zoozu I am sure your after care instructions do not say it is ok to rinse or spit today or to put anything in the wound
itchy? no idea - rinse in salt water to help heal and keep clean
Probably the anesthetic starting to wear off. Call the doctors office if you are concerned
Make a detailed list of your symptoms, negative thoughts, and specific episodes. Write down everything you can think of. Then give that to your mother to read and let that start a conversation about how to get you help.
You may have both. Tell your parents you want counseling and to give you a date of an appointment.
gO TO a dermatologist about your skin. Tell a dr. how you feel; there are good meds for anxiety.
You need help. Pls see a Dr tell your parents or ler them read this.
I m a 16 year old female who weighs 210 pounds and is only 5 4". I absolutely HATE moving and exercising besides walking and I have absolutely no motivation to eat healthier or force myself to exercise, plus with me I go to an extreme like throwing up or not eating at all. I hate that I m obese and I gained 40+ lbs from an old antidepressant, so now I hate myself more. How do I get motivation?? Not go too extreme?? I NEED to lose weight. Thank you so much, a concerned sophomore.
You have to eat less than you're burning. If you're sitting around and want to lose weight, you'll have to eat a lot less. Install an app or use a website like MyFitnessPal - you can track your calories on there and see where your'e going wrong. You can't lose weight by sitting around wishing you were thin. You'll have to do something.
no one can help you if you don't wanna help yourself :/. I can sit here and list workouts and foods, etc. but I can't MAKE you do it. It's all up to you. If you really want to do it, push yourself. Or maybe if you have a friend who also wants to lose weight, see if they'll be your workout buddy. Maybe even a personal trainer at a gym. But a trainer WILL push you extremely.
Very good. I will subscribe for this Weight Loss Green Store Tea product monthly.
I'm a virgin, because I don't like the way that I look. My vagina is pink at the clitoral hold, and brownish purple the rest of the way down. It's loose and a little saggy and wrinkly on the darker parts. No skin covers my Clit whatsoever. My clit isn't tiny either, it sticks out pretty far. And in really very self conscious about it. Help?!
All vaginas are different. You should not worry about yours because it really is totally normal for it to look like that, I promise. Some girls have clitorises from 1mm to half an inch across. It is no big deal at all. Plus, most guys do not care either. As long as you keep it clean and healthy, you are perfectly fine.
Can't really tell just from a description, but it doesn't sound all that different, so I doubt it is ugly.
Young lady that is way TMI, everyone woman/girl looks the same way just as teens and men. You are normal but I'd never speak w/ a guy about this.
Doesn't matter what it looks like, I'm not a guy. But unless your vagina is ******** and doesn't smell guys don't care lol
Believe me that any guy that has the chance to get into a women's vagina and have intercourse with her is not going to care how your vagina looks. Just so long as he knows you want him in you. Make sure to use protection.
Hi, this is kinda embarrassing, so I'll make it brief. I am 16 years old and I have hair all over my body. What's weird is I have had no facial hair and very little to no penile growth. I know that cannot be correct because everyone in my family ( both sides) has facial hair, even my older brother. I also have a very small penis. I would say that it hasn't grown at all. Now I know that isn't correct either because ( don't ask how) I have seen my father's penis before and it's bigger than mine.
I would say your just a hairy man and haven't fully hit puberty yet. Do you have pubic hair? Or any other signs of puberty? I would just keep an eye out and maybe if in doesn't start growing in a month or two. Try to set up and appointment with your physican and they will have a better answer.
You hit puberty years ago, need to read up on what puberty entails. As to penis size, by 16 you should be done growing down there-- average guy is 5.16 inches erect.
A lot of people hit puberty at different times. So just be patient. If you feel comfortable to tell a doctor, ask him. I think you should because by now it should've changed. Hope this helps
Most people consider hitting puberty for guys as being able to ejaculate; there are also other indicators such as a voice change, acne, muscle growth, height growth, hair growth, etc. You could just be delayed, but maybe asking a doctor would help and he (or she) could diagnose your Tanner Stage.
Men stop growing round 16.
From how you're describing it, it sounds like you had a heat stroke.. I had one a few years ago while playing softball in Arizona. If it was moderately hot that day then it probably was one. They're not uncommon. If it happens again, immediately sit down and breath deeply. (It helps with the pain after a while) and then once you've recovered a bit, tell your teacher.
Did you run on an empty stomach? Out in the heat? Are you fighting a cold or flu bug?
You probably didn't eat or drink enough and/or you had an anxiety attack.
Heat stroke maybe
Of course as others have said the vagina is an internal organ but the word is often used to refer to the vulva which is a little confusing. Shaving down there sounds a bit tricky even with an electric shaver. Its probably easiest to just trim is as short as you can around the labia
You don't shave your vagina, that is inside you. You shave the labia, mons and perineum just like you shave anything, carefully with a good shave creme. Better is to go get a Brazilian wax however, shaving causes stubble and razor bumps down there which are uncomfortable.
Whenever I shave mine, I sit down in the shower and kind of bend over so you can get a better look at the angle you're coming from. At some points you may have to use your hand to find any hairs that you missed, and go back and make them able to be cut by using your hand to move skin out of the way.
No razors... i just use a shaving cream that you leave on for 5 minutes and wipe off with a cloth. No cuts no bleeding. Works every time. I use the product by Nairs and Veet has a similar one as well.
You CAN'T shave your vagina, even if you want to. Your vagina is INSIDE your body!
i think you should take a few time to learn the structure of the reproductive system. some organs in the female reproductive system, what are their functions? and what you should notice in your daily life? your question is the simplest question, i can say,you did not know your structure of the body. Absolutely, you cannot shave your whole vagina, it exists inside your body.
Your vagina is an internal organ, and is therefore hairless. You cannot shave a hairless internal organ, no matter how much you want to.
I'm 18 now, I have had acne nonstop everyday of my life since I was 11 or 12. It refuses to go away. I wash my face at least once a day, with acne wash, I try to keep a healthy diet, all I drink is water, and I use acne medication at night and still I have whiteheads popping up every day. I have no idea what to do anymore. Should I go to the dermatologist?
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
If it bothers you that bad, then yes. There are also home remedies that can help. My favorite is lemon juice and baking soda. Cheap but it's awesome. And a mint julup mask you can get at any dollar store for like 5 bucks. I use that, too. It pulls all the gunk out of your pores c:
That would be a good direction to go. A dermatologist has options you don't get over the counter.
Everyone is different, not everyone has large or even average breasts. I'm not a girl but I'm 28 and my erect penis is only 4 inches long!
Everyone has one boob bigger than the other... And your breasts are A cups because they are.... you're probably not finished growing.
Chaos.
EVERYONE does NOT wind up with large breasts
This genuinely isn't like when most people pretend they have OCD, I'm almost definite I have it as there are so many things I can't not do otherwise I seriously believe something bad will happen. All of these things are taking over my life and I don't want to have to do them but I have to I don't really know how to explain it but I just have to and I don't know what to do about it. All I know is that I want it to stop, so what do I do about OCD?
Tell a dr. how you feel. There are good meds for OCD.
see a counselor, therapist. anti OCD meds work very well.

Unless you were watching something with noise in the background, I don't think she knew. If you were answering slow, or like you were distracted, she could have thought anything. But no, I don't think she knows you were doing that.
She probably suspected it, they no for sure that in some time you will do that. But its not a big deal for them since its natural and safe. Just be careful not to get caught coz thats embarrasing. Do it privately.
i doubt so. During her time, kids only started doing what you are doing at a much later date- usually late teens. Be rest assured she didn't know
How can you continue masturbating while talking to your mom? Moms are a total erection killers
Yeah. Parents know what we do because they were once our age. Everyone does it it's totally natural.
i highly doubt she knew what you were doing
she's not dumb, she knows that you do it but i highly doubt it crosses her mind since she is your mom.
She may not know. Behave with her as if nothing happened . Regards.
Probably, parents know when their kids are lying and they know they masturbate.
If she has caught you doing it before.
This may sound gross but I have the habit of picking at my acne. Because of this, I now have scabs and Im very self consious about them. (I know that's gross once again) Anytime I get more acne, I always get the urge to pick at it, and its really starting to become a habit. Ive also tried covering up where Ive picked with makeup, but it just makes it look darker. Do any of yall have any advice? Thanks.
Put a semi-tight rubber band around your wrists and pop yourself hard every time you catch yourself doing it. Sounds dumb but it pretty much trains you to associate picking at acne with sharp pain. It psychological teaches you to stop. Worked for me. Good luck!
Fix them and there will no issues with picking - Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types.

I have chronic gastritis for 2 months and used to have H. Pylori. My age is 19 and have had blood tests that come back clean. My symptoms are burping, a false sense of shortness of breath, and fainting. I have been to the ER about 5 times already. Should I go or am I overexagerating? Please help me I'm losing my mind.
Don't say you have fainting if you aren't, it can misdirect a diagnosis, you probably can wait to see a good internist, and You should, but I am not examine you, you will have to decide. You need a bigger work up than the ER is equipped to provide
And what have they done at the ER the 5 times? nothing? Then don't go. It's a waste.
After 5 trips to the ER ( and at what cost) and they haven't helped you, isn't it time for you to find a primary care physician who would take a special interest in you and your problem???
Yes. Go to the ER
No you will not lose your finger. A possibility you could lose the nail but doubtful.
The skin surrounding it is like coming off too and the nail is loose from the side a little bit.. I bite my nails and it became a habit for 4 years..
Nah you'll be fine. You'll probably just lose the nail. Just put a bandaid over it and poor some poroxide on it and it should be fine in a couple of weeks.
Possibly.
You sound really silly.
I had anal sex today , and today is also the 2nd day of my period , he did finish inside of me but I didn't even know and he didn't tell me until I asked , I asked because I felt a lot of liquid afterwords and I stood up and it all dripped down by my vaginal area , I had a tampon in , and I'm wondering if that could of helped anything , the boy this happened with is not helping with my concern at all and it in fact at a party right now! So I'm just really scared and paranoid, no rude answers please . Should I take plan b?
I would not recommend you having any more sex. You seem a little immature and unaware of how your body works, and you clearly should not be having sex. However, I can understand your paranoia. In regards to another answer on here you definitely CAN get pregnant on your period. While I don't think you are pregnant, I would take plan B just to be on the safe side. And I also would not recommend revisiting sex with your partner if they think it is okay to finish in you without your permission.
No, you can't get pregnant during your periods...anal sex can make you pregnant in only one condition that is if you have rectovaginal fistula (is a medical condition where there is a fistula or abnormal connection between the rectum and the vagina).Always remember that in periods no one can get pregnant no matter they do unsafe.so Don't worry
Kids who have this concern have anal sex?! I was definitely not thinking of anal sex when I was in high school... Or college for that matter...
unless ur anus is somehow connected to your Fallopian tubes, no you cannot get pregnant through anal sex. also, stay away from that guy. he clearly doesn't respect you as to put you in a risk of pregnancy by finishing inside you without permission smh
Sweetie, if you think you can get pregnant through anal sex, perhaps you should not be having sex at all.
I would suggest you take plan B if your really worried. Just know that it's normal when you take plan b for you to spot or have an abnormal looking period. I also, like others suggest you educate your self a little better on sex if you plan to be sexually active. A pregnancy test this soon is not going to be accurate because it is way to soon to tell.
Don't have any sex or even think about sex anymore until you know how your body works and what can/might happen as a result.
no hun you should be fine sense it was only anal sex but do plan b if you are worried. hope all works out for you. people on this should just give awnsers and not judge
no, don't listen to those jerkolas. do not mess with your body's natural chemistry. they want you to get fat.
Anything fatty. Buy loads of snacks and eat them whenever you feel peckish. Have bigger portions of food at dinner. You are skinny for your height, and you might have a fast metabolism, which basically means your body burns fat fast so it's hard to gain weight. Although, don't gain weight just because your friends say so. If you don't think you're too skinny and you like your weight, then don't listen to them. Look how you want to look. Don't care what they think. You're young, and your metabolism will get slower as you age, although you won't have a drastic change of it until you're much older.
Just eat a balanced diet. A variety of meat and fish. Plenty of vegetables and fruit, cereal with milk. If you suddenly eat things just to put on weight you are setting yourself up for a lifetime of bad habits. Enjoy being slim whilst it lasts. Teenagers are often slim whilst their bodies grow suddenly. You'll settle back down into your frame soon enough. Experiment with your wardrobe instead and take no notice of what they say.
How about some protein bars or protein shakes?
You're over 18, therefore you are considered a legal adult. Going to the doctor is highly confidential and they are not allowed to discuss your attendance with anyone without your permission, yes that includes your mother. You're safe.
You just call them up to make an appointment. Once you are 15 you can go on your own. Time to be an adult.
What's your age?
Is there a planned parenthood near you? Go there.
So i was walking with my friend the other day, and these two guys started making fun of him, so he said something about beating them up. As he doesnt appear to be a tough guy, they laughed it off. This drove him to later laugh hysterically and uncontrollably (sorry for my spelling) and while also crying uncontrallably. He continued to do this until he smashed his head against a brick wall and even then he was acting weird. He later told he was just about to murder the two people because he actually knows martial arts. He couldnt think straight, and it worries me, can someone tell what was wrong with him?
The information provided alone is not enough to pinpoint the exact problem he has (the behavior you described can be present in many mental disorders, but it absolutely sounds like he needs to see a psychologist. The behavior you described can be very dangerous, if he's a minor I would try to discuss it with his parents first as it doesn't seem like he is in the right state of mind to know whether he needs help or not. If it starts to seem like he really seriously intends to harm someone, call the police.
It was really you, wasn't it.... You could have just asked the question honestly but made it anonymous so no one would know it was you. Like anyone here actually uses their real name anyway (is that Mr Prinze?)... So you could have been anonymously anonymous. Or should that be.. you could be an anonymously anonymous anonymity? Wait! A nameless, anonymous, undisclosed, pseudonymous, fictional, whatchamacallit, anonymity... now I'm just confusing myself. You seem to be confused too if you think anyone here can diagnose you. Him.
Your penis probably has stopped growing, but has nothing to do with going to a gym. Exercising won't stop penis growth. But most guys are full adult size down there by 14-15 so likely done.
You dfo not exercise your penis at the gym! Your penis will stop growing when it has reached the size that it is genetically programmed to be. This will happen whether or not you use the gym. You still have a few more years of growing ahead of you. Please just ignore those who are ignorantly telling you that going to the gym will stunt your penile growth.
nope in fact more muscle will increase testosterone which may increase the size down there. The rest is hereditary and not reliant on whether or not you workout
not true. just choose the right workout and everything will be fine
Basically I have really skinny arms and don't understand why they won't get bigger? I am about 6ft tall 17 and only weigh 9 stone I have bin this weight for about 3 years I'm comfortable with my weight and my body but my arms are like twigs even when I put weight on its always my belly and my legs which I'm happy with people say it's my metabolism but it's just my arms, does anyone have any suggestions? Should I go to my doctors?
Do seated row, bicep curls, pushups and things like that to train your arms. Preferably train your whole body. You're slightly underweight for your age and height. Your arms do need training but you also need to eat more so that your body gets the building blocks to build your biceps. Eat at least three meals and one snack each day. Preferably include a protein source (eggs, meat, poultry, fish, legumes, dairy, nuts...) in each meal.
Do 100 push ups everyday. You'll see results. You just gotta do it. Do 4 sets of 25 push ups daily.
That's just your genetics.
because your 9 stone. get your weight up. you wont gain much mass if you have nothing to work with. you should try to get to 10-11 stone.
It's not a big deal he's just having fun. My sister used to do a lot worse than that to my penis.
Just be careful about ants. You really need a lot of patience to your bro. Hes strange i say and its natural to tease or make fun... Just deal with him
sounds like u have the issue. to place peanut butter like that you would have to be quite patient
LMAO. That's all I can say.
Whip his a**
...too funny
There is no question here. Write about it in your journal so you can tell your therapist. Many teens cut now. It's trendy and gets attention. So you are not alone and the therapist sees people daily who use this same poor coping mechanism. He or she will teach you new skills if you listen and do what you need to do. It takes some work. For now wrap up your wound and put the sharp object away.
I cutting too, woohoo cut bros for life!
what in God's name does cutting yourself do to help you?
Okay, I slept with this guy several times and every time he tells me he never c*m inside me. I am not on BC yet because my period is 4 days late now and tested negative for pregnancy. Yesterday he said he wanted to c*m inside, I could never tell if he really did it because his "thing" is way too big for a petite woman and when it ended I felt like his thing "went back to normal" and just like that it finished. I got up didn't use the toilet until 20 minutes later and I was dripping down there.
Sorry for TMI, I know it's irresponsible to have unprotected sex. We are not TTC atm but at the proper age to do so, but I don't want to offend him either if he really didn't. I asked him several times before but can't shake off the feeling that he is being dishonest. Could the ammonia smelling liquid from me? I have seen semen before but this liquid is a little too clear than normal but still smell of ammonia/bleach. Please stop being mean I am only trying to get help.
Well yeah, probably did more than once. You waited 20 minutes before getting up? Plenty of time for some semen to go inside your cervix and head for your egg. There is no miracle of life, getting pregnant is quite easy.
I can't say for certain but I was dripping and it's just clear but it smells of ammonia/bleach, could it be mine because he told me I was too wet? I am really getting worried because we are not TTC and I think he's just being an a*hole. I am about to start my BC as soon as I get my period but I am 4 days late.
Almost certainly, yes.
How could we possibly know that? Think!!
Only you can answer this and you should know if he did or not.
are you that stupid that you dont know ? if so i hope he never cos people like you should NOT breed
yep
Ummmm ask him?
You should tell him that there are other things that arent for him, but being a dad you should take it slowly and dont scare him. Tell him you understand him but you are his father and he should respect you... You should be concern at his state, he might be depress or having a trouble and this is the right time to talk to him man-to-man....
You have no son. You have no wife. Stopped trolling.
better than wan king to your photo
wow. Does he know its his mother? he should probably know because that's kind of weird. you should talk to him.
Yes or possibly no , but I think you are fibbing .
No, just give Thanks to Satan that he is normal. < M
No, that is not wrong. The truth is that everyone has topics that are off-limits for jokes. Some don't like to joke about marriage and divorce, death, getting old, having children, remaining child free, race, nationalism, sexual orientation, gender, height, hair, physical or mental disabilities, being rich, being poor, religion, dating, wearing apparel, living home with parents as an adult, leaving home early as a child, foster and adopted children, child abuse, sexual assault, and the list goes on and on. People's sensitivites are different and should be respected. Besides, that's what the golden rule says: "All things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them." - Matthew 7:12. Source(s): www.JW.org
There's a new science headed our way which might help out with these incurable things like obesity. It's the new science of the bugs which live in your gut - there's 100 TRILLION of them. And they determine a lot of what happens in your body. In time we'll be able to treat problems - For Real - instead of just talking about calories and exercise which don't work. Get "Brain Maker" off Amazon....... that's one book that speaks about this. So no need to joke........
Making a joke at someone's expense is unacceptable and everyone who really thinks about it will not find a valid reason to how it's acceptable .
yes it's wrong and unacceptable to do or talk about people in that way
Your height is determined by your genes. Girls stop growing at about 14, boys about 17.
No. Women stop round 15. Many before.
Wait
yes go stand in cows dung.
drink a lot of milk ! it worked for me
Violently masturbate every night.
are you male or female
If you have a prescription you can get many pain meds through the mail, but not narcotics. CVS pharmacy is probably the biggest mail-order pharmacy. Most of the prices from mail order pharmacies are not much different from Walgreens, Wlamart or local pharmacies. If you are looking to get pain meds without a prescription, don't waste your time with online sites. Any prescription pain med you find online that allows you to purchase it without a prescription is likely to be a scam.
Narcotics aren't available by mail. No schedule II drugs are. The strongest online medicine is probanly Imitrex, for migraine. Chronic pain meds are usually opioids, and thus considered schedule II. Too high a risk of addiction.
look up the dark web
no
Yes - good work. That medication is best left behind if possible. It can be really dangerous. There's a book out called "Medication Madness" about this stuff - and it really does makes some people loopy. I know there's advice in there about getting off the medication. So if you continue to have trouble, get a copy of that. Mostly........ just take whatever time you need - try not to get involved in terribly black thoughts. You're on the right track. And your body just has to get back to normal.
You should be talking to your doctor about this--whoever is prescribing this medication for you. You should never suddenly go off psychiatric medications, it can be very dangerous. Call the doctor and ask for help.
Pills aren't going to help, you need R and R
If a man is attacking you, it is fair that you pull out a knife or gun and end his life. So kicking him in the nuts would be a considerate thing to do.
Yes it's fair. When you are being attacked you are honing to do anything to protect yourself, woman or man.
if a man attacks a woman a guy should be happy that's all she does
Of course it's fair. If he's attacking you, you should do anything reasonable for self defence.
Totally perfect response.
If he is attacking you, why wouldn't it be fair? Define attacked.
If you are being attacked you do whatever you can to stop it.
if they attack hit them anywhere you can!
you ask that cinstantly
Dude, that's how I got started. You are going to get addicted to that **** and be one of those people who is always trying to ejaculate into their eyes.
Troll. Stop posting phony questions. There is nothing in semen that can possibly cause eye irritation.
you won't go blind and just keep your eye cleaned good
That's a pregnant phase....................

As a person who studies psychology, I can honestly tell you that there simply isn't enough information present to conclude on a finite answer. Out of all of the anxiety disorders, however, I would suggest that you look up 'generalized anxiety disorder'. You appear to have symptoms of that disorder (ie excessive worry, sweating, and abnormal heartbeat). Even if you yourself conclude that it's GAD, talk to an adult. Express your concern. Go to a therapist. If it does turn out you have GAD, do not worry. There are many medications that dull of symptoms. If it's not GAD, you just have high levels of anxiety. In that case, medication is still available along with therapy.
I don't know the truth that Masturbation can gives PE or not. But I personally asked few persons who is masturbating from the age of 12 to 18 now they are facing same problem like you.. So i think that's true because you have taught your mind to edaculate ealry and now don't have control on it. Just focus on other things while having sex not on your penis and her vagina..
I have ordered this Prolargent 5x5 Extreme 3 times and it has never failed once. Works as described. Very reliable.
I got my braces off about a month ago and I've had my retainer for maybe two weeks. I'm supposed to wear it 24/7, but it's a metal one that's for top and bottom. So uncomfortable. I'm afraid my teeth will shift if I don't wear it but it's so hard for me to wear. I have a bad gag reflex so I basically choke whenever wearing it. I try to wear it at least to bed but I can't sleep with it. Idk what to do!
If you don't wear your retainers, of course your teeth will shift. Maybe go to your orthodontist and tell them how bad it is and they can probably adjust them to be less uncomfortable.
I wear my retainer every night.
What I do for me is I just wear it when I am in bed and getting ready to go to bed and am on my phone, and then when I am going to bed, I take them out. I haven't worn mine for 2 months and they still fit.
I use to be able to write articulately. It always came so easy for me. NOW I can barely sign a Christmas Card. It's been this way for a few years. I miss writing. I always had an outstanding memory - but for the last 3 or 4 years my memory is worse than Alzheimer's. Is there anything I can do to stimulate my creativity again. I should mention the creativity seemed to go when I developed Fibromyalgia. I'm not in pain all the time so I don't think that is the cause. Is there anything I can do? Please only serious replies. Thanks
Only a dr. can diagnose and treat you. There are probably treatments and meds for fibro. To help your mind, work all the puzzles you can find. Thrift shops have jigsaw puzzles. pogo.com has lots of games that stimulate your mind and memory. Newspapers have crosswords and cryptograms. Exercise helps too and also a hobby.
Sometime we are not able to think proper because of weak or poor mental health. Impure mind cannot do such wonders or miracles. Only pure mind can venture. For this purpose you should always maintain perfect mental health conditions. Please don't be careless or negligent about your mental health.
Do you get sufficient sleep? Do you eat decently? Do you try to write?
You really need a dentist, see one ASAP. Gum disease usually makes your gums hurt to brush but try, the blood will come out and you'll need a lot of mints and mouthwash to get rid of the blood smell, same thing happened when my braces were put on.
You probably have gum disease. The same thing happend to my grandma. She had pretty teeth but ugly gums. Go to a dentist stat! Or maybe the hospital if nessacery. I hope u feel better!
Go see a dentist
Make an emergency appointment with your dentist asap.
Sounds like thrush. You need to see a dentist.
Go to dentist hurry!
Theres no age limit, i got braces at 24 and im a member of the Archwired braces forum, there are even members that are in their 50s and 60s with braces
Any age can wear braces. They are commonly used on children as the teeth are growing and easier to move, however adults can get them aswell. Hope this helps you! :)
I had my braces put on at age 50 one of the best things I ever did
You can get adult braces.
Yes we can, but it usually takes much, much longer for teeth be straightened as we get older.
Yes they can, and there is no age limit.
So I am a 17 year old girl. I thought that I was home alone so I got on my bed and started masturbating with my legs spread apart and my v***** facing the door. Turns out, my brother and his friend came home from the store early. They are about 21 and my brother is extremely protective of me. They walked in to see if I was awake yet because I had been sleeping when they left. They saw everything and my face turned beat red. I am so embarrassed. My brother pushed is friend out and then said "don't worry. Just keep doin what your doin" and then left. What should I do?
Well at least he didn't freak out. Next time lock your door. It will probably be hard to look him in the eyes from now on :P but you'll get over it and live to tell the tale. He handled it maturely so theres not much you can do besides ignoring it and acting like it never happened.
Its fine its normal to masturbate.
do nothing,, forget about it,, your brother know about the body needs,, he will not talked on this incident and you have to forget about that, to seems a bad dream.
keep doing what you are doing after you lock the door
The tip of my right nipple (the very tip point) sort of froze over several days that is it just felt hard like when a scab heals (but didn't hurt or bleed but just itched quite a bit) and today that part just fell off when I was scratching and that's it. Do you think it could be a sign of cancer and worth checking out?
No, it's not a sign of cancer. It's most likely just dry skin. Very common.
Pure imagination. Has nothing to do with cancer.
Apparently you haven't paid much attention in health class. Boys don't get periods.
Males do not have 'periods' as they don't have ovaries and monthly ejection of eggs. Only girls/women can have periods.
You should talk to your mother, who can explain to you, that BOYS don't get Periods.
Ridiculous troll story. Grow up kid.
guys don't get periods

foolish thing to do
MYTH. One research group that apparently had nothing to do checked out all the common myths re other body parts indicative of penis size. Hand size, foot size, distance from a finger to the palm, etc-- not one of those supposed indicators were true. What is true-- a bigger guy physically generally will have bigger gear-- most males are somewhat proportionate. So a big 6'5 guy will tend to have big feet and big hands, and generally a big penis too. But still no actual correlation to any body part.
x 2
Hand size has absolutely nothing to do with penis size.
Most likely a myth however there is some correlation between body parts.
Just a myth, my hand measures 7.2 inches but my erect penis is only 4 inches long.
No correlation... healthy-relationship-dating.com/penis-a...
For myself at lest, my hand is smaller, by an inch at least.
Nope... Hand is smaller
nope
I don't think legally people can deny your work due to a physical or mental illnesses, unless it would be impossible to do the job. I think you don't need to share with people your psychological diagnosis. Keep it private and do the best you can at the warehouse.
I take it you haven't been diagnosed with any of these..... Yes, you can be denied a job if you are unable to preform the basic tasks of the job.....
Hi, so I ve noticed that I usually feel dizzy with a bit of headache when eating mushrooms. I ve looked up the symptoms for mushroom allergy, and as far as I can tell, I don t really feel those. On gravy, or anything that has mushroom practically powder, I don t feel anything. So mushroom soups are alright for me. But anything with mushrooms that are whole, like example the whole mushrooms on gravy or mushroom soup, or even steamed mushrooms makes me feel dizzy. I m not really sure what it means, and I ve looked it up but found nothing. Is this just nothing?
Most likely all in your head. But if you'd like to be safe check with a doc. They are the only ones that can diagnose your issue which is most likely nothing but could be something.
No, nobody allergic with Mushroom, i think you ate the poisoned one, but don't worry it doesn't matter until you turn to be a beast next 3 days.
I need points
consult with doctor
No. Army is a ******* tough *** basic training. make you run 2-5 miles a day. You want to be in shape for them.. Run 2 miles in under 16 minutes be able to do at least 50 pushups and Situps in 1 minute. Be able to do at least 20 pullups at a time. Go to a MMA gym and get some techniques to try. Low Carb diet may be beneficial because the amount of **** you have to do is sugar burning.. the more time you give yourself on low carb the better off your **** will be. Trust me.
According to the site below, you are "almost" obese (185.5 lbs. is considered to be obese for a 5'6" guy): http://chadnorwood.com/2008/04/25/weight... Assuming that you are under the age of 20, the maximum weight to enlist in the Army is 160 lbs. (for the height of 66"). http://www.apft-standards.com/maleheight...
Yes 185 is too high for your height. Start eating clean and exercising and the weight should come off.
If your BMI (Body Mass Index) is over 30, then you are considered "obese." Overweight is a condition where the person weighs more than what is considered normal for that height, age and sex. http://www.diffen.com/difference/Obesity...
Female? Probably not obese but overweight. I'm about the same but I like how I am.
Does it matter wheather you technically fit that description? You should feel like your body is not an obstacle in your life, thats ecspecially true if you want to join the army.
Not obese, I'd put you in the very chunky category. And there is not one darn thing anyone of us can do. You have to lose weight and get in shape.
Your BMI is 29.8, and the threshold for obese is 30
Overweight. Lose 35-40 pounds you should be good. You can do it by mid september if you work hard :)
Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain is not producing sufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft. --- It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will become a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.--- Then find big happy churches, attend youth groups there and have fun. Remember, above all; God loves you more than you can possibly imagine.
Today, we went to church and I had a mild anxiety attack. My heartbeat was sped up and my palms sweaty, and my mom kept pointing out that I kept acting like I was anxious. Later, when I told them that I had a slight anxiety attack, they told me I was being over dramatic and that I shouldn't be anxious where we were. But I am socially awkward and can have anxiety when I go places, and I am never truly comfortable anywhere. Whenever I tell them I'm anxious they just roll their eyes, I wish I didn't have this but I do.
There are good books out there about combating anxiety. Go to an online bookstore and get a couple with high reader ratings. Also, learn basic relaxation meditation from free websites. Many people with anxiety get significant relief from meditation.
Parents don't seem to understand some mental "illnesses" as they are shocked their happy little child, isn't so happy. I'm sorry :( if you bring it up again perhaps in a very serious and long conversation they might understand better. If not, don't be shy to talk to a school counselor. I thought my guidance counselors at school were crappy but when I was depressed for awhile they actually helped me. I couldn't talk to my parents either because they laughed at me. I hope you all the best. Anxiety is rough but it is beatable.
sounds like a bummer. I have anxiety too. your parents should be more supportive but if they aren't just tell yourself that everything is going to be ok and you are a person worth caring about. if the panic gets worse, you might have to see a doctor. have you tried yoga? that can really help with managing panic. take care. so sorry you are going through this.
You ask this lame a** question every week, f*ck off.
Depends. Some times when we're nervous or upset we get fidgety and tend to scratch or cut ourselves. There are many form of self harm including scratching being one of them if your doing it for relief. If you feeling like you want to harm your self please call a help hotline. I personally recommend an elastic band around your wrist that you can snap when you feel the need instead of scratching. I hope you get better
Yes. It definitely counts as self harm. Using anything to harm oneself on purpose is indeed self harm. I'm so sorry to hear that you're going through a lot of emotional pain. Is there a counselor or trusted adult you could talk to? I hope everything gets better. Take care xx.
Yes, it does. Get help. A therapist will help you learn to deal with your emotions in more effective ways.
I'm joking seek help

Yes, it's normal. Every girl grows at different rates depending on genetics. When I was 13 I was smaller than you (aaa).
Yes, it's perfectly normal. I was a very thin little girl, and didn't need a bra till I was 15.
Yes it is normal.
Become a lesbian
masturbate ALOT or have sex will help alot
From a fellow 15 year old, 5 drinks is a bit much, tone it down to like 3
Alcohol is legal for adults for a reason. Your brain is still developing until about 20 years old. Getting repeatedly drunk at a young age can severely hurt your brain development, dude. This is could cause life long, permanent damage to you, as well as getting addicted. you're already binge drinking at 15!!
Stop being a tosser, you fool. There's a reason why the legal age in a lot of countries is in the 20s. Your brain is still maturing into the 20s, and alcohol can negatively affect your brain. And your other organs.
Of course it's bad, you need to drink water at least three times a day!
alcohol is a depressant so it is negatively affecting your brain. It will also eventually destroy your stomach, kidneys and liver. It is also illegal to drink under age 18. So whoever gives/sells this to you is in danger of being arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
Yes, it is bad for you, and also illegal. Five drinks is a lot for most people.
Yes.
Definitely. Average adult size is only 5.16 so good to go already. Most guys are done growing by 14-15.
Prolargentsize is an amazing product. Tried many others and nothing has worked like this stuff.
Huge for your age large for an adult.
See, you have done a mistake and now you are suffering from it. Now get tested and then forget about what has happened, learn from the mistake and don't do it again, because you have to suffer like now again (Not even with a condom). Have one trusted partner for sex even it may take time to find a one
Congrats for your first sex. Certainly some chance she could have had herpes and given it to you but less chance down there with a condom of catching anything.
50 / 50
Far less than catching Cold on a bus. < M
Pretty slim unless she had herpes.
If you start taking it at the start of your period (or within a few days of that) then you are protected straight away but you have to keep taking it carefully from then on. Take one per day at about the same time. The pill is very reliable but its not absolutely perfect and if you want to be extra safe use a condom or put in some spermicide as a second line of defence. You might find the guide below useful. The information on how to get the pill is specific to the UK.
first off birth control takes at least 30 days to be effective and 2nd you always use a condom no matter what even if you have been on birth control for months or years it will protect you and your partner and third you seem young and not well informed so if you re being pressured to do something your not ready for DON"T wait until you are emotionally ready for the responsibility it is not something to take lightly
No birth pills need to be administered according to the cycle. it will take at least one of your cycle for the pills to work. You need to take other methods of protections for tonight. Answer mine https://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20160514110203AALFKsj
NO! NEVER just rely on birth control!
NO READ the leaflet, it is several weeks before you are protected.
No it will not
so I'm 15 and I have a whole bush of pubic hair and it gets really itchy and I scratch it a lot. recently I've noticed my vagina has this white almost clear gel like substance that comes out at random times. like I feel like I'm on my period but it's just that stuff. is this normal ? is there something wrong with my vagina ?
It is normal to have hair and yes sometimes it does itch. Put conditioner of it and it will stop. All women have what we call a healthy discharge..yes. Very normal. A dry vagina is bad.
That's discharge. It's normal.
Try using conditioner. The discharge is normal and healthy
That's discharge. I get it; it's normal.
this is completely normal. happens to everyone
Usually your penis would only look 'child-like' if you shaved off all of your pubic hair.
Prolargentsize product is probably the best on the market for long lasting erections. If you can't keep it up then these are the ones for you. They helped me so they can probably help you to so if you or someone you know could use some help in the area then I suggest getting these or tell your friend or boyfriend or husband about these.
How do you know what the size of a child's penis is?
No worry , at proper time and place it will go ahead
Possible, but not likely. It's rare to beat heroin addiction even with professional help.
why don't you talk with me, i am a recovering heroin addict going on twenty three years clean and i used to crank heroin two times a day for seven months and i quit the stuff without no help at all
Yes, but it's not very likely. Pretending you can do it yourself is a common way of avoiding real help. Get real help.
-Yup. But it's One of the HARDEST Things You're Ever going to Do. :(

The same answer I've given for each and every one of your questions about patents. No. Read a patent application. Concerning your fixation with "farting" my children stopped finding farting funny when they were 6 years old.
Not if your plan is to use two human beings. They've been at that so long that there isn't anything new and patentable about sex. If you can think of it, humans have been doing it, for thousands of years before you.
Unlikely. There is absolutely nothing you can imagine that hasn't been done by someone else.
no
No.
ummmmm...................
For about 5 minutes before they collapse from heat stroke and die, I'm sure it feels quite unpleasant.
it would feel like a level 7 skin burn on humans
Painfully hot (water boils at 212°F).
Like your internal organs are liquid... I would assume.
Yep you nailed it at the end "I try very hard to let the thought go." You cannot entertain them even for a second, ever. You will get over this with practice and time. But you know how if you feel lovesick you want it to rain, you purposefully choose sad music, etc. That is no longer available to you. For your own well being, like you said this could affect the rest of your life, never endulge in self pity, negativity, remorse, guilt. Get strong, be positive about everything. I believe everything happens for a reason. If that is true, there can be no good or bad just what was required in order to advance the story.
As you can probably tell, a therapist isn't really much help. Tell a dr. about all this and ask for Zoloft. It is not crazy; it helps your brain to produce sufficient Seratonin. It will make you so much healthier and happier. It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it.
Despite what people say, you can lose weight without exercise. Controlling caloric intake is by far the most important factor in weight loss. So you can lose weight if you consume fewer calories than your body needs. Most people will lose weight, even without exercise, on a food plan of 1200 to 1500 calories a day. Moving more will of course help a little, but for the most part the calories burned through exercise are vastly exaggerated by websites and exercise machines. That doesn't mean that exercise isn't good for you - it is - but it is not the most significant factor in weight loss.
Exercise is the worse way to lose weight because exercise makes you even more hungry. But exercise is a great way to burn fat and gain muscle. The best way to lose weight is a healthy clean diet of non processed food and unnecessary liquid calories
Low carb diet. While you can lose weight without really exercising on that diet it's not really a smart choice. You'll also lose a lot more weight if you exercise.
This is a question typically asked by a lazy person. You want to lose weight by doing nothing? You put on weight by doing nothing so there is your first problem. You burn about 1,000 - 1,200 calories a day if you do nothing at all. Eat less is my only suggestion. But even if you are slim, laziness means you are unhealthy. Do something. Just walk around the block or up and down the stairs. Jog on the spot or get dumbbells and do weights. Lie on your back and move your legs in the air like you're riding a bike. Just DO something.
For millions and millions of years women used their fingers. Remember, your sex organ is your clitoris, not your vagina. Your vagina is for making babies and is largely numb. Your clitoris has only one function - sexual pleasure leading to orgasms. So rub over, around, on, squeeze, pinch, vibrate it and you will have incredible orgasms. There is no need for toys or putting something inside your vagina. The best toy you have is your brain. Fantasies play an especially large role in a woman's arousal and sexual satisfaction.
toy are actually the most safest thing to use seeing as they are made for the purpose of masturbation or self-pleasure. They are made so that they will not hurt you in any way ( cause rips or tears in the vag) anything that is not made for self-pleasure could potentially hurt you or cause infections.
the best way is to gently rub your clitoris to orgasm

Yes Self defense
It depends on what you mean by attacked. If you're being physically attacked then yes
If he's physically trying to attack you, you kick/punch/hit him anywhere you can to get away. He won't fight "fair" and neither should you.
Yes. And vice versa.
Are you point sparring or protecting your safety. Groin, throat, eyes, it's all fair game.
In self defense, sure. If he's just being mean to you, no.
perfectly acceptable to defend yourself by ANY means needed

So this guy made a suicide joke and it was so morbid I actually almost threw up. I've had crippling depression for many years and even some suicidal thoughts and attempts. He probably won't acknowledge it, so I need to catch him by surprise. A school dance is coming up, so maybe there? (I'm a short, unintimidating female)
Just let it slide. I know you've been through a lot, but you can't really stop anyone from doing and saying anything. Ignore him. People will always mock something that they've never endured. Maybe one day, he will know what it feels like. Don't get back at anyone, just mind your own business and carry on with your own life. Ignore people like him, people are people, and people will always hurt. Don't let them get to you.

You can't get wet and you're not a "Virginia" any more? In that case, maybe you should consider moving to West Virginia.
Your wetness is often related to your body fighting yeast, flushing itself out and your general hydration level. It does not mean you are deficient. Lube is a common solution. Try to get some "Wet" sugar free lube from a good drug store. It cleans up with water, wont stain the sheets and tastes good. (An important fact your BF will appreciate). Stay safe.
Most girls are like that their first time. It will hurt for like a bit but it continues to get better. Maybe use lube
Maybe you guys should do something before he inserts, like touching or something. If at then end nothing happens, then you should go to hospital.

Of course it is, women do it all of the time. When shlt liquids and fart juice comes out of that hole in between your butt cheeks over a prolonged period of time it leaves a stain on your butt hole. It's better to have white skin down there than brown.
Why go through with it, like what's the point :P. I'd say no
Are you planning on a large number of people looking at it?

Hopefully this is an English-as-a-second-language issue. If you're trying to ask what foods can and cannot be eaten with a particular medication, talk to your pharmacist. That's what they went to school for years to learn. Or, given that it's the Internet Age, such information is easily available online--just Google the medication. . If that's not what you're trying to ask, you'll have to do better than that. . Also, please pay attention to the category your questions land in, and use the Edit button to move them as needed. I fixed this one for you. . .
I was overdosed but ended up in emergency room almost died, they make you throw up all the pills, at home you can try drinking milk or water until the person throws up, nothing else you just wait sick until you feel better I guess maybe drinking water to clean your system.
unclear...ASK JESUS FOR GUIDANCE...and take an English course soon.
Just die, you fcuking troll!
Uh, what?
You got one thing right moron You're an E4 Because you sure as sh*t aren't a Corporal or an NCO
detox are all fake. but then you were asleep bc you got ill and were feeling faint and took some over the counter meds that knocked you out when they all got smoked so there's no intentional violation and you walk. .
so which part of ZERO tolerance wasn't clear to you? Perhaps they'll explain it to you again at your court martial and discharge.
Pick new buddies Pray
Yes they work
c'mon man,,, buddy's smoking what.. you failed man... you better shape up and get squared away first of all.... good luck.
A FREAKING JUNKIE MARINE ? JHC, you moron. I hope your bong breaks and you cut yourself and die from a staph infection.

This is true but on have to watch your portions. Like if you want to eat potato chips out can't finish a whole bag and lose weight Exercising is also a big part if you eat a lot of junk food but you exercise regularly you can still lose weight because you are burning off the calories
yes this statement is true if you exercise A LOT and burn more calories than you consume than you will lose weight eating what ever you want. The problem is most people DONT or CANT exercise enough to burn all the calories they consume plus more to lose weight; especially if their diet is crappy. if you burn 1500 caloies a day and consume 1500 calories a day you will remain the same weight if you burn 1500 calories a day and consume 1000 calories a day you will lose weight if you burn 1500 calories a day and consume 2500 calories a day you will gain weight
This Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea is amazing and by far the most effective pre work out supplement I've ever tried. It gives me a ton of energy to do a challenging work out and I feel uplifted for the rest of the day. I never feel discomfort or dizziness due to the caffeine levels and it relieves bloating. Great balance of ingredients .
I only smoke about 2 a day, sometimes I don't even smoke for a day. I don't consider myself as a regular smoker. I am on a 21-day birth control pill, not as a contraceptive, but to regulate my periods and reduce acne (I am diagnosed with polycystic ovaries). I'm 17. Are there dangers of smoking and being on the pill. If there are harmful ones rather than the usual dangers of smoking that I am aware of, I will stop.
doctors will tell you that smoking and birth control pills can cause blood problems that causes clots.. which can be very dangerous.
I assume your asking because you were in shop class. The answer is no. The government has strict regulations of what can be taught in school and anything dangerous to your health would not be allowed.
Hypochondriac is all you suffer from. Jesus Christ worked in wood. Abe Lincoln Ben Franklin ...wood has bee around longer than humans and no you won't get ocpd from building a birdhouse.
It depends. Do you have any constipation problem. Because, in between, you should not ask for permission to go to the toilet.
wood shop is awesome....I took 4yrs of it , 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th grades.....no ill effects from it
Only if you sniff the glue. < M
Hello so when I was 12 I've gone on a diet for almost 3 months and it was a starvation diet (600-800 cals a day) where I would eat fruits for most of my meals, I've noticed that I am now shorter than most girls my age but when I was about 11 I was taller than most girls at my class, most of the girls already have gotten their period in my class, but I didn't though.
"Does dieting stunt growth?" Dieting does NOT stunt the growth. Also three months wasn't long enough, to have any affect on your growth while you were dieting. Genetics is the number one factor in your growth. Also you NEED at least fifteen hundred calories a day, if you're extremely sedentary. That's the bottom line. At your current age though, you should at the very least be eating closer to seventeen hundred calories a day. The farther below the fifteen hundred calories you drop the harder it becomes to get all of the required nutrients to be healthy.
Extreme dieting might if it went on long enough around the time you should have hit puberty, but you aren't talking about huge amounts here, maybe an inch. I'd be worried more about effects on your bones and internal organs and future ability to have a family, all of which might have been affected.
Okay I am 13 and a friend of mine is super sporty does netball every day and eats well and still doesn't have her period! I think you should definitely start eating more instead of a diet like this start doing a daily 30min workout and eat healthily but often. Don't starve yourself not worth it. You will get skin problems and tiredness as you will not have enough vitamins.
Yes. I did the exact same thing and lost my period. Sad thing is, starving yourself isn't the right way to lose weight.
Very unlikely.
Curse of being male. Seriously though, our hormones especially when in the early to mid teens are raging and all physical reaction to hormonal levels. So makes it difficult to control random raging hard ons.
Random erections, those that happen with no sexual stimulation... is just your body making sure everything works fine, which is why they happen most frequently among those who are still in puberty. While in puberty, the body is still growing and changing, sometimes the body tests things out to see if they are working right. While they still happen to adults on occasion, they do not happen as often.
Mostly due to hormone levels. Random erections decrease as you get older.
Because we do, that's the way it is. You don't have to live your life around it.
Try seeing if you can read signs from far away. Keep an eye out if it's your vision. I had to get glasses, and if it's not that then keep seeing a doctor about it. You could have a sign of allergy or something that's bugging you. May God bless you with help!
Go back to the doctor, and tell him again until he listens.
There are a few of us. I try to give helpful answers with hints on where to go for more information. Sometimes, though, some of the questions have such self evident answers that I can't resist giving a humorous or wise-a** answers.
Yes, there are. I have answered many people's real medical questions. My advice usually ends with "see your doctor." I think that's the best advice a stranger on the Internet can give. I ignore the numerous childish posts in that hope that, if you ignore them, then they'll go away.
well i am on here and i am grown up
it never fails, every single time I get my period, I just get diarrhea. I was wondering if this happens to anyone else and if it's normal or if there's something wrong with me. I haven't been to the doctors about it because it didn't seem like a big deal but now it's starting to concern me.. it's not like my stomach hurts or anything. just normal cramps.
I used to do that too.. not with every period but most of the time. When we are getting our period, lots of changes are going on inside our bodies.. inflammation, pain etc. I think this is normal for some of us. It was for me. I was never concerned about it, but it was annoying, i'll give you that.
It's very normal. My bowels always act up on my period. Your intestines are cramping and your muscles spasm, so it's causing the contents of your intestines to move through you quicker, causing diarrhea.
It sounds like a hemorrhoid. This is an inflamed vein in the anal area. Sometimes when somebody has diarrhea or constipation, or other stress to the anal area, a hemorrhoid will break and bleed. It is basically harmless. In some people, it gets itchy or painful, and there are things you can do to soothe it or prevent it from happening. But it is not anything to worry about. However, if you mention it to your doctor, they will probably want to send you for a colonoscopy to make sure you don't have cancer. Bleeding from the rectum is one of the signs of bowel cancer. There are other possibilities too. But most likely it is a hemorrhoid.
Probably just an anal fissure. This is a common problem in all guys. It usually occurs during the winter months when you don't drink as much water but can occur anytime. Your stool gets hard and rips you a new one. Happened to me once. I overreacted and thought I was dying of a cancerous tumor that was bleeding out of my butt.
most likely causes: A) a huge firm turd b) anal sex c) hemorrhoid d) wiping too hard or with rough objects. a bright red stain typically indicates colon/anus bleeding. In most cases, unless your turds are flecked with visible red blood it's nothing to worry about although you should avoid the causes. or if your turds are black and and "tar (or sludge)-like". in either case where stools are visible bloody you need to see a doc asap. in the case it's just on the tp, don't worry.
9 times out of 10 it's hemorrhoids, or if you're constipated it can cause occasional anal bleeding bc the stool is bigger and harder than usual ans has the tendency of stretching your anus causing the skin tissue to rip open a bit.
Probably nothing more than hemorrhoids. Buy some Preparation H and smear it on your butt.
You are not alone mate. I know how you feel. I think i have it like once a month. (I am not talking about menstruation as i am a guy)
Did you experience a pounding sensation in your AssWhole in the last 24 hours? Tell your Fireman you want him to grease his pole before he has you slide down it.
As you post in politics I conclude your a troll.
possibly hemorrhoids, see a doctor
You pushed too hard. Eat more veggies
I've been running for years but suddenly I started breaking out in hives, face became swollen and started fainting and losing consciousness. I would lay there on the trail unable to move or see for an hour. Then all of a sudden, hives would disappear and I would return to normal. This only happens at night after I've had a large dinner. Is this normal or a sign of something serious?
No, unexplained fainting is not normal. I'd talk to your doctor about this soon.
It sounds like you might be allergic to something you are eating in your dinner, or perhaps to pollen of a plant that you are running by.
It sounds like a serious allergic reaction.
I think you know that's not normal.
no
Probably not going to reach your dad's height, although you might still have a late puberty growth spirt since that in your family's genetic history.
Men stop round 16. Your father is below average but your mother is very short.
you cant say, my =friend was 5.4 all through school when he turned 18 he shot up to 5ft 10
maybe, drink lots of milk
shorty mom is holding you back
Oh geez.... how can onyone on here possibly know that?
That's normal size for your age. Most of the penis growth takes place between age 14 and 16. So get ready.
It's normal for you.
Your fine. Everyone enters puberty and grows and develops in their own time and way. You can continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties.
it's fine for your age
Maybe yes - maybe no. Time will tell... healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Are you like others yes. Are you big yes. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some degree. You will continue to grow until your in your late teens to early twenties.
About that size at your age, grew to 6.5 by 14. Average adult size is only 5.16 so good to go already. Most guys are done growing by 14-15.
Prolargentsize is a good supplement for men. Unsure of the male enhancement properties.
That is pretty good for a 15 year old. < M
In America- 100%
It's a pretty high percentage. A few of them are prostitutes or other types of sex workers. A few are actresses and pop stars who succeed based on their implied sex appeal. A few are executives who slept their way to the top. The majority, however, are housewives. Their husbands work long hours to bring home the paycheck and they provide them with sex. In doing so these women receive a roof over their heads and other gifts such as jewellery.
About 80%
Well.. I'm a guy,, I think earning money by having sex (regardless if it's one male or 100 males) is very sad...However, I think is sadder if a man pays for sex...I wish us men could defeat this evil of lust! *yes, i know.. "not all men suffer from lust") God bless you.
Nobody knows. Think of all the sex traffic workers whose money goes straight to the people who kidnapped them and sell them to men who only care about one thing. Very sad and scary for human beings to be like this.
100%
less than 1%
90%.
enough - 1% So... never enough.
127 pounds would be fine if you were very tall but 5 foot 3 is short so you should weigh less. It's not normal for your height and age. It's caused by overeating.
It's pretty normal seeing you're 13 and still growing. I wouldn't worry too much about it, if you're really that worried you could talk to a doctor I bet they could give better advice or help better then strangers on here :/
Its just fine. Some children grow earlier and faster than others. Its all about puberty, its occurs earlier in some children and also occurs little late in some. You don't need to worry
i'm a 110 pounds and i wish weighed the same as you! i think you're perfectly normal
This question is easiest to answer by looking at pictures and comparing to yourself: http://genesis-fertility.com/wellness-we... Note: The thinnest body weights are rarely what guys find "optimally" attractive. In the linked chart, "C" is probably the optimal appearance. "D" and "B" are acceptable. Anything outside these ranges are undesirable. A better chart: https://fatshionelle.wordpress.com/2012/...
Your best weight is 105-110 lbs.
Naaaah you're totally fine!!!! You're body sounds PERFECT at that weight~! Trust meee :))
It is normal for your age. You are fine.

Congrats on the weight loss, you will be getting attention from the opposite sex all Summer long. TBH you did yourself a favor by being so strict. The only advice I would give you is to NOT feel guilty about cheat meals. Eating well and being fit is a LIFETIME journey. It get's a lot harder to do so when you age, have more responsibility and more stress. Just be mindful of what you eat daily. Keep a food log if need be. Make sure you workout 5-6 days a week for at least 30 minutes.
After a while, you'll naturally become less vigilant. Allow time for that, and develop a maintenance plan.
then eat MORE chicken and veggies with a little bread and milk
Don't inhale bleach, that's not really the best idea ever
Get some fresh air and see a doctor if it doesn't improve. Bleach fumes damages the respiratory system.
quit inhaling bleach. why are you doing that?
You should ring the poison hotline as bleach is very toxic, they should be able to guide you :)
stop inhaling it
I think you should really go to the doctors
-Try drinking MORE Water. Excessive itchiness is often a Sign of Dehydration. :o
Chances are you're showing with hard hot water. It washes off your body oils something fierce. Be sure to use a good moisturizing lotion afterwards.
Maybe you are allergic to your soap or shampoo? Try changing it and see if that helps.
classic problem with dry skin. use one of the many creams that helps with dry skin.
for me, it's Jennifer Lawrence Mmm

Last year I lost the weight that I gained in winter time.One of my co worker congradulated me and said I look great and not to lose anymore.However, now almost every time I see her she always makes a refrence to my weight and tells me that I'm getting too skiny.She says this every time she sees me which is maybe few times a month as we work opposite shifts.Today she was like"you're getting too skinny! you're going to break!t's starting to get to me. Next time I'm thinking to pull her aside and let ask her to refrain from further comments on my body .thoughts?
Rather than wait until the next "incident," find a time soon where you can calmly tel her something like this... "Lisa, I know you mean well, but honestly, your comments about me getting too thin are getting old and I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop. My doctor and I are monitoring my weight and I am healthy." If you are getting too thin, aren't under the care of a physician, or something else is going on, get help.
She maybe joking. Some people feel good when people tell them they look too skinny. I have a co worker who was obsessed with her weight loss even being severely underweight. If anyone mentioned her being skinny, she would like it. Perhaps she thought as well it was something you would like to hear.
Shes jelly fam u got a 20 inch waist an she wannit reel bahd
Do not 'confront', but ask her respectfully not to keep talking about your weight.
Tell her she is making you uncomfortable. You need to draw your boundaries.
I've had this pain in my knees for around 2-3 years. My parents thought it was growing pains but surely it would have gone by now! My left knee hurts more going up and down stairs, and sometimes I get a very sharp pain in my right knee in the same place each time. This is not a sports injury, I'm sure. Also, both my knees turn in A LOT (my right turns in more than my left). When I do running they hurt so much, it's so frustrating! What's wrong with me?? Does anyone know what this could be? Would you think that stretching would help? Thanks for helping me!!
It sounds like TMS to me, which is good news because it means you can end your pain yourself. Also, regarding your knees 'turning in'? It sounds to me like you are actually internally rotating your HIPS in, which would cause your knees to rotate in. Practice running with your hips more outwardly rotated, and I'll be your legs will line up just fine. Watch the following video about TMS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsR4wydi... ONE MORE THING: Go to youtube.com, look up 'Feldenkrais' and do a couple of Feldenkrais movement activities you find there. [Don't just watch them--DO them!] Feldenkrais lines up the skeleton through the central nervous system. It's extraordinary stuff.
Yu need a sports injury physician. Running will hurt knee's. I know family members who've run the Honolulu Marathon many times when they were younger who are paying with pain daily. It does happen a lot. You'll need to get a MRI as well.
Hi I'm 13 turning 14 next month and I am 5ft9 or 5ft10 my dad is 5ft7 and my mom is 5ft and my brother 5ft11 and he's 16. On My moms side of the family she has some tall brothers one about 6ft5 and she says I probably got a lot of genes from my grandmother which her family is all tall. In height and CDC growth charts it predicts me to become 6ft4 or 6ft5. Is it possible that I inherited this tall gene?
Yes you are still growing, only 13. Question is if your brother is still growing- if he is you can use his growth history as a guide for how yours will be. May not be the same size at the end but development to final height should be very similar.
Just do to your age it would be easy to assume that you are still growing. But we have no way of knowing that. We know nothing about you. There is no possible way we can know how tall your going to be.
Yes, you are still growing and it is very possible that you inherited this gene from your grandmother.
"Liberals" or "conservatives" don't really care about funding abortion clinics, one way or the other. The whole abortion/Planned Parenthood thing is just a political ploy to divert voters' attention from the REAL problems in this country. When the national election is over, that's the last you are going to hear about it for the next 4 years. Every 4 years, the two political parties take the abortion issue off the shelf, dust it off, and use it to get the voters all upset and in an uproar. Then, when the election is over, they put it back on the shelf, and that's where it remains for the next 4 years.
It's not just liberals who support funding, it's anyone with common sense. Abortion clinics - or as the rest of us call them: family planning clinics - provide vital healthcare services to citizens including STD screening, birth control, abortion, hormonal treatments, fertility treatments, cancer screenings, and sex education. These services are a huge economic benefit to the country as well as help maintain the health and defend the rights of citizens.
Because they provide health services for women.
Like Sanger and her protege Hillary it is all about killing off minority kids.
They just mindlessly do what theyre told
planned parenthood saved my moms life with early cancer screening .
I think you should. There's no harm in starting early, especially if it'll make her a more confident person
Sure, but just let her know that females are NOT required to shave. And as for shaving being more hygienic the opposite is actually true.
Why wouldn't you let her? It's her body and if she needs/wants to she should be allowed to
Theres no harm in letting her do so especially if she is starting to grow hair.
Yes, definitely!! Teach her how to have a good hygiene!!!
I don't think it will hurt her any.
It's a question that theology, philosophy and psychiatry addresses. You have to process your envy and contempt to grow as a better human being. Its not unusual so don't worry.
By mediating deeply on the positives in your life. It really does work, because I get this too often for my liking and yesterday, felt it horribly and because it makes me feel just awful, I made myself reason on things and soon felt much better.
I don't have any. Stop thinking you have control. There is no good or bad, just what is required.
i do it by asking god why caring is important and when i get it i focus on it.

I'm 17, and am obese, I'm losing weight, and am currently 40 pounds down, and am starting to see more of my penis when i'm erect. I'm really thin at the tip, and progressively get thicker as it gets toward the base. At it's thickest it is just over 5" in girth. and is 5.5-6" long, I think thats a decent size, But it looks so weird. When I decide to have sex will it feel bad for the girl I'm with? Any insight would be appreciated.
It is actually a bit better for sex if you are more narrow at the tip. If you were too wide, it would be painful for the woman. They don't like to be ripped open you know.
your penis sounds perfectly fine to me.
Decent size. Penises look all ways. Not really a big issue.
You ask that girl. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Gene Roddenberry, the creator of Star Trek was an atheist. Brannon Braga said that Roddenberry made it known to the writers of Star Trek and Star Trek: The Next Generation that religion, superstition, and mystical thinking were not to be included.

And?
Went into WHsmiths to pick up a compass, because my maths teacher asked me to get one for the next day, and they wouldn't let me have a COMPASS?! I'm 14, I'm old enough to know compasses have sharp points. If I wanted to self-harm, or stab someone I would find a lot better ways than a compass ffs. This is health and safety gone batsh¡t crazy.... Btw I am in the uk before anyone asks what stupid country has that law.
Pairs of compasses [that's what they're called] are not age restricted, the sales assistant got it wrong. WHSmiths won't sell age restricted items online, for obvious reasons, and they sell pairs of compasses on their webpage. I was once banned from buying water based glue by a clueless assistant.
Put some make up on and look like a 16 year old - Kim
U sound just like a child.. LAWS are there to protect unintelligent ( stupid acting) people. Don't like the LAW ? U can Thank some child WHO impaled them self or stabbed to death a friend. If u think that LAW is tough. Just wait till u adult . GOT plenty of one's u really will not enjoy. Welcome to reality. Parents can buy it for you

well, American 14 year olds could buy a compass, that does seem like a stupid law. You use them for school.
Sociologist Ulrich Beck mentions about risk culture. Everything we fear today is due to the human made concept of risk and precaution. Ever since 9/11, Americans have been a lot more afraid. Now I am not sure if Cruz and Trump do advocate war crimes because I'm not from the US, but I believe that people have voted for them because of the risk factor. It is us against them. We have to defend and fight. We will never know if the civilians are actually undercover agents. Collateral damage must be performed to petrify the enemy etc.
No, that's republicans you are talking about. That's what they like.
Do you have a shred of evidence to support your obvious lies and bullsh*t?
War is good.
Actually not really when you consider they(GOP base) have the same superior mentality the Nazis did!
oh no, not war crimes. land sakes

no they didn't.
Nope. When I was dieting I always had one "cheat day" a week where I ate whatever and I still lost a ton of weight. Most dietitians and personal trainers will tell you to have one cheat day or cheat meal a week.
Yes. There's no reason to be a complete slug once a week.
If you do that you could regain the weight you lost in the previous 6 days.
Nope. It's acutally keeps u sane
No! If your body tells you it is hungry, listen to it. I regret not doing so. Do NOT count calories. Just eat (HEALTHY FOOD), whenever you want to. Your body will use all of this energy for your development. You might need more food than others because you're probably more active than them. Maybe, even, your metabolic rate might be faster than that of others'.
I would recommend having ONE of those options for breakfast, not both.
No, eat until you aren't hungry
no, not at all.
So here's the thing, I just got my results from the optometrist a few hours back and it says that I have an eye grade of +2.25 and I'll be needing glasses. In the meantime, I found this old pair of eye glasses (reading glasses I assume) and when I wore them, my vision instantly improved. I was wondering, If I wore those, will they damage my vision more?
They won't " damage" your vision, but ready made reading glasses don't have very good quality lenses in them and the optical centers are almost certainly not at the correct placement for you either so those lenses won't be as comfortable for you to look through for long periods. You would notice a difference in visual comfort with glasses made specifically for you.
mom asks that everytime we go to the doctors. ur vision usually changes til ur liek 20 ish. then it slows down. mine changed hioribly an mom thought it was glasses causing it. but they are stopping that trend now and mom finally listens. glasses dont change ur eyes. thats wht we keep hearing
If you have farsightedness, +2.25, with no astigmatism, then reading glasses of that diopter power should work fine.
ASK A QUALIFIED MEDICAL PERSON! YA USERS WILL ONLY CONFUSE YOU! Most wont qualified to be able to give you a fully correct answer (unless it's a quoate from a qualified person). Again, only a doctor/therapist/councellor etc. can give you proper help that you would need if you had a social anxiety disorder. I have an acute anxiety disorder. Part of it is with social anxiety. There's many forms of anxiety.
Tell a dr. how you feel and ask for help. There are good meds for anxiety.
Talk to people

You are maybe lying because you are 13 and you have 75 kg , are you mad kid? I am 24 and i have 87 kg and i look like athlete.Second , are you fat cause you are short , 5`1 with that weight? So you possibly lied about you wang size to , i mean wtf 7 inches 13 year old , i am 24 and i have 7 inches you mad?
Big. Less than 5% are 7 inches- adult males, that is.

No - I often make up a soup or something and eat that all day. Sometimes have some left over something from the day before.

Nah... More like 2 & 1/4. :)
It depends how much weight you have now. If you are a very obese being then you could loose quite a lot. But if you are an anorexic being (which I know you're not) then you would barely lose anything. Also let me tell you that when you stop eating, your body wants to save all the fat and insulation it can for survival purposes. The best way to lose weight would be to work out.
Sounds like something I did a few years ago. I lost 15 pounds in less than 2 months. But of course, when you reach your goal, add healthy proteins to your diet or your hair might start to fall out. Seen it happen.
Those better be some fatass bowls of oatmeal. Not eating well can also cause you to gain weight
Depends on metabolism. And you need to add regular exercise to that regimen.
You are not understanding it. Lack of sleep cannot be countered by energy boosters. It's your MIND that is fatigued and no energy booster (organic, natural, or whatever) is going to fix it. The ONLY thing that will fix mental fatigue is SLEEP.

No. 13 is far too young. Wait till you're 16.
Hot potato question. Some 13 year olds do have sex sucessfully to answer your question. It obviously depends on the 13 year olds. It is illegal in the U.S.A. for 13 to have sex, and many countries in Europe. O.K. in Portugal and Sweden and Vatican, I think. The main concern is you having babies, rather than it doing you any harm. < M
It is not something you should be doing until you are a bit more mature and know what sex is all about. It is not the same as masturbating. You are involving another person and that can greatly complicate it.
Yea it's normal have fun
Do you live in Mexico?
It's illegal... and you may get her pregnant, even if you use a condom (they sometimes break).
No
it is okay for boys but not girls
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
So I'm 16, but I can't eat anything with the slightest bit of fat in thinking that I'm gonna die from clogged arteries. Every time I eat I just picture it. I'm so scared. I never want it to happen. I don't have a history of heart disease in my family but with the western diet it's gonna lead to mayhem lol.
Just keep on telling ur self that's not what's going to happen, coz its not💜
This is OCD or anxiety. you should see a doctor, counselor, therapist.
Nicotine, just by itself, is not necessarily harmful - other than the fact that it is psychologically and physically addictive. Nicotine is found in the nightshade family of plants and is a stimulant drug. What makes cigarettes dangerous is not from the nicotine that tobacco contains. The danger comes from the hot tars you inhale, that are produced by the burning paper that the cigarette is wrapped in.
"Is nicotine all by itself bad for you? I know smoking cigarettes causes cancer but i'm talking about nicotine all by itself?" "BTW I'm asking this because i'm writing a paper. Not cause I "vape." " Yes, it is bad for you. Nicotine in humans is a nerve toxin. Nature uses nicotine lots of places, as part of its "lure". For example, honeysuckle produces some nicotine, and the bees love it.
Absolutely! Nioctine is a stimulant that speeds up your nervous and cardiovascular systems. With continued use nicotine causes all kinds of heart disease (the number one cause of death in America). Not to mention it affects some transmitters in your brain and causes one of the hardest addictions to break.
Nicotine is a poison but is completely harmless at the levels of cigarettes.
Nicotine doesn't cause cancer. It temporarily constricts blood vessels, increases heart rate and bp.
Sounds like trying to rationalize smoking to me!
No its not that bad. This video mentions alot of sources you can use for your paper. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmPL0ldKoz4 Links and studies of actual safety: http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/05/05/e-cigarettes-fda-congress-smokers-editorials-debates/83983326/ https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/projects/outputs/nicotine-without-smoke-tobacco-harm-reduction-0
Yes it is bad for you.
Yes it is. It is a highly addictive neuro toxin. It c auses numerous health problems. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles...
no
If your drinking interferes with your life, you might put yourself in the category of being an alcoholic. Excessive drinking on weekends is hard on your body, but if you don't care about potential problems later in your life, then that is your choice to make.
if all you think about is your next drink than your an alcoholic and you either get help or stop on your own
If you have to ask the question, it is likely that you are an alcoholic. People who are NOT alcoholic KNOW they are not alcoholic.
sounds like Binge drinking, may be
No MA'AM your just a retard
Not really...
Okay so I am pretty sure that my stuff isn't laced because all my friends smoke a lot and they have a chill time , they go to mcdonalds, hookah bars after smoking weed but I just start tripping and see trails and colors like I am in a movie and I just can't walk because my legs literally become like jelly. What can I do? What's happening? Am I too sensitive to THC?
You might be sensitive. You could try a different type that doesn't do that. There are types like "Charlotte's Web", that don't have any thc. An Indica type might be more your style, rather than a sativa type. Sativa's can be very strong and cause, "couch lock". Whereas an Indica can be more uplifting and active. Or you could just pass. Contrary to belief, no one will care if you don't smoke. Or just take one puff, instead of many. One puff is probably enough anyway. And a joint, is way too much for one person. Be safe, and don't drive while stoned.
Some people can't take it. It isn't for everybody.
Lucky, sounds like you're smoking it right to me
Bright red blood is usually ok, especially if you get no other symptoms, probably hemorrhoids or anal fissure. Food can also cause this. There could be other causes, I get red blood quite frequently, had a colonoscopy a year ago and signs of inflammation and bleeding were found on my sigmoid colon wall, which was a likely cause of my bleeding, this is still under investigation. There is also the chance of an Anal fistula, however the bleeding is usually accompanied with mucus or pus. If it only happens now and again, don't worry about it, but if it is a regular occurrence, get it checked out.
If it was bright red like blood then it is penalty hemorrhoids. You should increase your fiber intake and also drink more water. And don't sit on the toilet using your phone. That makes them worse.
If it was bright, red blood, It could be hemorrhoids, which is benign. Usually, there is pain relief after a hemorrhoid bursts. It also could be something you ate. Beets can make stools red if you have eaten a lot.
Gross
Nope. Diet Pills are Baloney. You may have 'Tried everything" but have you ever tried the "If it's White, don't Bite" Diet? Avoid white flour, white sugar products, white rice, and white potatoes. Enjoy Whole Grains, Protein, Vegetables, fruit, and low fat dairy. I lost 20 pounds this way, and even eat ice cream. 1/2 cup of Turkey Hill Slow Churned Ice Cream. Delicious and satisfying.
yes,you can use diet pills but you should try to lose weight naturally by doing exercise and by taking a good balanced diet because it doesn't have any side effects.
I really needed to lose Weight I’m approaching my 32th birthday and I have noticed thats its getting harder and harder to lose Weight. I was desperate because I could no longer fit into my cute clothes and fat pants are just not for me! I just started “ Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea ” Tea its only been two weeks and already five pounds down and it tastes great!!! Thanks Weight Loss Green Store Tea product Tea .
You're a spammer
Sure.
no
No.
you cannot be pregnant if you're a virgin so get pregnancy out of the way. it's actually very normal to have irregular periods or a missed period. my periods are usually regular and I missed a month before and j was freaking out even when I'm a virgin, just like you are! later I found out that periods can be delayed or affected by many factors like stress, weight loss/gain, change in sleeping patterns, hormones, etc.. and many women have irregular or have missed periods before! don't stress about it too much, that'll delay your period even more.
It's not anything to worry about. This sort of thing is actually much more common than you might think. Most irregular periods are not anything to worry about. Missed periods, too frequent periods, spotting, light periods, or bouts of heavy clotting and bleeding are usually caused by an underlying hormonal imbalance that is easily treated. Many factors can contribute to such irregularities. Do a google search for “period irregularities” and you will find lots of information.
It's a sign your period is late.
Your body is not a machine that does the same thing over and over and over. Things like stress, body weight, medicines and medical issues like PCOS can cause a delay. If you miss 3 peiods in a row, see your doctor. 3 days late is nothing to worry about.
A female's monthly period has NOTHING to do with her virginity.
Its perfectly normal. Your body is growing and changing. One time i was 2 n a half weeks late and i got so freaked out. But you'll be okay, I promise ^.^
You are fine. It is impossible for you to be pregnant unless semen has somehow reached the vaginal opening. It is common for young girls' periods to be irregular. You'll be fine, it will come eventually.
No its fine dw mine was 8weeks late ones it will come have baths and relax good luck!😊
don't worry, it is just going to explode when you sneeze
Is it a sign of WHAT???
At 13 you are producing sperm. Just not ejaculating yet since you have not found the right level of stimulation. go slow, go easy, and focus on your self pleasure and avoid watching porn when masturbating. You ejaculate semen-- of which sperm is only a tiny portion. But normal to masturbate from the onset of puberty- most guys start at 11 or 12.
Same answer I gave you before. I had wet dreams @ 13, but no actual c*m till I was 14. It's genetics. Just be patient.
Average age of ejaculation is 13.6 years. You should be able to dry orgasm by now. < M
it is because you are 13!. and not too smart too, almost for the present...
Lol I sometimes think like that. As long as you never follow through and it's really only for fun in your head, you're fine. :) Lol This made me laugh.
It's normal. Just be careful not to get caught if you act on these feelings. Them àssholes try really hard to catch killers for some reason. It's not like humans aren't overpopulated or something.
That question reminds me of a video by danisnotonfire called PSYCHO THOUGHTS. I think you should check it out. As for that, I'm not sure.
There is no average for an 11 year old because it depends on how tall you are. Some 11 year old children are only 4'6" tall while others could be 5'6" tall, so it really varies a great deal. Don't worry about your weight. Be strong and fit and healthy.
Wow Hun, you really shouldn't be concerned about your weight at such a young age! Enjoy your life! But you sound a perfect weight for your age
At 11 years old it doesn't matter.
85-100 pounds? Depends on height too.
Everyone is different.
Im 14 years old. I wouldnt say im flat chested but i wear a 32 a. I have small boobs and i really want big boobs. Not gigantic but pretty big. I want to get big boobs fast without getting plastic surgery. Im not gonna get it when im older either. I want to get bigger boobs in a healthy way and without gaining weight cuz im a little skinny and dont want to gain weight. Only answers from girls please otherwise that would be creepy. Thanks for the answers
Eat foods that contain plenty of estrogen. Foods like dried fruits, chicken, chickpeas, soy milk, and things like that. Also, do exercises like pushups, dumbbell lifts, really anything that strengthens the pectoral muscles. If nothing works, you can try padded bras, pushup bras, or breast contouring. In all honesty though, you probably look great. There's a lot of perks to having small breasts, but it's your decision. I don't have a right to question it. Just remember, enlarging your breasts is easier than making them smaller, so don't go overboard if you really want bigger breasts, because its almost like a one way street.
If you are meant tonhave bigger boobs, they will grow when your body is ready. You are still a CHILD, so it is unrealistic to expect tour body to be in a full adult shape for several more years. Aside from waiting for your body to mature, the only "natural" ways to get bigger boobs is weight gain or pregnancy
Always on going. Never stops. Accredited Music Therapists hold degrees in music, psychology and sometimes teaching.
I picture Jesus playing a wild Saxophone and the Romans saying, 'We'd better let this guy live'.

Because they don't want to hurt loved ones and might feel as if it's their problem to deal with and get through by themselves. They may not want to feel judged and might feel that if they tell a loved one, they'll just turn their back on them or be hated.
Fear of judgement and rejection and that disgust in their eyes... They judge themselves more than anyone could judge them, so to a loved one look at you with digust and judgement is like a nail in the coffin. Embarrassment too. They're not always ready to give it up and loved ones expect you to and expect it to be easy when in fact it's painful and it's the reason behind the using that needs sorting.
Are you really too stupid to figure this out? What would your reaction have been? Do you know what addiction is?
because they don;t want to hear about quitting or rehab
You're not pregnant. There is no possible way you can get pregnant without sperm getting inside you, and that's not going to happen from masturbating with the shower head. Never in a million years. I think you're just getting cramps because your period is soon (i.e. it's PMS). Or maybe you're just unwell for another reason. But you can't possibly be pregnant. Irregular periods are common at your age.
If you haven't had sexual intercourse before, then you're not pregnant. I don't see why you have some idea you can be pregnant. You're a virgin.
If you aren't a troll you need to learn how that works. you arent pregnant
while technically you can be allergic to anything, its very doubtful you have an allergic reaction to hydrogen peroxide. hydrogen peroxide is very similar to carbonated water, except its full of extra oxygen instead of carbon dioxide (its H2O2). Very unlikely you are allergic to oxygen... or hydrogen, otherwise you'd be allergic to water (which is possible but you'd definitely know if you were) A common skin reaction to hydrogen peroxide is white scaly skin that may be very itchy. This is not an allergic reaction, and will go away over time. This occurs due to the bleaching or dehydration effect of hydrogen peroxide, and can be relieved with running affected body parts under cool water.
when you get to the hospital, if they have an allergist there I would make an appointment with him/her and see what the number of things you are truly allergic to. It may have not been the hydrogen peroxide, but something else you put into your system before you used the hydrogen peroxide. In the meantime take an antihistemine before you go to the ER, show them what you have taken for the allergic reaction and see a doctor there that can give you a referral to an allergist. Best of Luck
I put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in my ears for 10 minutes each and now I have red itchy bumps all over my body, My chest feels tight and my throat is inflamed. Is this something I can sleep off or do I have to go to the ER? Help!
Please watch a book and learn a few things. Nobody is allergic to hydrogen peroxide. You can only be allergic to proteins.
You might try an antihistamine like benadryl to see if that helps. If it doesn't, seek medical treatment.
I'd be going to doctor
hospital
Yeah really, why did you?
Why the **** would you do that?
And you're the opposite of good. Evil.
You're also the opposite to a Christian, a Jew, a Hindu. Why the need to specify one religion?
So you're little fairy cosplaying f@ggit? Damn sucks to be you
Salam.Because maybe you are friend of them
You could talk to a Priest. I am a Christian who is not Catholic. The Catholic Church acknowledges the idea of possessions and the Priests take helping those victims seriously. You can try to talk to your nearby Priest. They are not all the same so if You find someone who is not willing to help You try finding another Priest. If You feel that You yourself are being targeted then cleansing your home isn't all that You need. See a Priest.
well, young lady- it sounds to me that additional questions are to be asked in real life... and it sounds to me that-more than anything else - you deffinitely and urgently need the professional help of a psychiatrist-in real life-in your area - someone skilled in treating people of your age... inasmuch as needed getting yourself to the Emergency Room at once may have to be done/ considered... until proven otherwise- it might deffinitely be about some mental disorder stemming from some chemical imbalance within your brain- and -if so- it's highly common, it's NO ONE'S fault...and it's treatable ...yeah... do not neglect, please...
Get OUT of wiccan and don't ever associate with that cult again. It's dangerous. You have been exposed to demonic thoughts and practices. Just getting out of it and into a nice happy Christian church will probably clear your heart and mind of all that garbage.
It's all in your head. Like religion.
A priest would help you. He would insist on a psychological and medical workup first, so get that done. Might be diabetes.
It's funny to watch condescending idiots like you try and claim that the numbers are on your side. In case your stupid brain (and I mean loosely) hasn't caught on yet, Trump is dominating the field. As of yesterday, he surpassed hillary in a national poll. Democrat media tries its best to indoctrinate gullible minds, luckily, those same voters are the reason Trump is doing well. So do me a favor, take your condescending ignorant post and place it in a stage where people actually give a fck about the your lies and incompetenties.
You should select those people and send them for proper medical check-up. Here MH is only given highest predominance and emphasis and all other things issues, topics, subjects, stories or politic are secondary.
I'm resigned to the fact that until they grow up and experience the "joy" of paying for younger people, THEY'LL live with their hands out!
I accept it, once they become tax payers, property owners, and parents, their views will change.
Why are the terms "cons" and "libs" bounced around on this site so much?
It doesn't usually happen to "everyone", but it does happen. It happened twice to me, and it truly was scary. But if it does happen, you'll be okay. If it happens all the time, it's not good and you'll need to seek help.
I don't think any, normal people ever even give that any consideration at all.
No, it doesn't happen to everyone. If it happens to you, talk to your doctor about it the next time you are there.
Not everyone.
no, it only happens when you lucid dream
Some dogs do have seizures and need to be on medications......don't give your dog any chocolate.....and yes evil spirits are possible.
I believe they can cause just about any type of health problem but you shouldn't be blaming it on anything supernatural until you have taken steps to rule out any natural explanation.
Yeah you should NEVER MESS AROUND WITH OIJA BOARDS OR TRYING TO COMUNICATE WITH DEMONS. I don't know whether it caused it, but it could have. Its a really bad idea. If things don't get better, you might want to find a spiritual person or medium who can help.
Guess what, stretching exercises and running/jogging help increase height, so get down with it. Drink a lot of water, 3 litre or 100 oz a day, and refrain from high calorie but low protein&vitamins content foods. Males grow till the age of 21 approximately, so you still have time, just exercise regularly and you'll be fine. Push-Ups, Pull-Ups both of these are really important. Good Luck.
You'll keep growing until you're about 21. But you probably won't grow that much judging by the height of your parents. Keep eating protein filled foods and hope for the best.
You will probably, but you areunlikely to be a 6 footer. Height is genetic and your parents are short.
First time pain is caused by: * hymen breaking * clueless boys shoving it in while a girl is not yet lubed up * Fingering during foreplay and scratching If you guys took it slow and you were ready - then there should be no pain (or at least only good pain like a head scratch or rubbing). Congratulations.
no its not supposed to hurt ---- a whole mythos has grown up around losing your virginity and the reality is it only hurts and bleeds because the guy is rough and cant be bothered to arouse the lady --- the hymen is a delicate membrane that has probably already been broken naturally ---- there is nothing wrong with you its the other people who accept the myth that have the problem
Everyone is different. Many times girls playing sports breaks it without even knowing.
You should not use any natural remedies on your eyes unless the doctor says it is ok. You never know when the result of these home remedies might cost you your sight. Having dealt with macular degeneration I can tell you there is little as scary as the prospect of losing your sight.
you heard wrong - nothing short of surgery can improve your eyesight
3.5?
the best thing is to stop playing with your penis. too much play has been bad and it will cause more problems so do not watch **** films.Stay away from this.you seen it all. stay away from u room and not be on u own keep busy and do some thing to keep u occupy all the times. eat good healthy diet.write to me and i will send u a diet plan my email is br75@mail.com

Weight loss gren store tea helped me lose my last couple of pounds!!
Coconuts. but only if you climb the tree, and then break open the coconut yourself. Celery is pretty good. you probably burn as much calories chewing it as it has. Its basically crunchy water.
fruits and vegetables. Fish and GRILLED chicken.
Okay thanks :)
I have a healthy way to loose weight. It's a non GMO organic health and wellness plan with It Works. The first product is called thermofit which helps curb your appetite without stimulants so no shakes!!! It also gives you energy and boost your metabolism!!! Then there's the greens which you drink. It gives you all the fruits and veggies you don't get in the day!!! It's a natural detox and natural energy!! Lastly are the Fat Fighters....you take these after your largest meal of the day!!! It help you body not absorb some of the carbs you have eaten. I would be glad to tell you more!!!!!
with your kind permission- I think you need the professional help/advise of a nutritionist-in real life-in your area- someone skilled in treating people of your age... the first most important question is if you need to lose weight- and then how much and at what pace... anyway- you need a balanced nutrition - with plenty of fruit and vegetables, high quality proteins, both animal and vegetal fats( the latter are edible oils), carbohydrates- and an amount of calories tailored to your age, height, real and ideal weight, medical record( diseases - if so, regular prescription drugs- if so),caloric expenditure( for instance your practice of outdoors sports) etc.
LOL... You think replacing a meal of proper food with a shake full of chemicals is the key to weight loss? EAT LESS, EXERCISE MORE. THAT is how you lose 60lbs.
Cut off your legs. That'd be quick and easy. Or...change your lifestyle and get healthy. Health, not weight.
Diet,maybe skip a meal. workout like a madman,cardio.
Get your eating habits and diet right and exercise daily. Cardio and weights.
Wt warchers is good along with exercise.. They have a great program. It works!
have you thought about seeing a dietitian
eat weightless food
My penis isn't sensitive because I've been masterbation for over 14 years. When I have sex with someone I don't really feel much because I have a condom on. I can masterbate with a condom and orgasm but not with a girl. I don't wanna do it without a condom for pregnancy reason's. How can I make it more sensitive? I don't like going on for 30 minutes or more having sex for no reason.
Not unusual to have not much feeling-- the in and out motion numbs up most guys. When you are ready to ejaculate next time, try this method: use your groin muscles to repeatedly contract your balls- like you are trying to lift or pull them up. The repetitive motion should tighten up the scrotum really tight at your shaft base, and trigger your climax and ejaculation-- works for guys who have issues ejaculating while on antidepressants (did for me ) so should work even better on other guys
Doubt if it is masturbation = just getting older can do this. You could try thinner condom or more foreplay before insertion. < M
Don't musterbate
I say its dangerous to convey that message due to medical complications that it leads to. Its basically celebrating cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
My Thought = lindy west can go s~ck a keg of bacon fat. I will celebrate anything that I want ... and it will NOT have anything to do with what "she" has to say. If ignorance, arrogance, and stupidity were measured in calories, she'd weigh 4,000 pounds.
I don't know. I never heard of her. Or the, "Fat acceptance" movement. I'm all for pulling the ideal of beauty away from something that is unhealthy to attain. Anything beyond that, I can't offer an informed opinion on let alone link it to theism and atheism in any way.
Never heard of a lindy west or the movement..... IMHO
who? Edit: Also Gluttony, the love of food is a bad habit. In the bible gluttony traditionally was considered kings who ate tons of food and puked up just to eat more, which is why there is a bible verse saying "It is better to put a knife in your throat" more or less as a warning of associating with people who had bad food habits, among some people, in terms of bad influence and habits transferring. So its not really respecting your body more or less.
Why don't we also have a self-mutilation acceptance movement for kids? If we're going to pretend harmful things are good, why don't we just modify firetrucks so they shoot napalm instead of foam?
I think she needs to stop gorging on M&M's. As for fat acceptance, I believe people need to be aware that being obese is directly linked to many diseases that can kill you. If you're okay with that, and don't ask for care when you have heart disease -- because you ate yourself to 300 pounds -- then I'm fine with it, too.
I don't think celebrating unhealthy lifestyles is a good idea.
Just more anti white bs
Go by what the package says (so uncooked.) No, the calories doesn't double unless you're adding things to the water so make sure you account for those as well.
Not unless you add butter or cooking oil to the water
Are you eating it boiled? Then measure it boiled. I hope this helps.
water doesn't add calories.
You need to shower everyday especially since your 14 that's around the age of puberty when your sweat starts to smell bad.
You need to shower or bath at least once a day to maintain proper hygiene. If uncircumcised then you must retract your foreskin fully to wash away all the smegma and stale urine (both waste products) from under it. Failing to do so leads to nasty odours and eventually to serious infections.
check the material of your pants too, cotton is better to transpirate
ask your parents
yes it's normal
lol It´s totally normal. That woman probably just didn't realize it
Tell her if she was really working out, she'd smell too.
you should have invited her to your place where you both could have "cleaned up"..................wink, wink
she must be new.....
Go slow and easy, explore her body fully and spend lots of time on foreplay. That will make it more memorable.
Make sure that you wear a condom so that you protect her against unwanted pregnancy. You still need a condom even if she says she is on the pill. If you are uncircumcised, make sure that you wash your penis properly shortly before having sex. You also need to have your foreskin fully retracted to expose the entire glans (penis head) and the 'groove' behind it before putting on the condom. It is the exposed glans rim contacting the vagina that gives both of you the stimulation and pleasure you need.
Probably woke up by your own scream during a bad dream
Perhaps you were dreaming...sounds like sleep paralysis.
It was actually part of your dream, but you thought that it was real.
You dreamed it.
Urine is sterile. The aids virus cannot survive without a human host and also must also come incontact with your blood in order for you to become infected. Hepatitis can survive on in a min ate objects for up to ten days, but again it must come in contact with your blood. Translation: you're fine
No, Those sicknesses are only from ingesting other peoples fluids.
Only possible is you have an open wound on your hand.
i just threw up a little
No, you washed well. You should be fine.
No you will not.
I forgot to mention sometimes I can think about death and like just black nothing there if that makes sense and if I think about it for to long I go into a extreme down mood for weeks until it leaves my head and it jumps in and out and I start to either cry or go crazy because I don't wanna think about it but there's nothing I can do I have to distract my self or its in my mind for weeks on end and it's a horrible horrible feeling and thoughts
What you describe is not a manic episode. This is not bipolar disorder. This is depression, with emotional lability. Bipolar disorder is not just having times your up and times that you're down. But the diagnosis doesn't matter. Whether it is depression or whether it is bipolar disorder, you need to see a medical doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment.
No, you do not describe mania... mania is much more than just feeling good for a few days.... mania is extreme. It affects your sleep patterns, sexuality, appetite, motivation, judgment, the speed of your thoughts and speech, and much much more.... It sounds as though you have depression. It is normal for depression to come and go. It is normal to have days where you are happy even if you are depressed. It is normal to have wildly fluctuating emotions when depressed. Depression is not trivial.... depression can and should be treated. You should go see your doctor.
Yup
We don't know if you will lose weight. To lose weight you have to make sure the calories you consume are fewer than your body needs to maintain its weight. So record your calories and the number that you burn. Do the math. You need a calorie deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound.
Note that, you should look for a slow but constant loss of weight if you diet and increase your exercise. If you initially see a significant weight loss over the 1st few days, it is most likely just going to be water, don't expect it to continue.
if you are doing all these and your calories are burning fast then you can lose weight.you should also take this drink (one glass normal hot water,add one table spoon of honey and one lemon juice then mix it well.)daily before breakfast.it will also help you to losing your weight.
If you burn more calories than you consume, you will likely lose weight.
Depends what you weigh now...
It'll gradually increase in volume over the next few months. Also, JO just once or twice a week, can help with that as well, although for most guys your age, that's pretty much 'Mission Impossible'.
Normal - adult size erect and semen can be clear, cloudy, white or even grayish. May get more white as you mature- or not. Not all guys have really white opaque semen. By the way sperm does not make semen white, sperm is invisible without a microscope.
It will be white the more you ejaculate. Not that it matters....
If you were in a really hot place or was moving for a long period of time, the sweat glands on your butt while start sweating (like it does on the rest of your body), but since you're butt is covered in pants or shorts (or whatever you're wearing on your butt), that heat gets trapped in there and makes your butt very, very hot, causing it to sweat, A LOT, until your whole butt is soaked in sweat, making it feel like your butt is wet.
You let a wet fart maybe. Or you sat on the toilet with the seat up. Or you just wet your pants when you were laying down. I really have no idea why it is wet. Did you forget to wipe yourself after you went to the bathroom?
You've wet shît yourself.
I'm not sweaty and I don't a cat
You got swamp a*s my friend.
you must not have been potty trained very well
you sat in cat urine
Wipe it. Gross.
no
Yes, your penis is a wonderful size.
I'd not get too attached to this girl if she makes fun of her "boyfriend's" penis. Yours is in the top 10% so likely much bigger than the other guy's but girls like that are not satisfied with anything.
Did she just mock what his prev bf penis size, you better prepare for it, picky girls dont get satisfied easily so brace for better impact.
oh boy she mocked them for size? well then you better get a penis enlarger because satisfying size for picky girls is 8 inches.
Yes it is more than enough and your girlfriend will be completely satisfied. If she is going around Mocking other people's penises, than she is the problem. Not YOU.

I urge you to be a pacifist. one approach to being a pacifist is being so lackadasical that Im not even watching the reference url here that I think is more persuasive than me at urging you to be a pacifist. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrnKzGZ6... One _theory_ is that people hit, because they have heard of hitting. so instead of hitting i urge you to have a good time online all day at school. really if they have a policy you could just go to the library n use the computer all day on those last 16 hours
My sincere advice. Consult a good astrologer. He will suggest an auspicious time for you to take up this adventure. It is a good attempt, which I appreciate.
Honestly, yeah. Punch him in the face. If you get expelled from school, you're 11. Who cares. It's not going to go on your record for anything important.
((HUGS)) You need to go to your counselor at school. This is sad they have gotten away with this!!! If you hit them you will likely get suspended. Id go to the office first thing in the morning! Praying for you.
Im 13 years old and i already hit puberty last year when i turned 13. When i got an erection last december (about 3.5-4 inches), i saw the whole head of my penis, and i saw my frenulum and was able to retract my foreskin. However, i noticed that not a lot of boys are able to retract their foreskins at 13 and i wanted to know if this is normal or not. Also, if i have my full retractibilty, does that mean my penis wont grow anymore?? Does it mean that my penis will stay at 3.5-4 inches forever?? Plz answer my questions cuz im worried abt it
Your foreskin being loose enough to retract has nothing to do with your penis growth. Just 13, will grow until about 15 on average. No worries dude, and you probably started puberty at 12 or so before your pubes started growing. Some guys won't see their foreskin retract until 15-17 and that is normal, but you are normal as well.
Your foreskin should actually have become fully and freely retractable by around 8 years old and you should have been washing under it daily from then on. Ability to fully retract your foreskin does not affect its growth - on the other hand it is possible for an overly tight foreskin to limit the growth of the glans under it. Now that you can retract your foreskin, don't forget to do so at least daily to wash well under it and remove all the smegma and stale urine (both waste materials) that constantly collect there. Failing to do so leads to nasty odours and eventually to serious infections.
The pills I have purchased from Prolargent 5x5 Extreme website have worked as advertised. Lots better than Levitra and Cialis. Wife loves the feeling I can now give her.
I'm 17 and I'm 5'8 121 pounds at 10 percent body fat People say I don't eat enough but I usually eat a lot more than people that are fat and I eat about 2500 calories a day easy I try to eat a lot to put on weight it just does not work how come I can eat more than someone and still be so skinny I see people just nibble on a little of food here and there and they are fat
Doesn't sound like you're skinny at all. You eat well enough to get that many calories a day and you're 121 pounds..which is completely healthy and normal for your age and height. I really don't see the problem. As for the thing between you and your friends it's basically the difference in your metaoblisms.
I was gonna say "get married, that will fatten you up" but then I saw you're a guy.... You're 17, it will catch up to you eventually. That is, if you don't watch what you eat, you'll pack some weight on in the next 10 years or so.
You're not skinny
You just have a faster metabolism than others. Nothing you can really do about except wait until you get older, it will slow down with age.
Fast metabolism
My boyfriend has broken up with me because he can t deal with my bi-polar/ depression. He tells me to go get help and I have been trying but it is so expensive, he makes it worse as well... So he has kicked me out on the street and I m living in my car. He didn t seam to understand this is where I need him the most and he didn t want me around he can t deal wi it and it is making me worse as my family have disowned me and I have not 1 single friend. Is there anywhere in Sydney that can help me? It is my fault that this relationship has broken down?
Not your fault, you just need to get treatment for it. Don't you have insurance? Or a job? Depression is common but easy to treat. It means your brain produces insufficient serotonin which causes all kinds of problems. Find a dr. who will take payments and give you discount if you have no insurance. Ask dr. for Zoloft, an excellent antidepressant. ------------It takes 2-3 wks for your body to adjust to it, during which time you will have trouble staying asleep. But after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, confident, happy person.
No. You are not a bad person It is not your fault that the relationship broke down. You just met a guy who wasn't compatible with you. Go to counselling
no, hes the one thats bad, and also, theres programs out there for people that cant afford medical care, you also might be able to get on disability if you havent already
Doesn't Australia have free medical care???
Your boyfriend's the one who needs help. Total bastard.
it is not your fault, he is an idiot. surround yourself with people that are kind
Heating pad. Or Neurontin, which eases nerve pain. I take it for migraines. Non-narcotic.

I'm a 16 year old male and I'm 65 pounds overweight and I have purple stretch marks. I really want to lose all this weight and have a nice thin toned body but I'm not sure if it's possible. I really don't want any loose skin or saggy skin. I'm willing to work super hard I should mention to get this body.
Of course it is. You will have to be tough on yourself when it comes to dieting and excercise though. Maybe go along to a slimming world, or weight watchers meeting and they'll give you some advice and support on the diet side. Excercise, maybe start walking and aim to do 10,000 steps a day and build up what you can manage. Good luck.
Of course you can. You're in your prime to build a solid foundation. If you put in the work now, you'll look like a Greek God by the age of 21.
I bought Argan Rain and have been using it twice a day like it said, (though sometimes I forget and use it once), and I notice an amazing difference in my stretch marks . They were a bright red, and now they have faded to a light pink. I can't wait to see how it will look in a couple more months.
Anything's possible if you put really get into it. Just make a strict diet and workout very hard and soon results will appear later

I'm a 17yo girl and my 14yo brother broke his arms skateboarding, and since we have a close relationship he told me he's horny and can't sleep at night from not being able to masturbate, so he asked me to make love to him. Is it OK to help him if we we care for each other a lot, I think he's handsome, and he thinks I'm beautiful?
Yep, that's ok. Your little bro asked you to help him, and it sounds like you would be happy to do that. Just be sure to make love to him with slow, gentle, and deep strokes while he's laying on his back since he can't use his arms. You said your younger brother thinks you're gorgeous so he probably won't last longer than a minute, but since you think he's a cute hottie you will probably get rewarded with a nice orgasm too. Good luck and enjoy :)

You CANNOT "train" your waist. What exactly do you think you will train it to do? Roll over? Play dead? A corset is simply an undergarment that squeezes all of your fat down. The minute you take it off, your body resumes it's natural shape. Do NOT get sucked into the scam..
Try to loose weight first, until you reach your goal, or close to it. Make sure you loose the weight in a healthy way, like going vegan or cutting down sugars your body doesnt need. Once you have got to your target weight, make a decision whether your waist looks good or if it needs more training.
Being over weight usually indicates issues with physical exercising. Why? When you burn more calories than you eat, you should feel ur appetite decrease and/or becoming more normal. Some people live with a habit of eating more than necessary and I think a possible way to change that is to properly increase your level of physical exercise
It's very good to have strong abdominal muscles (and equivalently strong back muscles). That's worthwhile in itself. Fat depostition is goverend by genes. If you put on weight first around your belly, that's where it will come off first.
Waist training is a scam either way.
You're confusing inches with centimeters.
You're lying. 14 year olds don't really have a penis that big. But yes, 9 is way too big.
Well it wouldn't fit all the way in a woman's vagina. That would be a very sad thing. Not very satisfying for you anyways.
No dick is too big
No! It's way too small.

When I was a student the most selective exam/contest in France had a 8hour-long part. Taking sandwiches was allowed and advised. But if it's not a possibility, my advice is: 1) On the morning, eat *fat*. Slow sugar is better than fast sugar but fat is better than everything else. Bacon and butter are your friend. 2) Eat something else just a few minutes before your exam. Bananas are ideal: both convenient and with nice nutritional properties.
A Banana, Greek Yogurt, and 1/2 Bagel with Cream Cheese.
Eat a pizza and take a burger & block of cheese with you Final resource: just eat you exam
Take a banana in with you if it is allowed. Sugar snacks will give you a sugar high and then a quick sugar crash making you more tired. A little water (i.e. don't fill your bladder) and Banana, these have lots of secondry protiens and they release energy more slowly and will not make you tired.
Eat scrambled eggs and whole grain toast. Having a cup of coffee might also help.
Porridge or boiled eggs or both. They both take a long time to leave your system. Can you really not go without food for 2 hours ????
Protein. Bacon and eggs or sausage.
An egg or two, bacon, sausage, and hash browns

Why do you assume you'll get any diabetic complications?!? You should not really get any complications of diabetes as, if you do, that says you will have failed to manage your diabetes properly and you will have failed to look after yourself. Get control of your blood glucose levels and keep control of them. That way, you won't get the complications, but will go on to live a healthy life for many years yet.
Thank goodness you received a sensible response from amy lynn. You are MUCH MORE LIKELY to develop diabetic complications if you allow blood glucose levels to stay 'out of range' for several years. Other than that, if you maintain good blood glucose control, you MAY go for decades before developing any sort of complication, and MAY even live the rest of your life without developing any.
Take care of your sugar levels. BAD SUGAR LEVELS are what cause all the complications. Do everything you can to learn how to correctly count the carbohydrates you eat and correctly use the insulin based on what you eat. If you learn how to manage your sugar levels, you will have many years with no or few side effects from your diabetes. Keep your daily sugar levels in control and keep your A1C in control and you will avoid most of the worst things that can happen to diabetics.
5/8
5/8 is bigger because 1/4 = 2/8
ok so 1/4 is less than half 2/4 would be half. 5/8 is more that half 4/8 would be half making 5/8 the bigger fraction
5/8 is more than double 1/4.
5 divided by 8 is 0.625. 1 divided by 4 is 0.25. 1/4 is 2/8. Which is bigger, 2/8 or 5/8?
Cross multiply and you'll get your answer to that question.
Sometimes when a woman has an iregular cycle (period) a gynecologist will prescribe certain types of birth control pills to help regulate thier cycle or to help with certain hormonal issues. Yes hunny it is very common for a single woman to use birth control pills, if not for health reasons just because they are not ready to be a mother yet. Be grateful that you have a young lady who is reponsible enough to take precautions. So many people these days are not. I hope that I helped a bit. God Bless Yohanna Ramirez
Before start any kind of birth control pills need to talk with doctor and get best advice . Birth control pills helps to terminate the unwanted pregnancy . Go online with BestGenericStore.com
Common to the point of being more expected than not. The health reason can be anywhere from mental health - Smart enough to not get pregnant when not married - through actual medical - Period regulation. Now you have a mental health check - Do you trust someone else to have absolute power over your wallet for the next 18 years. If you pass that mental health test use the condoms anyways.
I wouldn't say common but I'm single and I take birth control pills. It makes your periods lighter. you should always use a condom though.
The birth control pills can regulate periods, and in some cases are helpful for acne
Birth control is taken to regulate periods, they are also taken when periods are very heavy or painful. Nothing odd in that.
it is common to take pills to regulate their menstrual cycle
All sorts of false reasons that it seems American doctors think it appropriate to hide with artificial hormones.
it is commonly prescribed for acne, to lighten heavy periods with cramps, it is also commonly prescribed to prevent pregnancy

First stage is pubic hair around the shaft. However, some boys experience penile growth, first; and some actually even ejaculate before pubes grow. That's rare, though. Most of your penis growth will be between now and sixteen y.o. You *may* be teased about being small, yet ironically, guys who are big, early, suffer the same thing. Not much you can do about it. Laugh it off, say it's in hiding, or - what are you looking at, pervert? - if someone hassles you.
If you have even one pubic hair... You started the first stage of puberty. Penis size typically does not change much during puberty until around age 14. Most of the penis growth takes place between age 14 and 16. Boys typically reach their completed, adult penis size by age 15 or 16.
At 14 you are likely well into puberty-- betting you have pubes and have had for some time. First outward sign of puberty is generally pubic hair and sudden random erections. Average adutl erect size is reached 14-15 and is 5.16 inches.
You are experiencing puberty assuming you have pubic hair for some time, body changes, random erection occurs more frequent, penis size will grow till your 16.
First stage is 'start' You worry about your penis a bit later 1 - 3 years time. http://www.healthy-relationship-dating.c...
Wait for 4 years and then tell us what size it is...
it'll grow why are you worrying too much. a boys penis grows on its on time being so just wait for it to grow I guess.

Yes. The average penis size for men in their adult years is 4-6 inches.
Yes, your penis of 5 inches will satisfy anyone.
Not anything you can do of course to change your size, but 5 inches is adult average anyway. Good to go. As to satisfying a partner, that takes practice and good skills in bed.
At first, I thought the product wasn't working, but after a little bit of taking the Prolargentsize pills, I've noticed significant results. It's been a little over a week, and I've gained at least half an inch in length.
Yes. 4 inches is good. But you better google and love the art of love making. Size will not matter
Yeah thats fine
average is 5 - 6 inches, so you are average, so yes its fine
never been a problem for me
Yes it is.

According to your other questions you had a surgical abortion about 2 months ago.  Normally they would screen you for HIV as part of the preparation for surgery.  If you want a diagnosis see a doctor (not the ER).  Pins and needles suggests nerve damage or circulation issues.
If you are worried about hiv get an Sti test done. Go to the doctor and ask them to check for cancer and lupus
You don't go to the hospital for a freakin' cold
It sounds like you worry too much and it effects how much you eat.

my partner is a cocaine addict who relapses often he will vanish and watch porn for whole time he uses can be days at a time non stop doesn't want to know me its soon as he does first line of first line and watches gay porn is this normal with addiction he tells me he would never watch anything like that when not using drugs this been going on 2 years
Better move over , soon he will lose his power and lungs/ kidneys
obviously he enjoys it and cocaine can make a guy crave sex and pleasure.
Definitely call the police. Brother should be jailed and, while there, he will have to quit cold turkey. Painful but necessary.
Yes you can it's classed as theft so sorry this has happened to you just phone them and explain what has happened xx
You've been robbed. Report it.
call the cops after you confront him about it

I've heard it was bard, I've been watching since like I was 12, I'm 14 now. How can I undo the damages of porn. I've heard just to stop watching it, which I will, honestly I find doing that pretty easy, but can I still masturbate to my imagination or to pics of like a bikini girls or whatever and still be fine? Like what exactly is damaging, and what is safe. And how can I undo the damages.
Porn makes real sex unattractive and less preasurable coz your wild imagination from porn is not the same as real sex. Porn is also addictive. Thats the only effects i think that may bother you, no other heavy issues. Refraining from porn after you have been exposed to it for a long time may be hard, i am as well struggling to keep myself away from it but its hard so i just let it go, maybe later my mind will stop looling for it.
You can undo any porn related problems by talking to your parents about them. Then, any problems will immediately disappear. Alternatively, try imagining your mother naked.
Your hormones are raging like everyone else your age, it isn't going to do you harm to follow your instincts, but watching porn isn't EVER a good idea, as it IS ADDICTIVE, over time.
No If possible don't at all masturbate. It's not healthy at all for your age. You will face many problems like eyesight loss memory loss only if excessive. You will be depressed and a kinda of hatred and regret towards yourself. Low self confidence No energy always sleepy. Body won't grow fully And later bad sex life It's like you will use all your ammunition when actually time will come that is marriage you will be left with nothing.
Yay masturbation. masturbate as much as you like. Also I have devised a just slightly amusing plan to improve your memory with masturbation. sleep causes greater mental capability; anytime you think you are likely to stay awake and miss out on sleep you could masturbate; cumulatively you will be better rested which supports memory function.
Your brain is in your head, not down there, so it does not affect your memory at all. Masturbation is completely harmless and natural. Ignore people who say it makes you blind or you will go to hell or turn into a frog.
No, masturbation does not cause memory loss.
no it can't
Is it female or male? Female dogs don't have sex with you, they at best stand there while you have sex with them. Kind of like female people now that I think about it. Damn female everythings!
Absolutely.
Is it fixed? That may be the issue. Or maybe you aren't a very attractive dog
No ones interested, little boy. Just go back to your sad, lonely life and leave the grown ups alone
because you are not a dog. simple!! :)
It is very very difficult, and possibly impossible, to rehabilitate pedophiles. Few have been identified as being rehabilitated, and these "cured" cases are disputed. So while your idea might be reasonable, it's debatable if it can be achieved. Chemical castration has some effect, but that's pretty extreme. I'm a psychologist.
They claim t is a natural urge, and they do not have to be subject to brainwashing, and the same politically correct liberals that gave us gay marriage and perverts in school restrooms will not allow it.
What ?they can not be rehabilitate I think! They can t be free either
No.
I have large labia, and my husband of 25 years has always joked about them. It is just good-natured teasing, though. We have great sex together. I really don't think men are concerned as much about your labia as pleasing you in bed and being pleased by you. Consider that there are men who worry about a penis that curves or angles. It will probably feel just as good as one that is not like that. It's all about the relationship that counts. A guy who really cares about you will not be worried one bit about the size or appearance of your labia.
don't worry. guys only care what your pussy feels like
I think that's great! :) Speaking of insecurities, what do you think of small penises? Please be honest, mine is just 4 inches long, yes that's erect.
they are all beautiful

You may resume your normal activity, including football, cycling and masturbation once you are completely healed, which generally takes about 6 to 8 weeks. Your doctor should have told you what to expect as far as how long it will take to heal. You can assume that if the doctor tells you it is OK to return to sport that it is also OK to masturbate.
If I remember correctly, it took around 2 weeks to heal. But I did not do any heavy activity until the 4th week.
Should be able to do any usual activities when it is no longer sore.
you should be normal after 15 days
Your penis gets about 9 erections during your sleep cycle and you simply wake up with the last one. The penis tissues are being replenished by circulating more blood during your sleep. But can be embarrassing.
It's normal for men to wake with an erect penis.
Men always awake with a erect penis. Normal, between having to urinate and blood flow men are always hard in the mornings. Just curious how your sister would ever see such when you don't sleep in the same room correct?
she likely seen bigger
A fever is typically caused by an infection or illness of some kind. The temperature in which you sleep has nothing to do with disease. Since bacteria and viruses prefer warm places, you are much LESS likely to develop an illness in a cold room.

8 hours
Maximum eight hours sleep at night for healthy and fresh mind
You need a lot of sleep during adolescence. Your body is changing from a child into an adult. Everything is changing; physically, mentally, emotionally - and your body needs to rest. 8-10 hours is not unreasonable.
Well a general rule of thumb is around 8 hours. Everyone is a little different.
Just sleep 8 hour i mind that
During more rapid growth periods, at least 8 hours.
i would say 10 hours a night sounds fine
Eight to ten. Peace.
you have to look to where you are going before you start, not after you come to a sudden, rude and unexpected stop !!! you'll be ok in a cpl days
Thats your fault

So, the wall came to you.
I wonder why it hurts?
Why would you do that?
yeah? so? what did you expect?
I am exercising every day of the week for 40 minutes and I eat about 1350 calories per day. I am 5'2" and I was 140 pounds. I reached 125 pounds so I have effectively lost weight. However, a few days ago I felt dizzy while working out. Should I take rest days, for example on the weekends? Or could my dizziness be something else?
I'm no fitness expert. I think they say it's ok to work out every day as long as you're not working the same muscle groups. I don't think it'd be a bad thing to take a day off and let your body recuperate. The main thing I would say since you said your getting dizziness is are you hydrating enough? If you don't that probably what's getting you dizzy.
depends on what you're eating. calorie count is not the only important thing. your body needs certain types of food, and EVEN SUGAR in order to be truly healthy, and capable of burning calories. you should DEFINITELY stop exercising if you feel faint, but the exercise may not have been the source of the problem...
Dizziness is probably dehydration. If you want to add muscle you should rest between workouts. If you want to lose fat, you shouldn't. Presuming your body can take it.
Well - that's religion - it's insanity. Apparently you're supposed to be ENTIRELY dedicated to god before anything else - children, wife, job - whatever. The only problem is that god doesn't really exist. So the heavy believer like this is bound essentially to nothing - to some stupid fairy story. It's really crazy. How did Osama bin Lauden get those guys to drive our airplanes into the World Trade Center???? It was the use of this same insanity.
This pastor should know God doesn't require human sacrifice.
Your thought was correct. He's as bedbug cray-cray as an ISIL terrorist, and for exactly the same reason. The way to react would be to never return to any church that employs such a lunatic.
First, the Pastor knows that God would not ask him to do anything that is sinful. Killing another, especially a loved one, is murder.
If you think that this life is the end of existence, it makes no sense at all. If you think of life on Earth as one step in existence, obeying the God in charge in such things makes more sense. Not religious myself.
...because you thought like a thief, and a "man of the world" rather than one who correctly had seen with spiritual understanding the sacrifice of Jesus upon the cross.
He is an idiot. His wife is his own flesh. Or He does not love his wife. In either case, you are correct.
Was Abraham insane or did God make him great?
He is a good pastor.
That is normal, your jaw is bruised. My last extraction took a couple of weeks to settle down.

You're slacking. Take a coffee break and come up with a better question, you can do it!
Atheists are just the same as Christians or Muslims. The only difference is that atheists don't worship a spirit in the sky.
All humans are apes. Atheists are slightly more human than Christians.
The last time you ate an egg, what was the hatch date of the chicken that laid that egg? You can use the date to calculate the answer to your question about atheists.
Talk to your doctor. The solution will probably involve a scalpel, but it sounds relatively easy to fix. Did you know that some boys are born with dickholes on the side of their penis? Don't worry about it.
Thanks man, appreciate it
Meet a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Do not leave it like this.
You definitely are. Try to make some friends. If it doesn't get better, talk to someone about it. Thanks for answering mine!
It would take a few hours, and it would probably kill you. The testes are attached to a huge bundle of nerves, and damaging those nerves can cause the pain center of the brain to overload and create such a strong adrenaline rush it causes a heart attack. I recommend just using a hatchet if you're going for that result. It's quick, doesn't kill you, and won't create a nasty case of wet gangrene.
Depending on how tight your scrotum was tied... It could cause irreparable damage in less than an hour. If it was not tied too tightly, it may take several hours before they are damaged Beyond repair. Once the blood supply is cut off to your testicles it doesn't take long for your testicles to die.
You're treading on the leading edge of science, here. Let us know your results.

Why do you want to do that? Probably a few days, but you could have worse problems if you do.
See you doctor NOW, BEFORE YOU KILL YOURSELF!!!!! even accidentally.

Well, if your parents care about you, they will help you. If they don't help you, someone else will. But it's worth telling your parents, because they really can help you and most likely they will. Good luck, and never be afraid to confide in your parents, because that's what parents are for (:
My avowed policy in life is: "Help ever and hurt never" Since there is no question from your side, I will obey and try to do whatever things you want me to do to protect your interests.
As someone who suffered absolutely horrendous periods for years, go on the pill and take it continuously. I was permanently tired, had awful cramps, and some days just couldn't leave the house. Lying down on the sofa with a hot water bottle and taking pain killers was the only thing that helped. Had I known there were options like taking the pill I would have jumped at the chance. Don't ruin your life let alone spend so much money on sanitary stuff. Get to your doctor and get sorted. Best of luck.
Long time ago I had very heavy periods and changed maxi pads every 2 hours and I was like that every month for 40 years and I did take the pill but it made no difference except make me gain weight. If you want to take the pill go ask your doctor or planned parenthood clinic
In my personal opinion you should go on the pill if your periods are that heavy because it won't be pleasnt for you also you can get different kinds of pill so the doctor will be able to tell you what one would be best for you
Bleeding thru a pad in 6 hours is not considered "heavy bleeding".. It is reccomended to change a pad every 3-4 hours. So, naturally, you WILL bleed thru if you extend past the recommended time frame. Its not medically considered heavy bleeding unless you are bleeding thru a pad within 1-2 hours. Chunks are normal.. You are shedding the endometrial lining of the uterus. And because its made from components of your blood, it acts similar to blood, including clots. What is not normal is passing huge clots (size of a plum or larger) Yes, you can take the pill if a Dr prescribes it. How you discuss it with your mom is on you.
Unless you're sexually active, I would refrain from taking the pill. It's honestly not good for your body. It can also cause a lot of other health issues. I just remember I took the pill and it made me extremely sick and nauseated. I always felt ill and agitated. I know things affect everyone differently but if you really feel the need to get on it, then make sure you get something that'll work for you.
I think it is normal because when I started to have my period I think I was 13, 14 years old my period was heavy and full in few hours I was having my period sometimes for 5 days or 1 week now it changes since I was 17 or 18 it's light and it comes only for 3 days no more so just be patient you will be fine...
I have to have pills given by the doctor because I have heavy periods, so go to the Doctors.
Boobs come in all shapes and sizes, and guys like them ALL. I wouldn't worry about it. A guy will be delighted to look at or touch your boobs.
15 is young but start complaining about back and neck pain and you can fool your insurance into paying for a lift/reduction. About 90% of the time, they look FAR worse than before but, who knows, you might get lucky.
embrace your boobs! everywoman has a completely different set of breasts. some have tiny ones while some have big droopy ones. and the best part? no one will care what they look like except you!
The best thing you can do is get used to them. The sagging may be genetic and there is nothing, short of breast surgery, you can do to change their natural condition.
That is all normal and the case for many women. unfortunately what we see on the internet/tv makes us feel like it's not normal. it is though
push ups and good posture.
So me and bf dry humped /grinded in underwear and he precummed a little but I heard That cannot make you pregnant. But I'm still worried. But we did that on the day after my period ended. Now it's been 2-3 days since and I'm having brown discharge ?!!???!! (its like a lightish brownish color) Is that my body getting rid of all the blood from my previous period? Or is it something else ? Please help and also I haven't had much of sex education while growing up. So please let me know all that I need to know about this. Thank you!
You could be pregnant..maybe..maybe not..go to a dollar tree or dollar store and get a pregnancy test and see! And the brownish doscharge is probably just a mixture of blood and fluids from you vag discharging out. Wouldnt worry about that.
Unless something is wrong within your body, it is highly likely that it is the end of your period which tends to be brown for many people. Also pre *** CAN get you pregnant! But what is happening to you would not be connected to the event and pregnancies.
Oh my God, you're pregnant!! Quick, get to a doctor....Just kidding, you're fine :) You better read up on women and periods before you try having sex again or next time I might not be joking.
Definitely can be, I checked mine once through a microscope and had swimmers. And it is not because the recent myth that says guys might have residual sperm in their urethra from the last time they ejaculated and precum picks it up-- precum comes from the prostate where sperm is mixed with semen, so when the precum is produced there and other glands it can readily mix with available sperm cells in the prostate. Good reason to always wear a condom- and that recent myth that says you can wear a condom, have sex, ejaculate, then go pee and go back in without a condom for round 2 just makes more guys called "daddy".
Yes, there can be Trace Amounts of sperm in pre-ejaculate
Yes, not much but it can be present.
Yes, there is.
yes urine too
Img requires 5'7" and up. Nobody here knows how tall you will be. It depends on the height of your parents, your height percentile at birth, 3, 5 and 10 years old, and when you got your period. Nobody just becomes tall as a teen. The girls who are tall enough to model have always been taller than average even as little kids My best friend is 5'10" and was the tallest kid (boy or girl) in our class until 7th grade when some of the boys started growing taller.
Most girls stop growing 3 years after their period starts. It is unlikely you will be 5ft 7, the minimum height. You are more likely to be 5ft 4 or 5. I was taller than you at 14, but still only made 5ft 5.
Women stop round 15. You are unlikely to reach 5.7 so start thinking of career plan b. What you want is immaterial.

Phukyahu gave an actual official definition for narcotic. that being said it could be anything from caffeine to meth to heroin, only on of those is derived from opium. most illegal drugs I know of, are considered narcotics but not all. it doesn't have to have any connection to opioids or opiates but many of those kind of drugs could be considered narcotics.
A narcotic isn't an illegal drug. The only time that they are considered illegal, is when you don't use them correctly and abuse, steal them. The doctors can prescribe you a narcotic for things such as pain killers like vicodin.
Narcotics aren't necessarily illegal .You will find many behind the Pharmacists prescription desk
a drug or other substance affecting mood or behavior and sold for nonmedical purposes, especially an illegal one.

life isn't all sweet and innocent, every single person deals with it differently but committing suicide is NOT the answer, there is always sun after a storm, you might feel like you want to now but I promise things will get better for you, learn to deal with life's struggles and get some support behind you, hope this helps
say 'bloody Mary' 3 times into a mirror at 3 AM. if you need to die, she will appear and take you with her. if you are needed in this world, nothing will happen.
Update response, it you are so serious and not just another attention seeking crybaby, why are you still here?
don't do it see your doctor for help ive been there suffered from depression and thought of suicide they will either put you on medication which mine did or refer you for councelling
Don't do it.. Ur big break is just around the corner. Trust me 💜
Tommy is right
The attention seeking is real
Please talk to someone
No sorry you should eat something like the paleo diet but with less meat, more veggies, and some rice. Kind of like chicken stir fry. I lost weight doing that. Don't get it at a restaurant tho make it from scratch
It's better to ask this to a dietitian
No. You need protein and complex carbohydrates. Half of what you eat should be fruits and vegetables. You need dark leaves in your diet, too.
Sounds unbalanced and unsustainable to me.
Hmm, best way would be is to have your blinds open all the way. Other than that tell yourself I want to be up at 6:30 before you fall asleep.
You could ask someone to phone you at 6:30am to get you up? I can't see any other way of getting up at that time with no alarm, don't you have a phone/ipod? Do you have a laptop? (Mine has an alarm on it)
I can't even wake up with an alarm
You need to set an alarm on your phone and keep doing it for years until you get used to it and do it naturally
you'll have to train yourself with an alarm at first.
I use the app pandora. If you go to "settings" you will see something that says "alarm clock" and then can pick the time etc
go to sleep at 6:29 am.
You can borrow my toddler
Black farts smell like stolen food.
Sorry I don't make it a habit of going around and smelling farts and analyzing them...
They smell more generic
The only way to know for sure is to do the experiment. Send me a copy when you get it published.
no they both smell like chicken
Speak to other people you know who take drugs (if you know any) and ask them who their dealers are, ask them to recommend someone. It's really hard to find a good dealer without any contacts, because a lot of them are wary about taking on new customers unless transferred from an already regular customer.
That's very exspensive. You should go to typical areas and ask for bhudda, or green. Try not to sound new to weed and be very strict that u like ur **** before paying. Do not be manipulated or bulied into buying **** stuff. It's a technique many bellends use when drug dealing
In Amsterdam, it's sold from vending machines with different varieties of weed. Copenhagen too.
Yyyy
if u have any friends who smoke weed, ask them who they get theirs from and try to get a hu from their dealer..... unless it's the same guy good luck!
Tell your mom to lower the price, like family discount or something.
you should just quit drugs unless you want cancer and depression
Don't think if your self as an ugly person, think of your self as beautiful on the inside.You know how every one says we're all special? If you don't think you're special( which I'm sure you are special) then you are the only non special person on this planet. Which makes you special 💖😏💖 So nice try but you are special, no matter what
Find a hobby and get some exercise
You have a purpose here in life and you will find a boyfriend or girlfriend but, me i feel the same way you do and i wish to kill myself but, i actually try and life is worth living, your here for a purpose don't throw all that away because of the way you feel trust me it's just how life is things will get better
Everyone is unique and matters! we can be tough on ourselves and judge one another harshly. Think positively. For instance, you are open enough to talk about your feelings. From previous experience people who talk about feelings are good listeners and I'm sure you are a great caring person. Don't compare yourself to others who might seem to have it all figured out. They can put on a smile all day but suffer on the inside. We all care about you! Hope things get better! Sending good vibes!!!!! (: (: (: (: (:
Hi my name is Guy. Please contact me I would love to take you for a drink you sound very lovely. To be honest I am just as lonely as you, not a single friend here and I live in the countryside alone, I just work come home and sleep, I always wonder what is the point of my life, and maybe I should end it. Would love to meet someone, anyone, if you like we could talk. Hope to hear from you soon.
I’m so glad you’re reaching out for some support today. It sounds like you have a lot on your mind, and that can be difficult to handle on your own. It’s important that you reach out to somebody close to you and let them know how you’re feeling. An adult relative, favorite teacher, school counselor, or therapist would be a good place to start. Working together, you can have some long-term support and work through these feelings. Know that you’re not alone and that there are people out there who want you to be happy. Please continue to reach out. PF, Counselor
I think you need a true friend who can understand your feelings. anyways, first of all you should do some meditation because it will recover your inferiority complex and negative thoughts.after this if you have belief in god then chanting OM mantra. do you know when we chanting OM only for seven times it will start protects us from the evil. you can try fake laughing (without any reason) it will also give you positive thoughts and energy....hope this helped
There really isn't a way to get your period faster. It is natural. However, I read somewhere flax seed and soy milk may help since they are high in estrogen. (I don't exactly know how well or if they even work). Also how old are you? The average girl gets there monthly friend around age 12.
You can't get your period faster. When you menstruate is determined by your menstrual cycle, a domino effect of hormonal changes as a result of events within your reproductive system - you cannot speed-up your menstrual cycle or skip phases of your menstrual cycle to get your period to start earlier than when it is due. If you mean menarche (first period) then it certainly can't be sped-up as it depends on when your body becomes mature enough to start ovulating, you can no more speed-up this than you can make yourself grow an extra foot overnight - puberty doesn't work like that.

Here's a warning to all the other girls out there who are interested in going for something bigger. IT DOES STRETCH YOU OUT. Especially if you overdo it like I did. Be careful, try it once but don't be surprised if it hurts like hell. You'll regret it if you keep on doing it, unless you love fisting and having a vaginal prolapse. Now, I'll be waiting for the answers while gracefully having a pity party.
People, you are wrong. Try sticking a fist in there, see if it gets back to its original state if you do it countless times. It does stretch out, it adjusts to the size that enters it. Maybe my paranoia is pretty bad. But i'm sure a vagina won't go back to its normal size after some trauma is caused to it. Like rape, a girl will be so scared that her vagina will clench and the force will damage it. It may heal up in time I guess, hopefully fully.
Regardless of what you stick inside your vagina, or how big the object is, or how often you stick it in, your vagina always returns to its original size and shape. It does, even after you give birth. If your boyfriend thinks you feel "loose", it's most likely not YOU; it's HIM. Perhaps he's just got a tiny penis - did you ever think of that possibility
The guy is a jerk, plain and simple, and he's probably self conscious about the size of his penis and is finding ways to blame you. There's no such thing as a loose vagina except maybe in the first month or so after childbirth and a BABY comes out of it. You do not have a loose vagina, you have a jerk of a guy in your life.
It may not be breast cancer as you haven't mentioned any lumps or bumps but the only way to be certain is if you go to the doctors and get it checked out. It's better to be safe than sorry. Also if you have a family history of the cancer than you are more likely to get it.
According to your other questions you are about 15. At that age the risk of breast cancer is 1 in 1.3 million. Pain is rarely a sign of breast cancer but is frequently associated with hormone changes as part of normal adolescence. Talk to a parent or guardian.
You don't mention how old you are, but you sound very young. If it is swollen and hurts randomly it is likely you have a cyst. See your doctor. Highly unlikely to be breast cancer at all.
Tell your mother how much you are worrying and ask her to arrange a doctor check up, to put your mind at rest.
PRAY< PRAY< PRAAAYYY!!!! ask God to heal you in Jesus' name if you are ever scared! He is the ultimate healer, the best doctor you'll ever find. He will heal you, ask Him, pray to Him, read His word even and ask him to come into your heart while your at it, to change you for His glory!! Make you whole again, physically and spiritually! God blesss you! you have NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT IF, IF YOU DO THIS!

I have suffered with chronic depression for year after suffering sexual assault. I am plagued by sadness and hopelessness daily. I need rest...a long, deep, rest. I do not want to commit suicide. Ive tried Benadryl. I've tried Phenergan. Ive tried Tylenol PM. When I take those I sleep lightly but am arouseable. I want to take something that puts me to sleep so deeply that not even being shaken or a bomb going off would wake me. What can I take that will accomplish this without being fatal? Im 5'7 and 125lbs.
There's nothing that you can get without a prescription, and the prescription medications will all be very dangerous if not properly prescribed by a physician. See your doctor for proper treatment. Things do get better. Let your doctor help you.
Ethanol?
She will definitely think it is big enough given it is 1.5 inches larger in girth than average. Girth, not length is more important and yours is huge in girth. Go slow and easy when you have sex and use plenty of lube as your enormous girth would be difficult for many girls to take. Length is an inch above adult average. Well hung- in fact hung like a mule dude with that girth.
Rather depends on the brain size it's attached to. Also virginity is not associated with getting pleasure. < M
Your penis size is perfect.

you are in a good situation as a virgin, she has no larger di cks to compare yours to

Yes it can. Once you have the will to go on a forty day fast, (eat nothing at all) but you must drink nothing but pure water.Cancerous cells will die off. It is true your body will be thin, but once you come off from a long fast, it is very important to eat nutritious, pure foods (watermelon, any type of fruit juices, etc.) in very small portions until you regain your full appetite. I suggest you get a copy of a book called, "The Science and Fine Art of Fasting" by Herbert Shelton.
It won't heal anyone. The cancer cells will continue to grow and the patient will become too weak to undergo effective treatment.
Your body doesn't get to pick and choose which cells receive nutrients and which cells can be denied nutrients. Starving yourself will only make you lose weight, not cure cancer.
This is dangerous nonsense. If you have cancer these snake oil cures will shorten your life. Steve jobs is dead because of 8 months of happy horseshit like this.
No, it will not heal anyone. If you are starving cancer cells of nutrition, you are starving every cell of nutrition. And you brain will die long before a tumor does.
I wouldn't think so. And even if someone survived it, it would do more damage to the body then good.
No

An armpit lump usually refers to the enlargement of at least one of the lymph nodes under your arm. Lymph nodes are small, oval-shaped glands that are located throughout the body and play an important role in your body’s immune system. The lump may feel small. In other cases, it may be extremely noticeable. Armpit lumps may be caused by cysts, infection, or irritation due to shaving or using antiperspirants. However, these lumps may also indicate a serious underlying health condition. Seek medical attention if you have an armpit lump that gradually becomes enlarged, isn’t painful, or doesn’t go away.
That's just silly. There are many reasons for "You THINK" you have a lump under your arm pit." Go and see your doctor, it is likely a lymph node, very common. You are over reacting. You do not have cancer in any way shape or form, so go to the doctor.
Yes -- you have a lump under your arm pit. It's called a lymph node, You may also notice one under your jaw line, one on each side. You have 500-700 lymph nodes throughout your body. They help remove infection from inside your body when you are ill. When you are ill, you may notice that a lymph node is swollen and feels tender. That is an indication that it is doing its job of removing infection.
Don't cross the bridge until you get to it. Meaning find out before you make funeral arrangements. Radiation from a phone is about the same as your microwave. Not to mention the billion other things that are carcinogenic.
Imagination. And if you can't seriously live without your phone, you've got a serious addiction issue.
Lmfao
Unlikely to be cancer. unlikely to be related to your phone. Having your phone in bed while sleeping risks damaging your phone and is a fire hazard. Silly thing to do.
than see a doctor
If your not bleeding randomly, and not laying on the floor in excruciating pain, you dont have cancer.
Simple, tell the govt to stuff their funding where the sun don't shine. Kids learned more in the turn of the century one room school houses then they learn today with billions in funding.
yeah, there should be a law. you can not legislate from without what you can not find within. the family of heterosexuals has produced a large number of gay children. the heterosexuals are the carriers of the gay genes. https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/20... christian family values? these are your own children whom you are harassing.that is terrible cruelty to a child. where are people sense of community, of charity, of mercy, or even of human dignity? aren't the state legislatures embarrassment enough for the GOP?

Sh*t a lot and make yourself throw up

Yes. People hate trump. He seems to always be right about terrorist attacks. Look at what he said about Belgium as an example. Trump suspected the plane crash was a terrorist attack, hours before anyone thought that it could've been one. Now that people realize he might be right, they're blaming mechanical failures, hoping to stop the trump train. However, the trump train has no breaks. You either hop on or get run over.
Most plane crashes are caused by human error , then by mechanical error and lastly by acts of malice by people By Trump saying that Egyptair crash was caused by an act of terrorism is flat -out irresponsible
Trump was just shooting his mouth off. There is not so far any evidence it was a terrorist bombing, no-one has claimed responsibility for downing the plane, and its descent pattern suggests some kind of mechanical or structural failure rather than a bombing.
This is great, some outlets are reporting that is was in fact ISIS, that they even have security footage of who passed the bomb off, while others are claiming mechanical failure. Egypt, who tried to bury the last terrorist attack in their country becouse it will hurt their tourism, is the one pushing the mechanical failure story. haven't we all had enough of our own media spinning whatever the hell they want whenever they feel like it? Instead of calling them out, we will be arguing with each other, just as planed.
Trump doesn't need anyone to make him look bad. He does it well all by himself. He has no filters. Using his own brain as his only source of information is dangerous, not only for Americans but for people all over the world.
Trump has no special knowledge about the crash of that plane and therefore cannot know if it was terrorists or not. It is not clear from your question who you mean by "they".
The experts said it was sabotage. The U.S. should stop meddling in this business and let Egyptian authorities handle it. I am sure the Hillary News Network and the other one are doing that to make him look ignorant but he has better sources of information than those stupid news channels do.
No serious presidential candidate would come out and say what had happened to the plane before any facts were discovered. He is a buffoon.
Yes
Those kind of loose talk is unpresidential and dangerous, he should wait for facts and evidence before he broadcasts his opinions to the world.

It's individual. To some it is 3 inches while to others even 9 inches is small... You choose. healthy-relationship-dating.com/when-do...
Depends on woman. LOL. 5 inches is not a small penis. < M
Your penis size is normal for your age. No worries. Unless it is Tiny, women typically don't care.

All men and boys irrespective of color, creed or religion do masturbate whenever they get ample time with privacy. Regards.

"Am I overweight?" No you are NOT overweight. You are dead square in the middle of what is a healthy weight got your height. Do NOT let anyone tell you otherwise. Also you are NOT underweight either. At five foot add five pounds to one hundred pounds. Then you have a plus minus to either side, for what is within the healthy range. Minus ten to the low side, and plus fifteen on the high side. However it should be noted that bone structure or bone weight/mass also plays a role in what's a healthy weight. But once again you are NOT by any means overweight.
You already know the answer to this question that your a normal weight. Actually considered skinny but if you are short and you don't ever get taller than 5'6, you really have to watch your weight. Short people can look really big if they go over a certain amount of weight.
The answer is No. Your BMI is 19.8 which falls in the normal weight category. Which means that you are neither overweight nor underweight for your height and weight. So just relax and enjoy.
No you are not overweight at all. Your normal!
Nope, normal is between 95-105, so don't worry about it. Don't do anything self-conscious about your weight, you are fine.
Probably underweight if anything Dnt be afraid to eat a big mac.. They are good I promise
Good Heaven's No! You are perfect.
That does not sound over weight first of all, but second we cant judge without more info
No. Your weight is average. You may gain weight with puberty but it will go away.
No, you're the right size for your age
I had fake nails on for about a 3 weeks now and I started taking them off and I took off my pinky one until I realized that half of my real nail is falling off too but it s half way it s not fully off, right now I have a bandaid over it but I just don t know what to do, will it grow back if I don t touch it. It doesn t hurt as much when it s covered but what do i do?
Let it fall off naturally, it will grow back and don't do fake nails again they are not healthy. If it feels better with a band aid then go with that.
Acrylic nails are hard on the natural nails. You could have developed a fungus underneath the nail. Your natural nail will eventually grow back, but you probably need to remove the acrylic. You might call a nail salon and see what they recommend or go to the doctor for removal. For future reference, soaking them in acetone polish remover helps you remove them with less damage
It should go off just fine
Blood in your semen, means you ruptured a blood vessel- probably a tiny one. Happens occasionally to guys due to the intensity of an ejaculation. Just avoid ejaculating for a couple days to help heal it up. If you notice blood in your urine more than 24 hours, tell your parents and see a doctor. But odds are you won't see many more blood.
No nothing to worry about. Most likely it will correct its self on its own and stop being red very soon. Nothing to worry about.
See a doctor fast
Probably JO'd too hard. Give it a few days to recover, then try again.
Honestly, there's not much wrong with smoking some mj. I was a physics/math major and smoked nearly every night. I made the presidents honor list and became a successful nuclear engineer.

no theres nothing bad or wrong with smoking at all, you just have to make sure that if you're doing it you're responsible about it, especially if you're smoking it daily
Yes.
There is no side effects of masturbation. Masturbation is normal, natural, healthy and safe.
Lower stress, boost in "feel good" hormones, among other positive mental things. The only negative thing would be: 1) Injuring yourself from being too rough. 2) Becoming addicted to masturbation.
Masturbation brings you closer to death since you're losing life force every time you ejaculate. You're going to die if you keep masturbating

Signs and symptoms of testicular cancer include: A lump or enlargement in either testicle. A feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. A dull ache in the abdomen or groin. A sudden collection of fluid in the scrotum. Pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum. Enlargement or tenderness of the breasts. Back pain. Nearly all testicular cancers begin in the germ cells — the cells in the testicles that produce immature sperm. What causes germ cells to become abnormal and develop into cancer isn't known.
You would have to be a cancer doctor.
Btw
you'd notice you'd have balls
You go see a doctor.
what balls
You can't admit yourself to a mental hospital unless you are over 18
Is it safe/helpful???? No clue what that means. If you're mentally ill, having weird behaviors, then you should go and get help.

Whatever arises, love that. "When you're sad, you deserve more love, not less. When you're angry, you deserve more love, not less. When you're heartbroken, you deserve more love, not less. When you're frustrated, you deserve more love, not less. When you're lost, when you're lonely... when you're overwhelmed, and even on the brink of despair, you deserve more love, not less. When you're unable to reconcile the terms and conditions of your of life, and to rearrange the moving pieces into a more palatable and comfortable order - despite your best efforts - you deserve more love, not less."

Hi so I've sorted for about 3 months on 600-800 cals a day (I know it's unhealthy) and now my bmi is 17.8, I am no longer on a diet but I've noticed that now when I eat my stomach gets empty fast resulting in getting hungry fast, and today I binged and less than an hour after the binge I pooped what I ate in that binge (the binge was 1000 calories in one sitting).
That was not from that meal. It was form the prior meal. Your body is designed to want to poop not long after a meal to make room for the new stuff entering the intestines.
No. It means you've been starving yourself to death and your body is desperate for proper nutrition.
I wouldn't say you're overweight. Haha last year when I was 12 I weighed 115 pounds and I was shorter than you. Don't doubt yourself because you're fine the way you are :) Xxx
I wouldn't say overweight, I bet you are just fine and really beautiful. Don't doubt yourself! Plus, you probably are going through puberty so it is given you will add a little weight. But if you are still unsure of your weight, talk to your parents or Doctor. But then again, I think you are just fine, remember, everyone is different and you don't have to look like people on magazines. (But you're probably prettier than those plastic, makeup covered dolls😋)
Yeah, you're a chubber
your weight is fine
yea youre really fûcking fat
You need therapy to deal with your irrational fear. Health anxiety questions belong in Mental health, not cancer. People in cancer are dealing with life threatening illnesses, not imagination
Hypochondria. It's a mental illness.
You actually might have a disease but its not what you think. You might be hypocondriac meaning that you have an obsession with thinking you have a serious but undiagnosed disease.
You're desperate for attention. What you don't understand, though, is that the more you scream, "I HAVE CANCER," the more people will simply ignore you and look the other way. Get help.
Because you are 17 and young adults with massive drama in their lives is a popular theme.
Research, research, that's what I did until I learned enough about "things" to know I was not in harms way.
You really should talk to someone about these feelings. Also, keep in mind that your face hasn't finished changing into the final product yet. You're still in the caterpillar phase right now. ❤
It's hard to accept, but this is probably a situation of normal adolescent mood swings. Talk to your school counselor or nurse but you will probably just have to wait until the moods change.
I honestly feel the same.. Listen to me, there are people who feel the same. I had two friends who commited Suicide and lemme tell you, im not gonna be the third and your not ethier. I keep thinking too my aelf too tell my parents but there gonna put me in a mental hospital if i do.. But maybe i should i need help.. You need help.. Dont struggle like this honestly its horible ive been struggling for two years know.. Please talk too your parents.. Your beautiful they way you are
Go to counselling
Yup
Yes you can
Yes you whòre
Ah, so you gave head and now got sores.... woot
Yeah it prevents blood from entering ur dick at high amounts, which makes it shrink. Only smokers will deny it
Yes but not a problem anymore with transplants available. Recommend you select a black twelve incher.........
yep
no, not really. but you might getting problems with your breathing.
while developing, its very possible, and not just that
no.
It is called fertilisation. The fertilised egg should then implant itself in the womb, causing conception. This would then lead to the growth of a foetus and eventually birth of a baby.
Conception.
ultimately should it survive longer than a days, then it will grow into a fetus and then develop into a baby.

It's horrible, it makes me feel horrible. I've gotten over $200 scamming online. I'm Christian so along with the guilt I also have the guilt of sin. I'm only 15 too, I've almost gotten in trouble with the law so many times. I just cant help it. It's free money, and these people just take the bait. I know it's bad but I can't stop.. is it an addiction or just a want for money would you say? No matter what I can't stop thiugh.. please help.
Do things that make you feel good . You owe that much to yourself. STOP with the scamming ...you can put that behind you if you want to . Figure out what makes you happy and go for it , as long as your not hurting anyone else . It is a daily even many times a day to choose to do things that will be good for you or things that will be bad . IT IS ALL UP TO YOU , GOOD LUCK I WISH YOU THE BEST.
So, that's what Christianity is about? I have never felt comfortable around them, now I know why.
Yo help make you feel even worse ....You have done these things for $200 .....Is the price you are paying worth this piddly amount ?💸
No. You'll be having good sex with everybody, no matter what color they are.
Don't do it. You might be tricked.
I have heard that under hypnosis, you would not do anything you consciously consider wrong.
It's against god
yes!
You are the customer. If you want it removed say so. If he argues or declines explain politely that you will have to ask another dentist to oblige. You must realise that you make the decisions not him. So insist on a local anaesthetic.
Then lie to your dentist.
Not mentally ill. Just very deluded.

Sounds like yet another quack theory with no scientific evidence to back it up. I certainly wouldn't turn to anything so unlikely to cure my cancer.
Drinking your own body's waste fluids might make you ill. Magnets while appearing to have magical properties. do not treat, cure or prevent disease.
urine therapy is an old therapy....the sound of it doesn't appeal to many people, but may help

good question
A friend has a very aggressive lymphoma. It started in her jaw area and eating is painful. Plus now she is starting chemo. She's losing weight like crazy, doesn't feel like eating and when she eats really needs softer food. She can't stand hummus. Any recipes for something that might spark a bit of an appetite or at least tempt her to take a few mouthfuls?
She may be better off with liquids. There are products available at the pharmacy. Ensure is one brand. Meanwhile use a blender. Custards, juices or purees .
Try foods made with Curry. Curry is made from tumeric and a concentrated for of tumeric known as curcumin is successfully used to fight cancer. The problem with our present cancer treatment system is that it ignores natural medicines that are contained in foods. Do the homework on Foods that Fight Cancer.
Not if she's getting radiation to her neck. She won't be able to taste it and her saliva glands may be damaged. It could take several years to recover.
I ate a lot of ice cream
Here’s simple way to deal with cystic and all other forms of acne. Skincare for Acne and Acne scars – suitable for all skin types. Niacinamide (aka Niapads ®) anti-acne pads help keep acne away by scrubbing open clogged pores, oily residues and exfoliation. Feel a pimple coming? Just wet a pad, place it on the pimple and remove it when dry. Sit back and watch pimple disappear. Works on body acne too. These pads also help reduce skin hyperpigmentation (acne scars) and increase skin hydration. Use it and see the difference.
to be honest, pimples sren't serious at all. I'm 13 and ive had so many pimplles, but they dissappeared enevtually. Then new ones came and a few weeks later those were gone too. Pimples aren't something you shoukd be worrying about, trust me. They will heal by themselves. It's just a symthon of puberty
You can try putting toothpaste on your pimples because it makes them dry and then after a few days if you do not touch your face with your hands, they will just dry and disappear. I had 2 pimples on my cheek and used the toothpaste for a whole night and then on the next morning I washed my face. I didn't touch or put anything on my face for 3/4 days and they disappeared. ☆ Sent from iOS Dr. Know! 1.0.01
I've tried every product and home remedy you can imagine.Ive tried alot of over the counter and perscribed lotions with no luck. My bff turned me on to a lotion called Bevoline .It comes in a grey and blue box made by skin divine. i started to see an amazing change within 48 hrs. Good luck.
Avoid greasy foods, sweets, wash your face daily, use a cotton ball dipped in aloe vera gel and dab it on the pimples to dry then up. And whatever you do, don't touch them with your hands or try to pop them. They will clear up.
Some people do not get cervical cancer from HPV. If she did, it would depend on if your boyfriend still had HPV if she gave it to him initially. Most HPV infections clear the immune system after two years. Unfortunately, there is no HPV test for men so it would be impossible to know. You should always practice safe sex with condoms.
What you are saying is if he gave her the HPV it could have been a certain type that causes cervical cancer and will you get this strain - I dont think so but go ask your doctor just in case, Good Luck
HPV is contagious. Hence, you shall get HPV.
Cancer is not contagious. No cancer is.
I'm sorry this happened To you. Next tIke try going to the bathroom before you go out. I would at least try then if you have to go while you out make sure you have full control over where the "stream" goes try to let a little out and if it looks like it might spray again just let it do its thing and then maybe go see your physican maybe they would have some more answers on why this is happening. Maybe if you go into the stall and pull down your pants all the Way it would help. I'm only giving ways it might help. This doesn't mean you have to do it
Next time go into a stall and grab paper towels to soak up the urine- or use toilet tissue. Certainly if there is a hand dryer, splash water on the urine area to dilute and then dry it.
Huh? I'm not sure I even understand what you're trying to ask... Are you telling us that you do not pull your foreskin back when you urinate? If so, why not?
Your fine. You didn't mention your age however you could continue to grow until your late teens to early twenties. By comparison the average adult erection is between 5 to 6 inches. 80% of all men fall into this size category with the other 20% being smaller or larger to some extent.
No. It should be adequate for Dominican women. You don't need to "compensate". I guess men anywhere lie about their size. < M
I'm a teenager and my friend has a bong and some weed. I've always wanted to smoke but I'm concerned about the side effects of smoking. Could smoking from a bong still give you lung cancer? How long would it take for the side effects to wear off? Are there any things I should know before I do this for the first time if I even decide to do it?
Weed does not have nicotine, which is the super-addictive component of tobacco smoke. However, it does produce more than four thousand chemical compounds, many of which are cancer-causing. The problem is, many people do weed for years without noticing the harm it does to the body, so they assume that all the warnings are just old farts and religious fanatics who don't want them to feel good. And when they finally do develop a terminal illness, they have no idea that their indulgence in weed was the ultimate cause. So - if you are determined to do weed, you'll find a way. Just tell your family what sort of flowers you want at your funeral.
Look, dude. It's not safe for teenagers. Even in states where it's legal, it's still illegal for those under 21 FOR A REASON!!! Just like for alcohol, getting high or drunk isn't good for teenage brain development. Peer pressure is intense to do what 'everyone' else is doing - but the dangers are too many to risk. Don't do it.
Do a cost/benefit analysis. Do the costs and risks outweigh the benefits or not? Let's see: jail, health, mental performance. On the other side you get a moment of what might be "fun" but probably won't be.
I am glad you are concerned about the side effects of smoking....that should change your mind right there. Listen to your brain.
Here's what lung cancer looks like in the end. Enjoy.
An ex friend of mine used it regularly, short term he was agitated, irratable paronoid and had body shakes, long term use since the age of 14 to 35 he devoloped drug induced psychosis which led to him attacking people with knives and bodily harm to others, smashing up properties, hearing voices , believing he had hidden micropones in his teeth and having delusiona halucinations , hes now facing court for threat to kill at knifepoint and his mental health has worsened to nothing short of a psycho
Are you going to try to die? If yes then you need to go to your nearest ER. If No that you just want to, the you should go see your doctor who can help you see a psychiatrist and get started in therapy....
I want to see you post a coherent question.
You need counselling
Ok
Please don't. Life gets better.
Not sure what you expect needs to be done, sounds like it is normal for you-- are you sure you are not circumcised? Because you just described what a typical circumcised guy looks like down there-- the foreskin that is left may cover when the penis shrinks up tiny, but normally flaccid the head is exposed.
You are completely normal. A lot of guys are exactly like this.
You either have a short foreskin or a very loose circumcision. Why do you wish to do anything. < M
it's not an unusual stuff. with time it should grow again
You've not described a problem, just a fact about your dick'. It sounds like it's ready for use.
Nah it's normal
does your penis work ? there is a whole lot of normal about a penis like how long, fat, cut, un-cut, straight, bent, but the biggest thing is does it work
You have 500 to 700 lymph nodes throughout your body - around your head and face, under your jaw, in your armpits, in your chest, in your abdomen, and in your groin. Sometimes, some of them may "feel" enlarged. Congratulations! You have discovered a few of them in your neck.
They probably aren't a problem id they have been there that long.
Could be something, could be nothing. Wont' know until you see a doctor.
If they have been there since you were 16 it cant be anything serious
is that YOUR amateur diagnosis or a Doctor's?
So what is your question?
wut?
Actually cocaine is a legal prescription in the us and heroin is a legal prescription in the uk. Also people need sugar to live.
The human body cannot distinguish any difference between refined natural sugar and natural sugar. What are you on about? So let's ban honey, processed by bees. In science, it's the dose that makes the poison. https://youtu.be/8UZJRR8OHhY
Because people get money from processed sugar products. If sugar is limited or not legal, many, many, many businesses and companies will be closed. They don't care if it's unhealthy. They get money, they're happy.
Because I've never known anyone to steal the family heirlooms to pawn them for a sugar buzz.
Because there is no meaningful difference between say, honey and table sugar in terms of chemistry.
Sugar is not drugs Yes its addictive but you can control it

None of those things are going to cure HIV. There isn't a cure for it but there are medications and therapies you can try.
It's not funny to joke about HIV and AIDS.
Slap wallpaper paste on the area.
Erections happen all of the time at all sorts of places, including in the public and at school. There is nothing to be embarrassed about by having an erection and a nice bulge showing.
Prolargent 5x5 Extreme has been the better of the enhancers I have tried. Starts of slow, and build up. By the end of the 4th day I was waking up in the middle of the night with huge wood. I have had a good experience so far, and as far as i can tell this is among the top 3 I have tried.
Yep that is the right place to have erection. I am sure girls are very impressed. < M
Well its normal and something all guys your age have issues with.
wear larger pants, dude
its good advertisment
If you floss at night (and don't eat before sleep), there would be no point in flossing again in the morning (before eating). The idea is that you floss after you eat.
At night so you are sure to remove any and all good pieces that you might have missed. Also brush twice daily (morning and night).
Both. It gets the extra plaque you missed in those hard to reach places. If you must choose only one, night.
both for great health
do it when you have the time
both
I m 15 years old, extremely depressed & have suicidal thoughts multiple times a day. My parents are saying they have found my dog(the only thing I really care about) a new home because he doesn t get taken out enough, but the reason I don t take him out much is because of my depression and my unwillingness to leave my room because I just can t bring myself to go out. I can t tell my parents this because I don t want them to know about my depression and suicidal thoughts, if I come home from school one day and my dog is gone I honestly think I might kill myself. Any advice please? Thanks
You have to tell them so you can be taken to a dr. for meds that will help you get well. ---Depression is common but easy to treat. It means you have insufficient serotonin. So tell a dr. how you feel and ask for Zoloft------ Its an excellent antidepressant but does take 2-3 wks to get used to. During that time, you will have trouble staying asleep. But, after that, you will be a whole new, healthy, happy person with more energy, too.
Talk to your parents and start taking your dog out more.... if you can go to school you can take the dog, you supposedly love more than life, for a phucking walk.
My baby girl has a cleft pallet. She isn't born yet. I am 5 months along. We caught it in an ultrasound. I have 7 other kids. All males. My husband and I have been waiting for a.little girl to come into our lives. We were so exited when we found out it was a little girl. We already picked out a name for her. And then we figured out she has a cleft pallet. My husband says abortion is the best option. Non of our other kids have something wrong with them. So we are so lost of what to do. Could u be so kind in helping Me out?
Your previous questions say you are 17 and then 21 and have a drinking problem and now you say you have 7 other kids? If you were told your baby has a cleft the doctor would explain what will happen - you will be given a special type of bottle to feed baby and when baby is about 12 months old it will get operation to close the cleft, partners daughter was born with a cleft
Are you serious? A cleft palate is something that can be fixed at least to some degree but my biggest issue is what kind of person has 7 kids and then wants to throw one away because she's not perfect?! The baby is formed, has a heartbeat, a brain and even fingerprints. You are the mom you must love her in your heart already! I can't believe you'd be OK with a surgeon ripping your baby girl apart and throwing her in the trash. Your husband sounds kind of sick but I'm hoping he will love her once she's born. Don't have anymore kids after this for Gods sake, nature is telling you it's time to stop.
So your husband has NO problems killing his child????? What kind of person is he???? Cleft palets are able to be repaired now after birth. I'd have a serious talk with your doctor and find out what can be done and when it can be done.
5 months is very late for an abortion, you're not just killing cells - you are killing an almost viable baby. A cleft pallet is simply remedied with a very common surgery. If you want to see what a repaired one looks like, google the actor Joaquin Phoenix. If you are disposing of your child for vanity's sake, then you don't deserve to breed.
I have eight children (married, same dad, never on welfare), seven boys and one girl so I won't attack you on how many you have. However, you have a lot of growing up to do before you have more. In the meantime, I suggest you abort your HUSBAND. With seven kids, supposedly, you know this is no big deal. I feel sorry for your daughter having the two of you for parents. The fact that you'd even consider this is disgusting. IF this is real, which I HIGHLY doubt, you'll deal with feeding issues until the first surgery around five months. You can handle it.
Cleft palate alone is no cause to seek abortion. It can be fixed with surgery and other treatments. Talk to your doctor and your children's pediatrician about it, and go Google "cleft palate." Know all about it before you decide to end your child's life. I don't think it has any impact on their brain or anything else - it just causes some speech and feeding issues, but these can be dealt with. It's a very common thing.
DO NOT GET AN ABORTION!!! My youngest son had a cleft palate, and was treated. Think of it only as a little "speed bump" in your child's life. Getting an abortion over something as minor as a cleft palate is inconceivable. Please do some research and learn more about it before doing anything drastic.
You're an obvious troll. What mother is going to care about a cleft palate? So boring.
What is to stop you from asking this insanely childish and moronic question over and over again? What's wrong with you? Are you stuck on stupid?
You have been posting this nonsense for two years. It's time to stop.
i will believe this when i read medical proof on it and i am fine in that department and i do it all of the time
Couldn't you just look at porn instead of dwelling on this?
You are a strange, sick person. I hope you are getting therapy for your issues.
There is no evidence to support this claim.
Well John, I think you should get out more.
It is not a problem, and no one has any such injury.
I masturbate in that position all the time my scrotum is just fine thanks
Stupid questions... LOL
I will have you know that I pick my nose every five minutes and it is snot free
The difference is that Christians are saved and going to eternal paradise, atheists are gonna burn in their sins.
Points for talking $hi+ to both sides. You win!
What Andrea said (cheers for copying and pasting my answer). I could write out my post again but I'd be wasting my time seeing as it's there for you in black and white. Myself and Andrea have given you all the known possible symptomatic and onset (and even extraneous) differences between unipolar and bipolar depression. Are you asking something specific or just taking the piss and trolling us?
deffinitely there is a difference: whoever sufferes from bipolar affective disorder - at some time will experience an elated, exuberant. overoptimistic, overly self- confident, reckless and potentially dangerous period of time... this alternating - at various paces- whith the depressed phase- with severely depressive mood, lack of energy, sadness,loss of self-esteem, sense of worthlessness, tendency to suicide... both bipolar - and- more than once- unipolar depression as well- stem from some kind of chemical imbalance within one's brain... having to do with the metabolism of serotonine and/ or noradrenaline( neuromessengers). these are common and treatable conditions... not to be neglected- as- inasmuch as left untreated -they may ruin one's life and its quality...
There's definitely a difference. While symptomology may share much in common, the onset is most often VERY different.
